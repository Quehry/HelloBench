We can all see you don't age at all.\"\n\n\"Its the knife trick,\" John remarked, before dropping the knife from a careless flick of his fingers. \"Xavier, you know that one.\"\n\n\"Hah! Good luck stabbing yourself in front in her!\" The old man chortled. \"You've tried stabbing yourself a thousand times, and you always end up dropping the damned knife. That shit got old half a century ago.\"\n\n\"Its new to her. One day, I'll pull it off, and you'll see the knife cut across me harmlessly,\" John shot back, picking up the knife before an impatient Emily who was drumming her fingers, staring off into space. \"Hey, little one. Look here. I got a trick for you.\"\n\nEnough twirling. Or flicking. John gripped the knife tightly and stabbed downward, only for his aim to be completely off so the knife bounced off the dining table and clattered on the floor. Emily crossed her arms, a disinterested sneer etched on her face. Again and again, John would try to slash, cut, hack at himself, but regardless where he aimed, he would strike the table without fail.\n\n\"Boooring!\" Emily boo-ed at him with two thumbs down. \"Could you not pretend to be a clumsy oaf and actually hit yourself for once? I bet your knife is a fake one too.\"\n\n\"You know what, you try it,\" John snarled, offering the blade to her. \"Take it and stab me.\"\n\n\"Grandpa! Don't you give my granddaughter a hunting knife!\" Xavier shouted. \"Put that away!\"\n\n\"It'll be safe,\" the immortal smiled. \"She can't hurt me. I'm fucking immortal.\"\n\n\"A dollar in the swear jar,\" Xavier held the jar out for his youthful grandfather, chiding him as a parent would a child despite being lower on the generation ladder. \"Now.\"\n\n\"Whatever. Here's your coin,\" John scoffed as Emily took the knife into her hands. \"Okay, girlie, let's see you do your worst.\"\n\nShe gentled placed the knife on his hand and began sawing away with a surprising amount of strength for a small girl of eight years of age. Emily stood up on her chair and leaned her weight into the knife. John sat still, unable to stifle a chuckle at her laborious effort. After half a minute, she threw the knife down on the table and slumped down on her seat, exhaling with strenuous effort.\n\n\"You were using the blunt end, girlie. Did you not see that?\" John laughed, rubbing the sore imprint the back of the knife had left on his hand.\n\n\"I wanna try again,\" she frowned, unconvinced of this fluke of John's. With the knife edge closing on his hand, John rubbed the palm of his other hand on his leg, anticipating her reaction to his immortality. \"You're not immortal, you just have sheer dumb luck!\"\n\n\"Emily! Look who's back!\"\n\nShe put the knife away immediately and ran towards her mother.\n\nJohn picked up the knife and —\n\n\"Enough with your stupid knife tricks! John, please help set up the table for dinner!\" His great-granddaughter hollered, dropping her grocery bags in the kitchen.\n\n\"Give me a minute, Bella,\" John said, holding the knife over his thigh instead. Maybe if he kept failing to stab his hand, his approach would have been to go for another part of him to show off.\n\n\"Not now, John,\" Bella unpacked vegetables and moved to grab packs of meat, only to accidentally bump into John so he dropped the knife once again. \"Ugh, could you stop dropping your favourite knife? Get a good grip on it. Or put it back. Dinner's soon. If you didn't stop aging, we'd all thought you survived all your nonsense by sheer dumb luck!\"\n\nSheer dumb luck huh, John pondered to himself. Come to think of it, he's never managed to cut himself at all despite half a century and thousands of attempts to do so after he wished for immortality. He was the sole survivor of a plane crash. The one man standing in the middle of a massive car accident where a dozen of cars smashed into each other due to faulty traffic lights. But being kinda dim, he wanted one last confirmation about how his immortality worked.\n\nWith a deep breath, he held the knife at his heart and —\n\nHis grip loosened and the blade fell to the floor as it always did.

I rarely ventured to this part of the forest but the Bluebell mushrooms for my healing remedies are always abundant in the eastern parts of the first.\n\nThe first felt off, something had changed. The birds' songs seemed fine, they seemed cheerful, and the deer who always followed me on my path seemed happy and as playful as ever, but to my bones, they kept telling me something was off. There was an intruder in my forest. I followed the disturbance, picking up pace as I felt the tension get heavier and then I saw it: a cabin. A human cabin. It was hidden among a thicket of trees, the brown cabin almost belt in completely into my beautiful forest. Inside the cabin was bare, it smelled different than every other man I had seen come into my forest. The usual smell of despair, anger and ill intent that followed humans wasn't there, the cabin smelled wild. It smelled of honey and of the trees, I could smell happiness within, the fireplace wasn't lit but the cabin still seemed warm even in the middle of winter. I got lost in my thoughts, walking around the cabin I was in a daze then suddenly I heard the door open and with a snap of my fingers I melted into the shadows of the cabin.\n\nIn came a man, with an injured fawn in his arms, anger bellowed inside of me. How dare this man hurt a creature in my domain, I steadied myself, ready to cast this foul being back into this own land when suddenly his voice stopped me. Just like his scent his voice felt different, it was soft and caring. \"Now, there, there, young one. It's just a little bruise, I'll get you right as rain, \" the man said as he laid the fawn down on a table that lay in the middle of his cabin. He was younger than I expected, perhaps in his early twenties, with a thick beard that reminded me of the moss that grew on the riverbanks of my forest. The man took out a weird device on from his backside and spoke into it \"Jenny, this is Ethan, injured fawn at the cabin, copy\" As the fawn bounded out the door on steady legs, the man - Ethan, the box had called him - let out a heavy sigh. He stretched so hard that his joints popped, the exhaustion of the long night seemed to be clear on his face, they had been withered by stress. But there was a light in his eyes, even after the hours of countless work his eyes gave off a warmth that I'd never seen in a human before.\n\nI watched from my hiding spot as he cleaned up, I couldnt stop staring at the gentleness of his hands, it was so different from the rough, grasping fingers I was used to. He hummed as he worked, it was a soft uplifting tune and I caught myself staring at him as smiling. For a moment, I almost forgot myself, I almost stepped out of the shadows to ask him about his magic, to ask this handsome creature that he was. I'd been fooled before, taken in by honeyed words and kind faces. I wouldn't make that mistake again.\n\nI watched this creature from afar, I would drive him from the first I would tell myself every day, but every day I would keep putting it off, his innocent kind eyes always seemed to stop me. This man was weird, he did not harm anything, he patrolled the trails where no human had dared show up for centuries, he spent his days clearing fallen branches and mending broken fences. He spoke to the animals like they were old friends, and to my shock, they would all respond to him, even the skittish rabbits would follow him through the forests, the birds would sit on his shoulder and sing their beautiful songs.\n\nI told myself I was just keeping an eye on him, making sure he wasn't up to no good. But if I was being honest, I was curious, I couldn't stop looking at him. It was weird but I was drawn by this man. I wanted to know what made him so different, what magic he possessed to charm the creatures of the forest, including me. I found myself creeping closer, lingering at the edges of clearings to catch snippets of his one-sided conversations with the animals. \"Now, Mister Blue Jay, what's all this fuss about?\" he'd say, or \"Miss Rabbit, you're looking mighty fine today.\" he'd say, giggling after every little conversation. The animals, they'd chitter and chirp back at him and he'd tip his hat at them and walk away.\n\nI had begun to grow careless, I kept getting closer and closer to Ethan, he drew me in like no man had ever done. Ethan looked up from the ground, his eyes met mine as they widened in shock. Oh no, I'd grown careless, I was so focused on his beautiful eyes that I'd let my concealment spell slip.\n\nHis widened eyes turned into an even wider smile. \"Well, hello there,\" he called, his voice was warm and inviting. \"I was wondering when you'd show yourself.\"\n\nI froze, mind racing. He knew? All this time, he'd known I was there? Who was this creature? How could a mere mortal see through my spells?\n\n\"You're her, aren't you?\" he continued, walking towards. \"The witch of the woods.\"\n\nI cringed at the title \"I am no one's ugly witch,\" I snapped finally getting my voice back. \"Certainly not yours.\" But he just smiled, a slow, gentle thing that crinkled the corners of his warm eyes. \"No of course not,\" he agreed. \"You look nothing like an ugly witch, you're far too beautiful.\"\n\nI opened my mouth to argue, to put this human in his place. But something stopped me, I could feel my cheeks warm up, was I blushing?\n\n\"I've heard the stories,\" he said, taking another step. \"About the witch who guards the forest, they said you speak to the trees and command the animals. I always thought they were just tales.\" He faked a laugh \"Guess I should've known better.\"\n\n\"I don't know what game you're playing, Ranger,\" I hissed, \"but I've no patience for it. These are my woods. Cross me, and you'll regret it. I tried to sound as strong as I could, but I could barely stand, seeing the ranger this close to me had turned my legs weak. It was a struggle to even stand up when Ethans emerald green eyes were staring right at me.\n\nAll the men I had met through the centuries, they had all been smitten by my looks. They had all fallen in love with me until I opened my mouth and ruined their little vision of the sweet, innocent girl of the woods, but Ethan, he was different yet again. \"I'm not here to cross you,\" he said softly. \"I'm here to help. These woods they're important. They need protecting. I think we could do that better together than apart.\"\n\nI wanted to take it, his eyes looked so innocent, so kind, but no. \"LEAVE HUMAN, NEVER COME BACK OR YOU SHALL FACE MY WRATH\" I shouted, conjuring up all the magic I could to scare Ethan, but he just looked hurt. \"Oh but-\", before he could finish I vanished back into my cave.\n\nI had expected Ethan to leave that day, maybe to bring more humans into the woods to hunt me like they had so long ago, but no. He still stayed, he was still the kind soul that would talk to the rabbits and draw the wildflowers in his little sketchbook and I was the little witch who would spend all of her time looking at this human from afar.", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: For centuries, the witch lived alone in the dark woods, protecting the trees and wildlife from men in the name of Mother Earth.

They need more in order to save the president's daughter.\"\n\n\"But why me?\" Erin demanded, and blinked as she realized she was actually buying into this lunacy. \"And why do you care?\" Memory brought shame. \"After what I said to you the last time.\"\n\nThere went that smile again. \"All part of the job. And you were very imaginative! As for why you, because they're sure nobody will miss you. At least, nobody with enough power to make a difference. Your obituary will be three lines on the back page, while they get to crow about another 'miracle cure.'\" Acid dripped from its tone and its lips.\n\n\"Okay,\" Erin conceded, \"but how? I don't even have a wheelchair yet!\"\n\n\"That,\" answered the monster,\" is where you have to trust me. I know it's asking a lot given our history, but I can get you out of here and hide you somewhere safe until they stop looking.\" The eyes grew larger and pleading. \"Please?\"\n\nA foot scuffed on the other side of the door. Erin's head jerked up, and she saw shadows pass across the line of light beneath the portal.\n\n\"They're here!\" the monster cried. \"We're out of time!\" A tentacle reached up and wrapped around Erin's wrist. Not as predator to prey, but earnest entreaty. \"Come with me?\"\n\nIt was insane. It was a nightmare. A figment of her imagination. Monsters under the bed, hospitals that used human sacrifice to save lives. She'd hit her head in the accident, and was hallucinating. Had to be.\n\nThe handle rasped as it turned. Erin's stay had settled into a routine. There was no reason for a visit this time of night.\n\nShe nodded, and pulled herself more over the edge of the bed. \"Okay,\" she agreed. \"Let's go.\"\n\nHer legs hit the floor with a slap, but she did not feel a thing. \"You're gonna love this!\" the monster promised, as it pulled her under.\n\nThe door opened, to admit a squad of nurses and a woman in robes, with a bearing both regal and sinister. The woman surveyed the room, and spotted the blanket draped over the edge of the bed. She crossed the room, yanked the blanket upward, and glared at the empty floor.\n\n\"Damn it,\" she muttered. \"They're on to us.\"", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: Now in your mid teens, you forgot all about the monster under your bed.

It is not such a bad place, inherently, but it just doesn't appeal to me... aesthetically. But I've got a bit of a guilt now hanging over me because my grandmother really liked it and I can't bring myself to part with it.\"\n\n\"Oh, believe me, I know the feeling. Had the same kind of neither-here-nor-there with the fifth of Latang, ended up selling it and didn't regret it in the slightest. But then again, in my case fewer emotions were involved as it wasn't an inheritance. Hmmm... Say, have you thought of giving it to the Yellowites?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, \"giving it\"—as in just letting them have free rein? I don't know much about them, if I'm honest.\"\n\n\"Yes and no. Basically what happens is you give them mineral extraction rights for some limited period, say, a couple hundred years (I mean their years, obviously). They take a half and they give you a half; and then, when their contract lapses, they pack up their stuff and leave for greener pastures. Because, well, that's their thing, that's what they do. Most of their history is about getting stuff out of the ground. Wherever they can, they drill and mine. It is rather endearing, really, that a species quite advanced should be still so attached to what's hidden in the dark impenetrability of the rock. Must be something to do with their biology... I can't say.\"\n\n\"And how long is their couple of hundred years?\"\n\n\"Not very long. Well, to them it is something like five productive generations, but it is about two of our Lengths. Manageable.\"\n\n\"More than. And what do I get out of it? Why would I need a half of what's inside Qajorah 9?\"\n\n\"First of all, you get to use your grandmother's inheritance wisely, I'm sure she would've liked it. Obviously I'm not sure there's anything useful inside Q9, but these nosy little devils seem to always be able to find something. And then when the planet has been mined for all it has to offer, you can safely Seed it. I mean, you wouldn't want to do it the other way round, right, dig around with all the actual living creatures still on it? and you probably wouldn't want to risk them suddenly evolving to want to try it, too. Although let's face it, that particular chance is slim... the whole idea of a species given the gift of freedom and air and space suddenly deciding to all but ruin their world is ludicrous. Which is why we need Yellowites, by the way.\"\n\n\"That sounds like a good idea, actually. I'm sure in the two intervening Lengths I will finally muster the enthusiasm and the discipline to think of some fresh Seeding ideas. Thank you. You are such a good friend.\"\n\n\"No problem.

It was just me out here in the dark, behind me I could hear voices coming from inside the bar, they all sounded happy.\n\n It had been a year since everything in my life went to hell, I cursed all of those idiots in the bar beneath my breath. I lost my job, then just a week later I lost my house, and my family all left me at once, and as if that wasn't enough, I even lost my dog to aggressive cancer. How could the rest of the world be so happy when here I was, drunk and alone, they had left me.\n\nThe chilly night air slapped me across my face as I leaned against the dirty brick wall of the bar to keep my balance. The street was empty, with only a few rats scurrying around the overflowing trash bags on the street I was about to start the long stumble back to my crappy apartment when suddenly I heard movement behind me.\n\n\"It wasn't chance,\" a voice whispered into my ear it was so close I could feel the cold breath. \"I'm responsible for all of it...\"\n\nI spun around losing my balance and falling flat on the ground in the process and found myself looking up face to face with a stranger. He was tall and thin and looked like a rat in a man's body. The rat was wearing an expensive-looking suit with a golden watch on his left wrist. The man had a smile on his face that made my skin crawl, his eyes looked dull and lifeless, but the smile on his face stretched from ear to ear.\n\n\"What the heck are you talking about?\" I slurred, trying to get back on my feet. The man just looked at me and coldly offered his hand out to me to help me stand to my feet. \n\nThe man's smile widened as I stood up, and he spoke in a calm, almost amused tone. \"Your job, your house, your family... even poor old Rover. I arranged it all, every little misfortune that's happened to you this past year.\" He cackled, his laugh drowned out the low hums from the bar \"IT WAS ALL ME\" he said, arms outstretched as if he wanted my applause.\n\n\"What?\" I muttered\n\nThe man's emotions changed in an instant, the fake smiles were replaced by a face of utter sadness \"It broke my heart to put that cancer in Rovers head\" he mocked\n\nI felt my fists clench at my sides as rage boiled up inside me. \"You killed my dog?\" I kept repeating as I swung at him wildly, but he stepped back easily, and I stumbled forward, nearly falling on my face.\n\n\"Now, I have had enough,\" he chuckled as he paced around in a circle, but his eyes were still focused on my face. \"I didn't kill anyone. I simply arranged things. A word in the right ear here, a little nudge there. It was you who made the decision to put Rover down, all I did was give the doctor the script. It was you who did the rest. It's amazing how fragile people's lives are, how easily they can fall apart with just the slightest push.\"\n\nI managed to straighten up, I glared at him with all the hatred within me. \"Why? What the hell did I ever do to you? Why would you ruin my life like this?\"\n\nThe man shrugged, the stupid smile still not leaving his face. \"Nothing personal, I assure you. You were simply chosen. A test subject, if you will. We needed to see how much a human could endure before breaking, and you've proven to be quite resilient.\"\n\n\"We?\" I asked, trying to slowly creep closer and closer to this man. \"What do you mean, 'we'? Who the hell are you people?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he nodded, his smile growing even wider. \"There are more of us than you could imagine. We've been conducting these experiments for centuries. You humans are so fascinating, it's amazing how just one little domino can end all resilience in your futile life\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, maybe to gauge my reaction before he spoke again \"See, control is easy when a person is at their lowest. A king only has power when the people believe he does, so well simply put, you're our guinea pig. One of millions we watch to see how to create the perfect subject.\"\n\nI ignored him, I was finally close enough. I lunged at him with all the force I could muster, I hit him square in the jaw before I stumbled ahead of him. I turned back around with a grin on my face too, \"Yeah, how does your stupid grin feel about that? I asked\n\nThe man was holding his mouth, that stupid smile on his face was still there, just as wide as before. \"Ah, Jenson, you truly are a magnificent man. It really would be a shame to lose such a nice test subject\" he stopped for a moment, as if he was deep in thought \n\n\"Now that won't do at all,\" he touted, shaking his head like a disappointed owner.  \"I'm afraid we'll have to start over. Don't worry, you won't remember any of this. Good luck with your new life, Jenson. I do hope you're more cooperative this time.\"\n\nBefore I could say anything or try to attack him again, the world around me began to fade to black. I felt myself falling, but there was no impact, just freedom below me. I jolted awake from the darkness to find myself in bed. I was next to my wife Sophia. \n\nThe woman stirred beside me. \"Matthew? What's wrong, honey?\" she asked, her voice thick with sleep but filled with genuine concern. \n\n\"Nothing sweetie, I just had a little nightmare\" I said as I got back under the covers, cuddling closer to my wife.\n\n", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: After the worst year of your life.

{"id": "heuristic_text_generation_106", "raw_text": "You were hired to be the night guard for a supposedly haunted kid's pizzeria. Turns out the animatronics are really chill and like to hang out.", "requirements": ["Feel free to use creativity to expand on the prompt and create an interesting and captivating narrative.", "Ensure the story is no shorter than 8000 words."], "label": "The worst thing that ever came out of the invention of the shopping mall, Miguel figures, was the parking lots that came with them.\n\nIt's an ugly thing even in the daytime, the parking lot is: a baking sea of asphalt and curbs and reflector strips, a dead sea now that so much of the mall is closed. And even back before the pandemic, back when the mall was still alive, what would the lot have been like? Full to the brim with asshole drivers and clueless pedestrians and double-parkers. Teens reckless and bored playing chicken with lifted trucks trying to wedge themselves into compact spaces, tired kids chased by stressed and tired parents, pigeons hustling you for food scraps and shitting on your windscreens.\n\nBut it's still worse at night. At least in the day, there is sunlight and blue skies. There are people and cars, even if they are but a fraction of the crowds that used to throng the mall. And there are, if nothing else, still the pigeons. At night, there is nothing at all. Nothing but Miguel's car, the only car in the lot.. Nothing stirs except for the wind; nothing moves except for empty bags and scraps of trash.\n\nThere is nothing out there.\n\nAnd in the far beyond, opposite from where Miguel stands vaping in the entranceway to Becky's Pizza Bataganza, the tree-line that borders the lot from the highway is shrouded in black. It is nothing, too.\n\nEven in the daytime, the pizzeria wouldn't pay well. The management would still be cheap. But damn if Miguel doesn't wish - as he stands huddled under the neon lights of the entrance, filling his mouth with imitation mango vapor and shivering against the chill - he was working the day shift. At least then there'd be people around: management, customers, disappointed tourists. At least then the pizzeria would be alive...well, as alive as it ever got these days. At least then he might be allowed to actually stand inside the damn place.\n\nBut Becky's Bataganza didn't need another day guard. They needed a night guard.\n\nNo, they didn't even need a full night guard. They needed an 'exterior guard'. Just to patrol the perimeter, make sure no young hooligans or homeless people who wanted a warm place to sleep for the night could get in...or worse yet, the urban explorers. Becky's wasn't closed yet, not exactly, but management was convinced the carrion were already circling. Tacky kid-themed entertainment and creepy-looking animatronics were all the rage these days, after all. And after the unsolved murders, well...true crime was even more popular.\n\nOh no, management had promised Miguel he wouldn't ever need to patrol the inside: they weren't trying to hire him as security and then press him into maintenance and custodial roles! No, they had others for that. He'd just need to walk his rounds around the front and the back every so often, and then he'd be able to chill inside the mall in peace. Maybe read a book, listen to some podcasts.\n\nWould have been nice if they'd reminded the mall he needed a key.\n\nSo Miguel does his job to the best of his capabilities, because he's a professional: he walks from one side of the pizzeria's exterior to the other, from the mall's locked doors - and yep, still locked - to the neighboring storefront where a Spirit Halloween will be in a week, he scans the empty parking lot, he looks longingly to his car and thinks about a quick nap, then finally he sighs and another puff on the vape.\n\nFour more hours to go.\n\nBehind him, something looms on the other side of the doorframe. Something that thuds heavy against the safety glass, and speaks with metallic cheerfulness.\n\n\"Good to see you tonight -MIGUEL-! Your shift's already -ONE HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES- over!\"\n\nThe voice is high-pitched; bubbly; grating. It scrapes the inside of his ear and puts his hair on end. Even now, even now that he knows who it comes from, there is a primal feeling still churning up in his gut: the feeling of being in the presence of something that is not at all human...but pretending to be.\n\nThe first time he met her, he embarrassed himself. He'd resolved, as a professional, never to do so again. So instead of panicking, instead of backing away or hyperventilating, instead of running to his car and yelling, Miguel holds his vape tight in a trembling hand and slowly, coolly turns to face his coworker.\n\nOn the stage at a distance, the animatronic of Becky D Batsana could be seen as charming. On the other side of the glass, it's terrifying. The eyes are too big and too unblinking. The smile is too wide and too hinged. The animatronic as it is is just too damn close. It's easy to see, from here, how the rumors about them got started. Even if there was no proof.\n\nMiguel calmly freaks out.\n\n\"...Th-thanks for the head's...uh, head's up. So-something wrong....in there?\"\n\nHinges creak. Joints whir. False skin crinkles. Her voice again, infused with generative offness, pre-recorded phrases mixing freely with lines that could never have been on her script. \"-EVERYTHING'S BONANZA IN THE BATAGANZA!- as usual. I'm checking in with you of course! You've just been standing out there all night. Not going to come in?\"\n\nMiguel nods as he slowly, casually steps away from the door - and the animatronic behind it. \"...just keeping watch, Becky. I'm only scheduled for the exterior, remember?\" She might have said otherwise during their first meeting, but he's fairly certain she outranks him. He hopes this isn't some remnant of corporate programming starting up a secret test.\n\nBecky's sigh sounds more like a droning hum. Her face crinkles in simulated dejection. \"Again? When's your first internal shift?\"\n\nHe's already been at this job too long; Miguel can swear he hears a tone of actual emotion in the question.\n\n\"Afraid that's your job, not mine....though, uh, what do you actually do in there?\"\n\nHis coworker is still an affront to both engineering and programming, but the conversation that follows is at least a reprieve from the eerie boredom of his shift. Becky's all too happy to talk about the pizzeria's night mode, which appears much more comfortable than standing outside a dead mall for six hours. She talks about her bandmates - Sam 'Six-Hand' Scarabi, Wolfmoon Jack and the rest of the Bataganza Bunch - the radio stations they've tuned into to improve the naturalness of their voices, the hidden mementos they've kept to remind themselves of the pizzeria's better days. And in turn, she asks Miguel about the outside world, about everything and anything he can tell her about.\n\nIt's not a bad way to pass the time. In fact, it's about another hour into Miguel's shift before something pauses it.\n\nBecky's halfway through telling a story about the last birthday party she hosted when her head suddenly snaps upward. Her false ears - the ones concealing camera sensors - whir and focus on something in the far distance.\n\nMiguel realizes he has not faced the parking lot for some time.\n\n\"-MIGUEL-\". The animatronic's voice is flat, a pure robotic monotone...or is it? Is there a warning tone, somewhere in there? \"There is someone waving at you.\"\n\nMiguel turns, and sees someone at the far end of the lot.\n\nThey stand just at the tree-line bordering the lot, like they'd just emerged from it. They're certainly dressed for the outdoors, at least: a thick green jacket, blue jeans, hiking boots. A baseball cap. They wave over in the direction of the mall...in the direction of Miguel.\n\nCautiously, he waves back. Just as cautiously, he brings his free hand to his hip. Slowly, he feels for his stun gun.\n\nOkay, Miguel. Who is this person? There's no car in the lot: not a customer. They came from the treeline: had to have come from the highway. Homeless? Car crash?\n\n\"Hey!\" he yells out, in as authoritative a tone as he can muster. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nThe stranger stops waving, and just...stops. They look at Miguel, hands dangling at their sides, seeming to sway slightly. Disoriented? Confused?\n\n\"Are you okay? Do you need help?\"\n\n\"-MIGUEL-. I don't think you should speak to them.\"\n\nThe stranger tilts their head as if in confusion.\n\nAnd then they nod once. Twice. Three times. Four. More and more, until they are practically shaking from the force of their violent nodding. And then they stop once more, trembling in place, before they crouch...and wiggle. Miguel's hand clenches around the hilt of the stun gun, sets it to on. Something's not right. Something's not right at all.\n\nHis heart jumps in his chest at Becky's sudden words: \"-MIGUEL-. They're running.\"\n\nYes. The stranger isn't wiggling - they're running. Running not at all like how a human should run, running low on hands and feet in a sinuous bounding gait that is half-stride, half-gallop across the empty lot. Fast, too fast, oh god. And now they give response to Miguel's question, a broken record in mimicry of Miguel's own voice: \"-okayhellookayohelphelphelhellokayokay-\"\n\nThe stun gun's hot in his hand and the glass is tight against his back and he can't get in and he's trapped out here oh god please no no and-\n\n-and the door is open, and Miguel tumbles backwards onto the floor with a cry. His arm blocks his fall with a jolting pain and the stun gun flies free, only to be kicked aside by Becky. She steps over him with casual ease, raising the metal rod-bones of her false wings like a ring of thorns, mouth opening to unveil a beam of blinding light. Her voicebox hisses with intense static, then blares in pre-recorded warning.\n\n\"-YOU ARE UNAUTHORIZED TO ENTER THE PREMISES. CONTINUED LOITERING WILL-\"\n\nThe person that is not a person crashes into her with a howling laugh, impaling itself on the rods. Its hands scrabble and grasp at the outer shell, ripping and tearing anything they can. Becky, with a static screech and a brute force that cannot possibly come from an animatronic, slams its head into the wall. The stranger lunges upwards and bites deep through one of her false-eyes; she, in response, smashes it to the floor.\n\n\"-BATAGANZA ENTERPRISES IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY-\"\n\nMiguel rolls off his arm with a groan and gasps for air. Through the pain and the awful noises coming from the brawl, he can just about make out the fallen shape of the stun gun. He stretches his remaining good arm - it's just out of reach, but perhaps he can just...about...reach...and...\n\n\"-AND NOW THAT SPIEL'S OVER I'M GOING TO MAKE IT PERSONAL YOU MURDEROUS-\"\n\nHe has the gun. He has the gun! His thumb searches desperately for the activation switch, finds it, thumbs it, and...\n\nWith a professional scream borne from adrenaline, panic and rage, Miguel swings out towards the stranger and jabs it as deep as he can into its ankle. And then he swings again, and again, and again.\n\n...\n\nMiguel sits propped up against the entranceway podium, trying to get his breath back.\n\nEverything hurts. His arm hurts, his chest hurts, his legs hurt, his head hurts. But it's a good hurt, in a way. If he's in pain, he's not dead.\n\nThat said, he will probably be fired.\n\nThe body of the stranger, or what's left of it, lies unmoving on the asphalt outside. Underneath the skin, it looks nothing like a human. The trail Becky left behind after moving it has already started to crumble into rich, loamy dirt: before dawn, she has promised, it will all be vacuumed away.\n\nAnd the animatronic herself is coming back from the kitchen, freshly washed up and a box of cold pizza in hand. She carefully places it by him, then stands by the podium to look outside. It's still dark out there. And there is nothing out there again, aside from a solitary car and the body of something that came from the trees and walked like a man.\n\nShe stands in silence while Miguel wolfs down the stalest, oiliest, most delicious pizza he has ever had in his life. Only when he puts a half-eaten slice back into the box does she turn back to look at him...although the cameras remain fixed on the exterior. Her voice is soft - and less bubbly than before.\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\nA grimace. A wince. \"I will be. Thanks for...you know. All that.\"\n\n\"I've seen it before.\"\n\nMiguel has no idea what to say to that.\n\nBecky takes his silence for assent to continue. \"Sometimes the hat was different. Or the jacket. I should have recognized it earlier. But I would see it, and then later when others would come here at night it would follow them and...\" It should be impossible for that generative voice to trail off so naturally, and yet somehow it does. \"...Bataganza Enterprises had always set us to internal mode. Nobody was near the door before.\"\n\nAnd there is nothing Miguel can possibly say to that. So instead he settles for \"Oh.\" He rests his head back against the podium. It's a hell of a reveal.\n\n\"It's why I wanted you to come inside! Not just to meet the band.\" Slowly, the bubbly tone creeps back in. She continues, \"But of course, you were a professional! That's top marks from me when I give my report to the company, and my word major weight here.\"\n\nAt the mention of the company, Miguel sighs. \"Thanks, Becky. Hope the security footage will be as kind.\"\n\n\"It won't show anything out of the ordinary. Wolfmoon Jack knows how to splice an edit\". At this, Becky gives another of her creepy fake winks. \"You had a completely normal evening! Patrolling, keeping watch, completely boring. Nothing happened, you never came inside, and there was no body.\"\n\nMiguel can't help from glancing outside. The body is becoming less of a body, even now: mouldering to dirt and leaves and twings. But there are still bones: long, thin, dry and bleached. Not human. Not at all.\n\n\"What was that thing?\"\n\nBecky's response is cheerful: \"I have no idea, -MIGUEL-. No idea at all. But you're alive...and it's dead.\"\n\nHer camera lenses swivel to face him properly, eye to virtual eye. \"Three hours left in your shift, and there's not a thing out there.

Grief unlike any a human has ever experienced.\n\nI was something of an oddity, a loner. The need for social contact that defined so much of our species and 'the human experience' very simply did not apply to me. I could go for months without speaking a word to anyone, not even needing so much as a text conversation. It was this trait that led me to volunteer for the mission. There were several other candidates in the running, people whose psychological profiles were less of a good fit, but whose thirst to live on throughout history was stronger than mine. One by one, my competitors were eliminated. Until there was just me. I was going to be the first human to arrive in the orbit of another star.\n\nI was given longevity treatments, the most cutting edge ones our science could muster. My ship had a massive laser sail that would be pushed up to speed by laser, then shed from the vehicle. I would travel across interstellar space, and arrive at Proxima Centauri. An antimatter rocket would be ignited, and I would decelerate until I was in a stable orbit. From there, I would oversee robots as they harvested asteroids and built structures needed to host humans and the lasers to decelerate future packages that would be sent there.\n\nI was trained in the processes I would need to carry out, the psychology technicians still probing my mind, looking for anything that could become a threat to the mission once I was underway. Even up to launch day, they saw such a psychological break as the greatest risk in the mission. But soon I was strapped in a rocket, and delivered to the craft that had been assembled in orbit of Luna.\n\nThe acceleration from the laser array was gentle but constant. Modifications would make my body less prone to degradation in microgravity, but I would still have to follow an extensive exercise regimen, as well as take a lot of pills and treatments to maintain my physique.\n\nI was about four years into the journey when it happened. The uplink home was disrupted, and the acceleration I could feel from the laser array stopped at about the same time. I ran through the possibilities. A terror attack? An accident. The main uplink was gone, but the back up antenna was still functional.\n\nThere was silence for minutes, because I was so far from home, but then a burst of chatter. Something terrible had happened, and the survivors were not clear as to what it was. While I listened, I saw it. A flash so bright it dazzled me, even though I was already far from home. I realized whatever had happened, it had silenced a large portion of the panicked radio chatter.\n\nI considered reaching for the transmitter, joining the confusion, searching for answers. As I pondered, I saw more, smaller flashes. Each burst of light seemed to coincide with the silencing of one of the voices. I put two and two together, and I knew horror.\n\nIt had been an outstanding question. Why did humanity see no evidence of alien life reshaping the cosmos? There were a multitude of different suggestions for why it was so. \"We are the first!\" \"We simply aren't advanced enough to see the signs.\" \"Technological civilization is simply very rare.\"\n\nBut there was one that always gave me chills, \"There is something that murders fledgling civilizations before they can spread across the stars.\" It was dawning on me that this is what was happening. Something terrible had heard our voices, transmitted too loudly through space. And it had found us.\n\nTransmissions slowed down. Each source had given its location away, and they appeared to be being systematically destroyed. Until there was silence. Was I the last? Were there others who had been wise enough to remain silent?\n\nThe days went by. I came to believe I really was alone. I wept for hours. I may not have been social, but I still cared about people. I had empathy, I wanted other people to have good lives. My family was dead. Everyone's family was dead. Everything we had ever built was dead. Every work of art, every scientific achievement. All except the fragments of those things I had with me. I considered sending my own message, a communication barrage as loud as I could, one final scream against the monsters in the night. But if I did that, they would find me, and I would be vaporized. Even this tiny trace of what we had been would be obliterated. I didn't want that, I wanted to hope that some other species would find my ship, find the vestiges of what humanity was and could have become.\n\nThe ship came with suicide pills, in the event something went terribly wrong. I argued with myself, reasons not to take them and reasons to do so. The ship was designed to work for over a century, all necessary maintenance being conducted by me. I would never reach Proxima Centauri. The laser array was gone, the antimatter rocket would definitely be picked up by the things that had slaughtered everyone else. I saw no point to living, anymore. But still, I wanted to do something with myself before making an exit.\n\nSo I wrote. About our history, about what we had been, about what we were becoming before being shattered. Our flaws, our virtues. Our achievements, our sins. I wanted to give some hypothetical alien that found my ship as much as I could about the good things we had been, the good things we could have become. Awash in a sea of emotions, I channeled my capacity for artistic expression. I reached a milestone in my work, having gotten it to a point that felt like completion. Bathed in that glow of unimaginable grief and the sensation of fulfillment, I laid down and swallowed the euthanasia pills.\n\nIn my final moments, I whispered the words, \"Goodbye, beautiful.\"\n", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: Under what circumstances does the last human die?\n[Requirements]:\n1.

I was closest with my dad but he was at work most of the time so I was alone, throughout the day I would work on shapes and puzzles then go out for walks and bike rides around the neighbourhood.\n\nI had a few freinds one really adaptive and creative called Sam, and another ridiculously good at math and puzzles, I couldn't understand Jeremy but it was cool to have a smart freind nonetheless. My name is Tim even though I'm pretty boring compared to my two freinds, I always thought there might be something I was good at. I just haven't found it yet. Sigh... I often just didn't care about where the papers went after I threw them, I thought as long as they go over the fence or hedges I could leave it at that. I was much to interested in riding, the thrill of propulsion and to gowhatever speed I wanted down those roads was one of the best things about working the paper routes.\n\nNow though after three and a half years, I found myself a little bored with the experience. The same places, the same roads again and again. I know it's selfish to want to move but, my parents own the same house they have always lived in and my freinds have moved school once or twice so I had to make new ones.\n\nI'm thinking about my future on a route after just having made some octahedron shapes, maybe I can get an art scholarship. That thought leaves me on high alert as I chuck papers over the wet fences and front walls of people's homes. Then I notice something weird, I mean, it seemed inconspicuous at first, I just threw a paper over another bush and saw it go over the side, but it happened too quick. I'm used to watching it go over so I can usually track it as it goes but this time it just disappears. I think for a second and just decide that it must have hit something and fell down, or it could have been a Web, some spiders can string pretty strong ones so I wasn't too surprised. But I decided I was curious enough so I threw another over and watched as it wobbled through the air. This time it looked to have sputtered, stopping for a short blink before being completely gone. At this point I was feeling a little offput, like something must be wrong with me. I couldn't have seen it disappear and that frightened me because I may be having hallucinations. Mother always talked about psychology and said how dangerous it was to ignore. I would go home, if the same happened again tommorow then I would start worrying or believing in witchcraft.\n\nWhen I got home I was greeted by Mother as she was making breakfast, a traditional meal but nonetheless good for you. Father was at work already and I wasn't sure about asking about stuff right then. So I sat and ate breakfast.\n\nThe next day I asked whether my mom believed in superstition and things like that, magic etc. She said no, but she also gave me a look and told me. It's ok to believe In things when your a kid because it makes you more healthy. I was sceptical and still am but scince I couldn't deny what I saw, I guess it was ok for now. Later in the day I walked to that house, to that bush and threw something in, one of my science magazines. It disappeared and I got a chill down my spine, I knew it was ok but, I had never thought it would still be like that. This time I rushed home in panic Intending to tell my parents what I thought I saw. But knew I was probably headed for the hospital, they wouldn't think it was explainable. But as soon as I got home I was greeted by my two parents, they were home from work with an odd look on their faces, they said I had someone on the phone for me. Me. ? Maybe it was one of my freinds.\n\nI picked it up and said hello, in an uncertain voice. What I heard next was not possible. This is President Nixon, I know your just a kid but this is important son, if you believe in America, even the world, then you will come to meet me soon. I have agents coming to you in ten minutes, don't worry your not in trouble. You can bring your parents if you like, but this is a national emergency and you might be the only person who can help.\n\nBy the end of the message I was in pure shock, mostly I thought it might be a joke, but that kind of sounded like Nixon from the moon landing on TV. I was eying my parents now in shock, and kind of a sense of horror. I could see they were distraught. They were trying to hide it but this seemed as much a surprise to them as me. In the silence after the ring I felt sick, kind of tired and feeling a sense of awe. I put down the phone onto the wall and tried to block the ringing from my mind and from the phone.\n\nFather was looking a little odd now, pale and obviously more convinced by my face. He said it's ok, I'm sure it'll be ok. The government just wants to ask you something, they'll leave once you explain the truth. Whatever that is, son.\n\nThe next few minutes felt like the longest I ever had. But I knew, as to comfort myself, that I was something special, I must have something they want right? Although I can't think of it except that weirdly disappearing paper. Mom put on teas for us assuming they would want as well, she seemed to be in shock to because she didn't move much in the time we sat drinking our tea. I thought it might all be a delusion, a dream or something but at 12 minutes people knocked on the door, then seemed to open it without a key. They said hello and introduced themselves. They were security, not anyone who would speak, but they tried to purvey calm to the group so I felt A little better.\n\nThe next man to come in was a general of some kind, general Riviera Gretel he announced himself taking off a hat and bowing slightly with a very plain face.\n\nThere was silence all around as we became accustomed to whatever was happening. He said do you like our country son? Yess' I said. Good, well do you know why I might be here, maybe something was different lately?\n\n\"Look I can't think of much to tell you, there was something that happened in one of the yards on my paper route but, I really don't know what to believe.\"\n\nRiviera \"that's ok you don't need to worry, but what did you see, and where. Please try to tell us as close the the truth of what happened as you can? Ok.\" Smiles and nods.\n\nWell i saw some stuff just go away while in mid-air at this place called 15 limestone ave.\n\n\"That's good, thanks for telling us that, do you believe what you saw?\"\n\nI well, no not really, I made a m mistake. Didn't I?\n\n\"Don't worry about that, now we will take a look for our government, just to keep everyone, safe. We might want to talk to you again though. Is that OK?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\nThen they left. What the hell was that? It can't be real, what are they even investigating? Magic acts?\n\nAgents outside 45th Thompson St.\n\n\"The boy told us where we need to look?\" Detail-driver. General \"Yes, 15 limestone ave, take us there and get a team of scientists and police detail for the outside of that area. Were going to evacuate that street quietly.

It was his first official day on the job and he was trying to make some light conversation, and maybe even a friend. Reaching that point took a lot of work, the security detail was the most top-secret unit in the world as far as Perry could tell. Of the ones he knew about, anyway. He'd been well into the career track when he first heard about it, and it still took some time to land him here. He wasn't a young man by any definition anymore, but he had all the right experience. It was a position that valued wisdom and quick thinking more than physicality. And, he was rather surprised at how lax everything was once he reached the highest level of secrecy.\n\nPerry, and the other guard who hadn't formally introduced himself yet, stood in a white room guarding a large black, bank vault-style door. They were the 'inside' guards, there was another set just outside the white room; but, he had no idea what was beyond the black vault door.\n\n\"I'm plenty talkative, rookie,\" the other guard shook his head with a shrug. \"Considering where we are, that's not a conversation we should be having,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" Perry asked. He was happy the man answered at all. He suddenly had a positive feeling about the night ahead. \"C'mon, it's the perfect place for this conversation,\" he made the effort of gesturing at the vault with this thumb. \"You've never wondered? Not even once?\"\n\n\"No,\" the stern guard shook his head. \"You seem nice, so I'll say this much... if you're asking, you obviously missed a very important part of training. I don't know if you dozed off or what, but, let's finish this shift in silence, and I recommend you go talk to a trainer as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"Huh?\" Perry wasn't sure what to make of it. But, his hope got the better of him as two key points jumped out. His new friend said he didn't wonder, that had to be a lie. It was human nature to be curious, it only made sense they would speculate. Unless, it was tied to his follow-up advice. Why did he need to talk to a trainer? Did he miss the explanation of what was in the vault? He did catch himself half-sleeping through a couple of late-night sessions, but they didn't seem that important and he aced all the tests along the way. \"Wait, you know what's in there!??\" he asked.\n\n\"Whoa, stop right there,' the other guard shook his head and put his palms up to try and calm Perry down. \"This discussion is over now. I'm urging you to stay quiet for the rest of the shift,\" he said. He waited for a brief eternity and his features softened. \"Please...,\" he said. He was younger than Perry, but not by much. It was part of the reason Perry thought they'd get along. But, he was starting to realize that maybe the guard didn't want to get along with him.\n\n\"You're right, I'm sorry. I'll keep quiet,\" Perry nodded. It was a shame; but, he was too old to worry about why someone decided they didn't like him. The next words out of his mouth were meant as a joke. Despite the situation, Perry always found it helpful to try and lighten the mood when facing a tense encounter.\n\n\"But, when I do find out what's behind the door, I'm not telling you,\" Perry chuckled. Then, an alarm blared in the room.\n\n\"MY FIRST NIGHT!? COME ON!!\" Perry readied his weapon as he spun around looking for someone to aim at; and, he was surprised to see his unnamed partner walking toward one side of the room.\n\n\"Perry Clarkson...,\" a new, deeper voice spoke up as white dust gathered in the center of the room. He aimed his gun at it as the particles coalesced and took shape. In seconds the older guard found himself looking at a large CRT TV resting on a golden A/V cart. The TV was on displaying a golden, faceless mannequin in a red suit. \"You have engaged in speculation regarding the contents of the vault. Your position is to be terminated, report to Human Resources to surrender your node.\"\n\n\"You're kidding.....,\" it was a weak reply, Perry was still coming to terms with what the TV said. \"You can't fire me for speculation! It's normal human nature!\" he said.\n\n\"It is normal human nature,\" the character nodded. \"But, this is Sharp Development. We don't settle for 'normal' here, we have standards. Standards that you do not measure up to,\" the TV said. \"And, we most certainly can dismiss you for speculation, it's a notable clause in the contract.\"\n\n\"This is a joke, right!? It's my first night, you guys are playing a trick!\" Perry had worked too hard to get there and his mind refused to accept it.\n\n\"What difference does it make what we talk about?? I don't KNOW what's in there, it's all just guessing. None of us knows!\"\n\n\"Guessing is precisely the danger,\" the mannequin replied. \"For the sake of example, take the concept of something ethereal, like an idea. Let's pretend there's an idea locked behind that door. If you guess right, the idea is out and the door is useless. There is power in words, power in speculation. Now, please leave, or I'll have Jerry shoot you,\" the mannequin gestured at the only other person in the room, and his gun was already aimed at Perry.\"\n\n\"Sorry man, I tried to get you to shut up.\"\n", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: They didn't know what exactly they were guarding in the secret bunker, only that it was top secret and really dangerous.

Using three hands to climb and hold a stable position without slipping or shaking and with my other two hands pulled out the appropiate tool, dig into my material bags for the needed resource, and using my last hand to hold the book for me to double check the instructions.\n\nI pulled out a handfull of seeds and with the phase hammer smashed a grouping of seeds into the surface of the stone ledge in a number given by the book. I then waited a few seconds watching as the sprouted making bright yellow roots downward toward the ground before sprouting a few miniscule flowers on the place they were planted. 'With many thick interweaving roots to gather light, water, and nutrients to sustain themselves, they are best used to signal upward as the roots grow downward in a way that is inviting to climb them.' The book as always was correct I was almost tempted to try climg up them, but did not do so as my weight would probably cause them to snap.\n\nAfter the first ledge was fully covered in the roots, I moved up and slightly to the side toward the next ledge which required a touch up. Carefully using the climbing gloves against the rocky surface making sure that I do not leave any traces by using too much force which could accidentally tear away the focus from the path. I again lock myself into a steady place and position and this time make a more spread out pairing with the seeds to make it unique. And I continue doing so until every marked spot was changed and covered in the roots.\n\nBack on the ground I look at my work, it was a sideways staircase of bright roots almost glowing under the light and while fitting into the area was certainly a good way to give the knowledge that it was where to go next and that you could climb up. One of my finest works yet if I had to say so. I pocketed the tool, materials, and book and quickly transported myself from this area to the next place in need of work marked on the map by my colleagues. I know that it would do its job in helping people find their way and how happy and joyful they will be doing so.\n\nThe Hero of the realms was walking, standing high and proud in their shining armor. Jumping from the various platforms protruding from the stone wall in a few hops, and quickly killing the enemies standing and waiting for the Hero on them. And after a few seconds the Hero reaches a dead end with their walked path behind them. a steep fall before them, and beside them a stone railing, and most eyecatching a wall with bright roots shining in the light of the setting sun.\n\nThe Hero stood on the spot spinning weirdly in silence until they spoke. \"Chat, where the hell am I suppose to go?\" They stared over the edge with certain death awaiting them below. \"Down there? That should be death though right?\" They crouched down attempting to look more closely at the ground deep below. \"Thanks for the bits guys.\" The Hero jumped in the direction of the railing trying to get ontop of them but failing to clear it as they moved against it.\n\nThe Hero then moved backwards from the railing looking at the path they came from with their back against the roots of the wall. \"Did I miss some switch or something?\" They jumped back onto the platforms they had cleared of enemies before looking for a non-existant switch or button. They finally turned and looked in the direction of the wall again, before turning their gaze away once more. \"What do you mean blind streamer? There is no mechanism or whatever here.\" They proclaimed again spinning in circles and looking around again, each time the wall with bright roots in their view.\n\nThey moved back to the apparent dead end and again attempted to jump onto the railing again. \"Turn around?\" The Hero faced the wall and only the wall standing far too close to the wall to see the roots barely out of their view. \"That's a wall, great.\" They walked into the wall for a short moment before stopping. \"Fuck it, I'm looking it up.\" The Hero stood there for a few minutes, standing completely still with their gaze directed at the stone surface, which if it could would move against the presence exuded by the Hero. \"Fucking vines? Where the hell?\" They suddenly moved back again spinning before locking onto the roots which they looked up and down, before silently climbing up. \"Fucking game and its terrible marked paths.\"\n", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: You are the person who travels across the lands, painting every climbable surface and edge for the main character to use.\n[Requirements]:\n1.

A white man the other week? An Asian man the other week behind that other week? Well, you get the idea...\"\n\nI was stunned. Utterly and woefully stunned.

That I operate with His tacit approval, because otherwise He would have stopped me years ago. The Ultronian is a god on this planet, after all. But he and I both know the truth. There is nothing the extra-terrestrial can do to me now. Maybe decades ago, but I am far beyond his reach now.\n\nThe Ultronian is yelling at The Fox, begging him to explain himself. The Flying Fox stands there silent, his trademark grimace unflinching as a being with the power of 6 trillion A-bombs screams in his face. When The Fox sees me, the grimace turns to a smile.\n\nThe Ultronian is in front of me in an instant.\n\n\"You can't do this,\" the alien said, but my eyes are already locked with The Fox's. I walk forward, through The Ultronian, passing as if he doesn't exist. In this moment, he might as well not. I don't have to hear The Flying Fox out, but I am curious about the nature of the trap. There has to be one. The Ultronian's hand claps on my shoulder, and I feel his immense power as he tries to control my movement. That alone makes me seethe. I try to breathe through the anger, and my feet slip a little below me. I look down and the ground is slick with blood, the gore not yet still enough to have congealed into a tacky goop.\n\nI flinch at the sight, my curly red hair flicking the Ultronian in the face, flinging him away into the sky as if he'd never existed. That won't have killed him, but he is gone for now. I return my gaze to The Flying Fox, whose smile has grown wider. Is he being mind-controlled? The grin is the trademark of his nemesis.\n\n\"It's all me in here,\" he growls, anticipating my line of thinking. That is one of his gifts. He is always moves ahead.\n\n\"So what's the game here Fox,\" I ask, stepping out of the pooling blood and closer to him. \"If this is a trap, just spring it already.\"\n\n\"The Orphan,\" he replies in his raspy monotone. \"Real name Annie Gray. Lost her parents at seven during a clash between the Sandwich Man and the Sensational Six. Known to be responsible for 86 hero deaths. Impervious to harm, powered by spite, The Orphan kills any superbeing responsible for collateral damage resulting in the loss of life of an innocent. Trademark: A simple throat rip.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I've read my wikipedia entry,\" I reply flatly. I take another step forward. One more and I'll be in 'throat rip' range.\n\n\"You're the ultimate protector of those who cannot protect themselves,\" The Flying Fox continues, as if I hadn't spoken. \"Dealing out \"justice\" as you see fit to any and all metahumans who deserve it. Both good and bad.\"\n\n\"If your plan is to lull me to sleep with monotonous exposition, I should warn you that I don't need to sleep any more.\" I take another step forward, and I lift my arm up to demonstrate my relative range.\n\n\"If you only kill metahumans,\" The Flying Fox says, a tinge of nervousness rippling through the gravel. \"I should warn you that I am not one.\"\n\nMy hand drops back down again. Surprise washes over The Fox's face for a moment. That can't be the plan though. \"I... you can't be serious. I don't exclusively kill metas. You can't have thought I'd let you live just because you don't have powers.\"\n\nThe Flying Fox's grin skews to one side. \"No, I didn't. But I wanted to see your reaction.\"\n\nMy eye twitches and I feel my power grow. \"Alright, well, it's weird for you to do this when you could have just asked, but I appreciate the commitment to the bit.\" I lift my arm towards him, and he... steps back.\n\n\"Wait,\" The Fox says quickly. \"You don't care how I keep up with the metas despite having no powers?\"\n\n\"You're rich,\" I say, shaking my head at the rhetoric. \"Your teeth are a dead giveaway. Every time you open your mouth, everyone knows you're rich beyond measure. If you try to bribe me, I am going to make yet another exception, and before I kill you I will hurt you.\"\n\n\"I am. I am rich. And do you know where my money goes?\"\n\n\"Dental work and fetish wear.\"\n\n\"Orphanages.\"\n\nI let my arm fall again, and I exhale deeply. \"Ok, go on.\" I say. Damn my insatiable curiosity.\n\n\"I, like you, grew up without parents,\" The Fox says. \"Grew up an orphan. Except I grew up wanting for nothing. You... I know you had the hard-knock life. I have used my incredible wealth to fund orphanages around the world. The children who wind up at them want for nothing. There have been cases where parents have deliberately gotten themselves killed in meta conflicts so that their children might wind up at one of my boarding schools.\"\n\nI put the details together in a heartbeat. \"You're... you're Oliver Warbucks?\" My jaw slackens.\n\n\"I am,\" says a voice, no longer the rasping growl of The Flying Fox but the rich, heartwarming timbre of the man they call \"The World's Daddy\". I stumble back a step in shock. \"You and I are a lot alike,\" he continues. \"We both see the impact metahumans have on this world. We both know that something must be done to safeguard against them.\"\n\n\"Why...\" I stutter. \"Why would you do this?\"\n\n\"To show you that there must be a different way,\" he replies, his voice warm and soft and soothing. Listening to him is like being wrapped in a bear hug and squeezed full of love. I take another step back. My heel sticks to the asphalt for a second and I glance down. The blood from the woman has started to dry, and I remember why I'm here.\n\n\"There isn't.\" I snarl in reply, and I step towards him again.\n\nHis head tilts. \"But there's more yet you don't know,\" he says. There is no The Flying Fox any more, just Oliver Warbucks, the philanthropist who owns orphanages around the world. The man who saves young children and sees that they lead the lives of their dreams.\n\n\"Spit it out Warbucks,\" I say as I reach ripping distance again.\n\n\"If you kill me, every single one of my orphanages will be dissolved. Dismantled. Destroyed. I had my will amended, witnessed and notarised. If you kill me, those children will be out on the street by nightfall tonight.\"\n\nThe power in me surges, a roaring torrent of rage. \"That's it? That's your plan? Newsflash, \"Daddy\", but amending your will to do something bananas and then walking outside and committing murder-suicide doesn't paint the picture of a sound mind.\"\n\n\"It's airtight, Annie,\" he says softly. \"The Will was amended 11 months ago. I've spent the last year passing mental health checks. This isn't something I did on a whim.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I spit back. \"So some kids get tricked instead of treated. They won't be the first, and they won't be the last. Why would that stop me from killing you?\"\n\n\"I suppose it mightn't,\" he said in his fatherly, compassionate voice, \"but it might make you admit to yourself that you kill for reasons beyond some higher pursuit of justice.\"\n\nI sigh. \"You couldn't find a tram for this half-baked trolley problem gambit?\" I sneer. \"Do you know how many collateral deaths there were before I existed? What about after? I'm not pulling a lever, you dumbass, I am the fucking trolley. Every time one of you heroes goes out and decides to stroke your own ego by beating up the mentally ill, I am the reason you're all careful not to hurt anyone else. I'm also the reason The Puffin King is content to bloodlessly escape the Hudson Street Asylum and why The Fool's guns all shoot flags that say bang. Did you really think I hadn't considered the philosophical circumstances of my existence? I told you I don't sleep.\"\n\nI step to the caped man and raise my hand to his throat, but in the blink of an eye another throat is in my grasp. The Ultronian is back. His face is bruised, and he looks deeply out of breath.\n\n\"Wait, Orphan,\" he says. My hand relaxes from his neck. \"You can't kill The Flying Fox.\"\n\n\"I can,\" I retort drily. \"I'll show you.\"\n\n\n\"No, you can't,\" the Ultronian says, his hands up, shaking. He is scared. Truly scared. \"You mustn't. Tomorrow the Nibiru arrives. A being greater than you or I or anything we can fathom. It exists beyond the limits of reason. Of our reason, anyway. But The Flying Fox can defeat it. I don't know how, I don't know why, but the Deus 10 machine was certain. The Flying Fox is the only thing that can stop the Nibiru. If he dies, humanity is doomed.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" I laugh. It is a mean, bitter chuckle. Everything with these people is for some moment that hasn't happened yet. For some time that might not ever be. \"Tomorrow? That will always be a day away. We live in the present, and we suffer our consequences in the here and now.\"\n\nBehind the three of us, the baby in the pram begins crying. It has been so quiet this whole time, but now it is awake and missing its mother. Would always miss its mother. It is time to finish this. The Ultronian's face skews in panic, and he throws a wild strike my way. It lands. The Ultronian can't stop me, but he is still a being of staggering power. I feel my ribs crack as the alien's fist drives into the side of my breast. The anger I feel at the audacity of the attack repairs me even as it destroys me, but the pain is still real. I black out for a brief second, and when I come too I am three miles in the air and climbing. The Ultronian is dragging me with him to space. I reach up and push the super being into the Andromeda Galaxy, phasing through his hand as I do. I can't fly, so I have to fall back to the ground.\n\nWhen I land 30 seconds later, The Flying Fox is cradling the baby in his arms. \"This baby will have a wonderful life, Annie,\" says Warbucks. \"But only if you let me live.\"\n\nI shake my head at him and I cross the space between us in a heartbeat. My hand grabs his throat.\n\n\"Wait Annie,\" he says, his warm voice strangled. \"You don't want to orphan this child do you?\"\n\nI hold him still, and I say nothing. \"She's mine, Annie. This baby had a mother, yes. And I loved her dearly. And 12 months ago, using my fortune, the greatest science known to man and a bit of luck, we conceived this beautiful little miracle. My own little girl.\"\n\nMy fury flares like a supernova. It takes everything in me to stop from tearing The Flying Fox apart atom by atom. \"You shot your own wife?!\"\n\n\"I had to,\" says Warbucks. He is weeping uncontrollably. \"Don't you understand? I had to. And now, if you kill me, you'll be orphaning this little girl. My little Annie.\"\n\n\"You...\" I am lost for words for a moment. \"You named her Annie?\"\n\n\"After you, of course. Of course I did. She's a tribute to you Annie. To one of the greatest heroes the world has ever known. What other name could she have?\"\n\nA bitter taste fills my mouth. \"Sentimentality? So that's your final play? Maybe The Orphan is a sentimental idiot?\"\n\n\"No,\" he says, stiffly shaking his head around my hand. \"Everything I said is sincere. I want you to understand that if you kill me, you will be orphaning this little girl. You kill metas that make orphans right? So if what I did was suicidal, then what you're about to do is suicidal too.\"\n\nI stare at him. It feels like hours pass. Beneath my hand, The Flying Fox gently rocks baby Annie back to sleep. He seems sincere. Genuine. Like a good man backed into a corner somehow. Forced to do the unthinkable. I think I understand how he feels.\n\n\"So be it,\" I say, and I rip his throat out like pulling a tissue from a box. I grab little orphan Annie as her father's corpse falls to the floor, and I place her back in her pram.\n\nAnd then I place my hand around my windpipe and pull.", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: You are \"The Orphan\", the only supervillain that is not outright hated.

Nah, I never bothered myself with targeting Monarchs. I prefered to keep things much more low key.\n\nMy town may have known my name, but I had the ability to remain anonymous everywhere else.\n\nMy \"villiany\" existed out of boredom. I targeted banks and city buildings. Stole enough to keep things interesting then left humorous clues to my identity.\n\nIt was harmless, no real victims just corporations and the occasional millionaire CEO.\n\nThe local social media groups seemed to get a kick out of my actions. Many were struggling with the control these corporations had over their lives. Someone taking subtle revenge seemed to spur them on, give them hope.\n\nI never hurt anyone. I never took from those who needed it. While the corporations saw me as a villian, many citizens saw me as somewhat of a Robin Hood.\n\nNo one was ever meant to get hurt.\n\nThen, they made me mad...\n\nYou should never give someone the title \"villan\" and make them mad!\n\nSome wise guy CEO decided he was sick and tired of my antics and he was going to put a stop to it. Get this... He doned a lyrica suit... Mask, Cape, underwear on the outside the whole works.

Don't give someone the title \"villian\" and make them mad.\n\nYou definitely don't call someone a \"villian\" and kidnap their children. Their life blood.\n\nI didn't need any fancy costume; jeans, a polo shirt and my New Balance sneakers had always worked for me.\n\nOne thing about fancy costumes. They don't hide finger prints. I was smart enough to wear gloves during my crimes. While it took months for the public to uncover my identity, it took me just a few hours to uncover the identity of the foolishly dressed avenger.\n\nIt was a foolish young CEO, a self-proclaimed Alpha type. He'd talked a lot of smoke about his top notch security sytsem and team. I mean, they weren't that top notch. I'd emptied his Headquarters, safety deposit box and home within hours. I walked straight past the top notch security team and not a single camera or alarm system caught me.\n\nI'd laughed when he'd sworn revenge. I guess that was my downfall, I got arrogant. Thought I was invincible. And I was.\n\nMy family however, weren't. I should have prepared them, taught them to defend themselves. At least thought realistically about the risks to my family.\n\nInstead my arrogance put my family in harm's way.\n\nSo my family had been kidnapped and I had no idea what this crazed fool in lyrca was going to do to them. I wasn't waiting around to find out.\n\nAs a rule I didn't cause harm, I only targeted billionaire corporations and their overpaid CEOs.\n\nBut this lycra wearing fool threw the rule book out the window. I would do whatever needed to ensure my family's safety.\n\nMy crimes had been successful due to me possessing a special set of skills. Skills that gave me the ability to manuever through facilities completely undetected. It had only been through an arrogant mistake had my identity ever been revealed in the first place. Arrogance was a dangerous flaw to possess and the downfall of many great men.\n\nMy New Balance sneakers gave me the power I needed to kick down the Lyrca'd Fool's front door.\n\n\"Took you long enough!\" The fool laughed as the dust cleared from the fallen door.\n\n\"It took you 6 years to find me. I found you in less than 6 hours. If you really want to talk about who took long enough... Where are they?\"\n\nI searched the room before he even had a chance to respond. I knew they wouldn't be in the front room, but I'd hoped to find some sort of false door or something. There had been nothing. I'd search the rest of the house when he took his next breath,\n\n\"Revenge is best delivered when its least expected,\"\n\n\"I disagree. My best revenge is going to be exactly when you expect it. Where are my family?\" There was a split second glance towards the stairs and I was gone.\n\nA secret door in the furthest room. The fool would realise I was gone soon. My speed allowed me quite the advantage.\n\nThe secret door was built with reinforced steel. As if that could keep me out. Slow me down, yes, but keep me out? Never!\n\nI heard the fool's footsteps at the top of the stairs as I threw my body against the door one last time. The hinges creaked then gave way opening to a dark unfinished room.\n\n\"DADDY!\" My five year old screamed, \"I'm scared,\" he muttered as he buried into my chest, \"Hi Scared, I'm Dad!\" I smirked, my wife smacked my arm as my son groaned at the joke.\n\n\"We don't have much time! Put these on. One each!\" I pulled off my New Balance sneakers and handed them to my family.\n\n\"They'll keep you safe,\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"They're magic!\" I whispered to my son.\n\n\"Now, put them on and go. Take the car, it's already packed.

Now go!!\" I shoved my family out of the secret room and towards the stairs, \"RUN! Don't stop!\"\n\nI watched my wife and young son disappear out of the room as the fool got closer. They would pass him without him seeing and be gone from the property before he finally reached the secret room.\n\nI pulled a new pair of New Balance out of my backpack and crouched to tie them. I heard laughter at the door and turned to see the fool had finally made it.\n\n\"You're exactly where I want you!\" He laughed, grabbing the heavy door and beginning to push it closed. I stepped out of the room, pushed him in and slammed the door closed.\n\nLeaning against the closed door, I checked the tracker, my family were nearly 10 miles out of town.

The midwife was called to their manor to deliver him. His mother was convinced that her home was cleanlier than any hospital could ever be. There were complications, but she refused to leave. Eventually, Homer was born a normal healthy baby.\n\nHis upbringing was quite bizarre. Their house was located by a public beach, and Homer begged his parents to spend the day there. He wanted to splash in the waves and catalogue shells similar to most adolescents. His parents forbid him for different reasons.\n\nHis mother often confided in him about the dangers and germs present in the outside world. The interior of her manor was under her control, and she held onto it by a thread. She spent most of the time in her bedroom that she didn't share with her husband. Homer and his father were required to shower within the past hour before entering. The woman never went to the front door. All chores were done by servants.\n\nSuch lifestyle could only be supported by wealth. Homer's paternal and maternal ancestors had it for as back as the line could be traced. His father was a keen investor ensuring that they would stay wealthy for the next several generations. With such wealth, it was simple to gaze upon the matches and convince oneself of grandeur. Homer's father told him that the public beach was where uncouth incompetent cretins went. If his mother allowed it, Homer would attend a private club.\n\nHe never went to the beach or boating. Both of his parents' views on the world were well-absorbed by him. The masses were filthy and infected everything they touched. It was best to create a domain of your own. Homer played by himself and was educated by tutors.\n\nWhen he was a eighteen, his father died of his stroke. His mother became hysterical and refused to leave her bedroom. Supporting her and himself was Homer's responsibility. He rented a townhouse in the posh district of a city, and with his father's money, he went to the stock exchange. He was surprised at the sort of people allowed inside. Few appeared presentable enough to be invited to a dinner party. After a few moments, he left.\n\nWith the familial connections, Homer went to a man mentored by his father. Edgar seemed to be a decent man with a firm handshake. Although, Homer disliked touching his hand. Edgar promised to mentor Homer in the ways of finance.\n\nSuch a shame that Edgar was a poor student. Within five years, Homer lost a large portion of the family fortune. He had to rent an apartment in an undesirable area, and he had a plumber for a neighbor. His mother passed away as well, and Homer blamed himself for her death.\n\nGrief was not a good motivator. Homer lost more money, and he had to sell the house. With little to do, he went to the library and threw himself into literature. He enjoyed reading about the heroes of old and studied mythology intently.\n\nIt was there that he discovered Ilophat. In every mythology, there was a creature that despised humanity. It always attempted to destroy them only to be thwarted by the gods that were powered by the worship of the masses.\n\nHomer related to the snake deity. One look at the city made anyone believe that they failed. The behavior of the gods reflected the poor moral character of the masses. Perhaps Homer should summon Ilophat. He researched further and found a simple summoning ritual.\n\nOn a cold summer night similar to his birth, Homer created a circle in the grass from salt Around the circle, he made sigils from the book. In the center, he put a snake in a cage. From his pocket, he produced a rotted grape in a handkerchief and dumped that into the cage. The snake refused to eat it.\n\n\"Ilophat.\" Homer chanted in a voice that wasn't deep, but he tried to give it power. \"I summon you to this plain. God of destruction spread chaos and peril across the land.\"\n\nThe snake began to eat the rotted grapes. When it swallowed, its eyes turned a bright purple. Bat wings sprouted from its back, and it flew out of the cage.\n\n\"It's been millennia.\" Ilophat floated before Homer staring into his soul.\n\n\"Oh great creature, how I adore you, and your hatred of humanity.\"\n\n\"Hate humanity? Why do you believe that? Do you hate the ants on the ground? No, humans merely exist. Occasionally, they are annoyances.\"\n\n\"But those foolish gods stop you from destroying us time and time again.\"\n\n\"I derive pleasure from torment every so often, and I stop of my own volition. That doesn't stop others from claiming my choices as a result of their actions.\"\n\n\"Please then. Exert torment on this world. We do not deserve it.\" Homer got on his knees and pleaded. Ilophat smiled.\n\n\"No. Your suffering amuses me. I'd much rather explore the new world in this body.\" Ilophat began to fly away.\n\n\"Please. I am a devoted follower. We understand each other.\"\n\n\"You could never hope to understand my true nature maggot.\" Ilophat shouted as he disappeared into the night. Homer began to cry.

Even if we lose, we'd scorch our Earth than let you have our planet!\"\n\nThe Galacta General Xyville was unimpressed. \"It is by the decree of our late Emperor that we are to conquer.\"\n\n\"Wake up to the smell of bullshit, general,\" the human response was snarky as hell. \"Your Emperor did not rule solely by force and by fear.\"\n\n\"We have his decree here,\" came the dry remark. \"See for yourselves.\"\n\n\"Dude, you're all fucking dumb or what? It says here Conquer fear and bring hope to the galaxy.\"\n\n\"What? What is this blasphemy?\" Xyville roared.\n\n\"Your data dock was corrupted, so my technicians repaired it to restore the full message. Did nobody think to repair the damned thing for half a century?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"General? Are you there? Cat got your tongue?\"\n\n\"General, what are your orders?\" Xyville's deputy asked. \"General?\"\n\n\"We...have misunderstood our Emperor. We will retreat. We will no longer wage war upon Earth. Upon our return, we must speak with the Galacta Senate.

Thirty-five years of marriage and Sarah had never looked this confused. I practically ran to her as I held her in my hands, \"you'll be alright honey\" I said as I carried her to the chair and sat her down. \n\n\"I fell\" she slurred with a wide smile on her face\n\nA huge knot started up on my stomach, was she bleeding inside? Was the fall that bad? I gently turned Sarah's head to the side to get a closer look at her cut. The knot in my stomach tightened and dropped as soon as I saw it. It wasn't the wound that got me, it was the lack of a wound. Her skull was filled with tiny wires and blinking lights, instead of bone and muscles it was all just metal. \n\n​​\"John?\" Sarah's voice sounded far away. \"What's wrong?\" \n\n\"You're okay, baby\" I said trying to hide the crack in my voice \"Just a little rest and you'll be good as new\"\n\nSarah reached for me. Her fingers brushed my arm, and I flinched away without thinking. She looked hurt that I'd pulled away, the hurt in her eyes, it looked real. It looked so human, it made me want to scream.\n\n\"You're bleeding,\" I managed to choke out. \"Sit down. I'll get the first aid kit.\"\n\nI stumbled to the bathroom and barely managed to lock the door behind me before I fell on top of the sink. I couldn't recognize the face in the mirror, what was going on. My face was pale and my eyes were wide with terror .I splashed water on my face but it didn't help \"This is just a dream, just a big bad dream\" I whisper to myself, pacing in the bathroom\n\nMy mind was racing. Thirty-five years of marriage, two kids, countless memories. Was it all a lie? I felt sick to my stomach. I had to get back out there, had to face whatever the hell was going on. But my legs wouldn't move. I was frozen, I couldn't look away from the mirror.\n\n\"JOHN, JOHN\" Sarashs voice yelled from across the house \"WHERE ARE YOU?\" It was weird, she sounded terrified as she called for me, she sounded scared \n\nI swallowed hard, trying to get rid of the lump in my throat \"I'm coming honey\" \n\nA knock on the door made me jump not even a  second after I had replied back to my wife. \"John?\" it was Sarah's voice. It sounded normal now, concerned. \"Are you okay in there?\"\n\nI took a deep breath, grabbed the first aid kit from behind the mirror, and opened the door with a wide smile on my face. Sarah was standing there, looking worried. \n\n\"Now let's take a look at that cut,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nAs I reached to turn her head, Sarah caught my wrist without even a glance at my arm. Her grip was strong. Far too strong.\n\n\"Sweetie,\" she said softly. \"I know you know, Theres something I need to show you.\"\n\nSarah led me to our bedroom, her hand still clasped around my wrist as she dragged me alone. She reached under the bed and pulled out an old, leather-bound book. I recognized it immediately - it was the diary she'd kept when we first met, the one she'd always said was too personal to share.\n\n\"I think it's time you read this,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI opened the diary, what was going on? I didn't know how to feel as I read the first few pages. They were filled with hundreds of observations about human behavior. It was written in a detached neutral tone, it was almost freaky how little emotions were behind her words\n\nThe more I flipped through the pages the more, I saw my name appearing more and more frequently. I kept flipping through the pages, faster and faster, I wasn't even reading the words on the pages anymore, I just wanted this nightmare to be over\n\nAll the entries about me just referred to me as her subject. \"Subject John displays typical human mating behaviors,\" one read. \"He appears to view me as a potential mate. The pet could prove useful for my mission.\"\n\nMy heart sank as I read entry after entry describing me as little more than a test subject, she kept calling me her pet to be studied and manipulated. Tears began to well up in my eyes, I could see a few wet drops fall on the old brown pages of her journal as the teras began to fall down my face without a care in the world.\n\n\"I'm a pet?\" I questioned, looking at the pages, my eyes wouldn't move from the word. The word \"Pet\" \n\n\"I haven't felt that way in a long time, John,\" she said, she sounded almost sad. \"What you read at the beginning - that was before that was all wrong. Who I am now is someone else, I can love, John. You taught me that. You made me who I am and I love you.\"\n\n\"I'm just a pet\" I repeated\n\n​​\"I have made a decision that goes against everything I was programmed for when I was sent to observe. I chose you John. I choose love. I choose humanity, with all its flaws, because then I got to have you. Whatever I was before, whatever my original purpose was, it no longer matters and it nevers has. I am Sarah, and I am in love.\"\n\nShe took my hands in hers, her touch was just as soft as I had always remembered it, not like the tight grip she had on me before. \"I know this is a lot to take in,\" she said, moving my head up to look at her now. \"I know you must have a thousand questions. But please believe me when I say that my love for you, for our children, for the life we've built together - it's all real. It's the most real thing I've ever known.\"\n\nThe sun shined through the window, shining a beautiful yellow light on her face, lighting up her beautiful emerald green eyes even more than usual. \"I love you, John\"", "text_len": null, "category": "story_writing", "base_prompt": "[Task]: Write an engaging story based on the following writing prompt.\n[Writing Prompt]: Your wife/husband of 35 years comes to you looking dazed. \"I fell.
