{"id": "text_completion_000", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Keystone Park: Part 1 - Living in Fear\nI\"ve never been one for the spooky and strange stuff that people with paranoia always talk about. You will never see me standing on the side of an argument where someone is saying their house is bugged or someone is living in their attic. Even if that is the case, I don\"t really give a damn. If someone has bugged the house, come and get me if what I\"m saying is that bad. And if some random person is living in the walls or ceiling, more power to them as long as they don\"t bother me.\nBut when you have someone like Fin, a complete psychopath trying to destroy our lives, you have to stay on guard 24/7. I gave birth to him, and I know the evil he is capable of. No one but me knows the magnitude of the crazy we are dealing with. When you\"re a mother, some things are best left unspoken, but when you know, you know. And lately, I\"ve been feeling like someone is constantly watching. Even before he went to jail, I never felt this way.\n\n*** Text between my boyfriend and I ***\n\nMe - Is it annoying as hell? Absolutely. But I\"ve never had these feelings and vibes except for the last week or two. When you know, you just know, and whatever this feeling is about, it\"s got to do with our privacy. I\"m paranoid about him 24/7 because I know if he is in an \"I don\"t give a fuck\" mindset, he will come up in here and do whatever he pleases. No matter who is here, if he lives or dies, jail or prison, when he wants something, he gets it. The cost is never too much for him. I promise you that.\n\nMy boyfriend\n\n\"I checked in a few places under the house. I didn't hear or see anything right then but I definitely heard that noise when we were outside. The cat kept running around real weird too\"\nMy boyfriend- \"I know what you mean. Last night I felt like something was trying to tell me something. And guess what fell from above and floated right in front of me when I squatted down to look under the house…. A feather\"\n\nMe- \"I mean he could have did all kinds of stuff. He could have a 2 way radio under there to just creep us out. And with as much stuff as old man Frye prob has I\"m sure it wouldn\"t be hard for umm to get his hands on something to do just that. Unbeknownst to Glenn of course. He wouldn\"t condone it. \"\n\nMy boyfriend \"I have felt like somebody has been sneaking up to the building and trying to look in it and shit for about the same amount of time. Like since he got out. We gotta get away from him and from here\"\n\nMe \"Last night after I heard the weird shit I was sitting in here and I had just opened back up the floor vent. Cause it was getting hot again. Well about 7-8 mins later I felt like I was gonna pass the fuck out and wasn\"t gonna be able to control myself doing so. Like not a sleepy pass out. More like a dizzy going under anesthesia kind of feeling it was really weird. I turned on the fan and the feeling subsided. But I was a little weirded out by that\n\nI remember the early signs, the little things that hinted at the chaos to come. The temper tantrums that grew more violent, the unsettling calmness in his eyes when he got what he wanted. As a mother, you always hope that your child will find their way, that the love and guidance you offer will steer them towards a better path. But with Fin, that hope faded quickly. His defiance turned into something darker, something that made me fear for my safety and the safety of those around me.\n\nThe incidents started small—missing money, broken items, and unexplained absences. I would confront him, but his responses were always cold and calculating, as if he enjoyed the turmoil he was creating. The breaking point came when he began threatening us openly, making it clear that he would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. The police were no help; they could only do so much without concrete evidence, and Fin was smart enough to cover his tracks.\n\nLiving in Keystone Park, our once peaceful home has turned into a fortress. We\"ve installed security cameras, changed locks, and even considered moving. But Fin knows us too well. He knows our routines, our weaknesses, and he exploits them with ruthless precision. Every knock on the door, every unfamiliar sound, sends a jolt of fear through me. I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder, wondering if today is the day he decides to make his next move.\n\nFriends and family offer support, but they can\"t truly understand the depth of this nightmare. They see Fin as the troubled young man who lost his way, not the monster I see in my nightmares. It\"s a lonely battle, fighting to protect the ones you love from someone you once cherished. The guilt is overwhelming—wondering if there was something I could have done differently, if there was a way to save him before he turned into this.\n\nFin\"s unpredictability is what scares me the most. One moment, he could be charming and persuasive, convincing everyone that he\"s changed. The next, he could be plotting our downfall, calculating his next move with chilling precision. It\"s a game of cat and mouse, and I\"m constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nIn the past week, the feeling of being watched has intensified. It\"s as if Fin is everywhere and nowhere at once, his presence lingering in the shadows. I\"ve tried to dismiss it as paranoia, but deep down, I know it\"s real. This isn\"t just a mother\"s fear—it\"s a gut feeling, an instinct honed by years of living with a predator. Fin is watching, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and all I can do is try to stay one step ahead.\n\nThe nights are the worst. I lie awake, listening to every creak and groan of the house, imagining him slipping through the darkness. Sleep offers no respite; my dreams are plagued by visions of his twisted smile, his eyes glinting with malice. Each day is a struggle to maintain some semblance of normalcy, to pretend that everything is okay when it\"s far from it.\n\nThis is our life now, a constant battle for survival against someone who was once a part of us. Fin may be my son, but he\"s also my greatest enemy, and the stakes are higher than ever. This is just the beginning of our story, the first chapter in a long and harrowing journey through Keystone Park. Stay tuned as I continue to share our struggle, our fear, and our fight to reclaim our lives from the clutches of a nightmare.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

My boyfriend and I found ourselves constantly on edge, jumping at every unexpected sound and scrutinizing every shadow. The feeling of being watched had become an ever-present companion, a constant reminder of the danger that lurked just beyond our sight.\n\nOne evening, as we sat in the living room trying to distract ourselves with a movie, a sudden crash from the kitchen sent us both bolting upright. My heart raced as my boyfriend cautiously made his way to investigate. I held my breath, waiting for the worst, but he returned moments later with a bemused look on his face.\n\n\"It was just a pan that fell off the counter,\" he said, but the relief in his voice was palpable. We both knew that in our current state, even the most mundane occurrences could trigger panic.\n\nThe next day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I couldn't shake the feeling that Fin was somehow involved in these strange happenings, so I began to meticulously search the house for any signs of tampering or surveillance equipment. As I combed through each room, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of dread and determination. Part of me hoped to find nothing, to prove that it was all in my head. But another part knew that finding evidence of Fin's interference would at least validate our fears and give us something tangible to act upon.\n\nHours passed, and I found nothing out of the ordinary. Just as I was about to give up, I noticed something strange in the guest bedroom. A small patch of the wallpaper seemed slightly discolored, almost imperceptibly so. With trembling hands, I peeled back the corner, revealing a tiny camera lens embedded in the wall.\n\nMy blood ran cold as the reality of our situation hit me full force. Fin hadn't just been watching us; he'd been living in our walls, observing our every move. The thought made me sick to my stomach, but it also ignited a fierce determination within me. We couldn't live like this anymore – something had to change.\n\nI called my boyfriend immediately, and together we formulated a plan. We would act as if nothing had changed, going about our daily routines as usual. But behind the scenes, we would be preparing our escape. We couldn't risk confronting Fin directly – his unpredictability made him far too dangerous. Instead, we would disappear, leaving no trace for him to follow.\n\nOver the next few weeks, we carefully made our preparations. We set up a new bank account, found a temporary place to stay far from Keystone Park, and slowly began packing our essential belongings. All the while, we maintained our facade of normalcy, knowing that Fin was likely watching our every move.\n\nThe night before our planned departure, I lay awake in bed, my mind racing with a mix of fear and anticipation. Part of me still struggled with the idea of leaving – this was our home, after all, and running felt like admitting defeat. But I knew in my heart that it was the only way to break free from Fin's grip and start anew.\n\nAs dawn broke, we silently loaded our car and prepared to leave Keystone Park behind. Just as we were about to pull out of the driveway, I caught a glimpse of movement in the rearview mirror. For a heart-stopping moment, I thought I saw Fin's face in the shadows of our porch. But when I blinked, the image was gone, leaving me to wonder if it had been real or just a product of my frayed nerves.\n\nWith a deep breath, I turned to my boyfriend and nodded. It was time to go. As we drove away from the only home I'd ever known, I felt a mix of emotions wash over me – fear, sadness, but also a glimmer of hope. We were taking the first step towards reclaiming our lives, towards a future free from the constant fear and paranoia that had become our daily reality.\n\nBut even as we put miles between us and Keystone Park, I couldn't shake the feeling that this was far from over. Fin was resourceful, determined, and above all, patient. I knew that no matter how far we ran or how well we hid, a part of me would always be looking over my shoulder, waiting for the day when our past would catch up with us.\n\nFor now, though, we were free. And as the sun rose higher in the sky, casting its warm light over the unfamiliar landscape before us, I allowed myself to feel a small spark of optimism.

Little does he know, the next battle is not far behind.\n\n\nJacques arrives on a planet that looks similar to Earth in every way except it's bigger. The city he lands in is the capital of the world named Solis City. He finds a map of the city at the port dock where his ship the Raging Phoenix is at. He makes his way to an Armory that\"s close to the dock. He enters the ramshackle building and talks to the wild looking shopkeeper. The shopkeeper says \"Welcome to Pinpoint, the highest rated gun shop among tourists.\"\n\nJacques responds as he looks around the shop. \"I highly doubt that.\"\n\n\"Well rude guy, anything you in the market for? My name\"s Keith by the by, what\"s yours stranger?\"\n\n\"Jacques and I\"m looking for a new rifle, preferably any pre-voyage relics.\"\n\n\"Holy hell pre-voyage!? You're looking for some real strange stuff, but lucky for you I'm selling a pristine relic, called the Kalashnikov AK47.\"\n\nJacques\" eyes sparked and he walked over shaking the rickety wooden floorboards with each step. As Jacques is examining the gun Keith takes notice of something and asks. \"You're a big guy, what cybernetics are you rocking?\"\n\nJacques switches his gaze to the short stocky man and as his demeanor changes, a fear starts to fill Keith. Jacques responds \"None, I'm all natural. I can't have that damn federation knowing anything about me.\"\n\nKeith gathers his resolve and responds \"That\"s a fair answer plus you look good for no enhancements.\"\n\n\"Why thank you man. How much for the relic?\"\n\n\"The asking price is 30,000 credits.\"\n\n\"I'll give you 100,000 credits if you give me the gun, don't do any paperwork or ask any more questions.\"\n\n\"With all due respect Mr. Jacques, I highly doubt you have that much on your person.\"\n\nThe white, ring-like device on his back begins to glow and a bag manifests and floats into his hand. He drops the bag and subsequently some of the credits fall out. \"Now the gun please, unless you need more?\"\n\nA stunned Keith responds \" Naw this is plenty. Take the gun I'll say it fell off the truck.\"\n\nJacques chuckles a bit and says \"Thanks.\"\n\nHe then takes the gun, as he is further examining the weapon the ring on his back starts to glow. After a few short minutes the gun floats up into the air, flies straight into the device and disappears. He exits the store and notices a swath of people rushing to an area of the city in electric anticipation. In his curiosity he follows the ecstatic and unruly crowd. Following them for a few blocks he notices advertisements for a summit that is occurring that day. He makes the assumption that is where they are going.\n\nOne hour later\n\nThe summit starts and a group of people dressed in colorful costumes and capes are giving a speech. Jacques is happy and filled with hope seeing a new rise of heroes. A new era of heroes trying to stop the tyranny of the Galactic Federation just as he is. The Crusaders of The Cosmos. A new dawn in his eyes. Then, one sentence said by MKUltria sinks his entire being into a raging inferno. She said \"We, with the support of the Galactic Federation, can bring peace and prosperity across the sector, And hopefully the entire multiverse.\" Jacques is furious. His mind is descending into a swirling torrent of anger, sadness, and confusion. \"Why do they support them now? Why would they make a superhero team? Is this just to taunt me? To put me off my edge? Why, oh why did they have to die? Why did they kill my family if they would go back and do this?\"\n\nThen it dawns on him. He must kill them. No one can truly be a hero under the heel of the Galactic Federation. They will just be used for a revenue boost for the federation. They will hurt or even kill people if they are run by the federation. Jacques makes his way to the stage. One of the heroes, NightHawk, looks directly at him and starts to signal the rest of the heroes. Another hero, Bombastia says \"Hey you, scary looking guy in the mountain camo pants and black shirt. Are you Jacques Marcus, The Monster?\"\n\nJacques gets on stage and says \"Yeah.\"\n\nBombastia steps closer to Jacques while showing off his ability, making explosive fireballs in his hands, and says. \" Who do you think you are coming to this planet, no to this sector? With all the blood you've spilled didn't you think we'd kill you on sight.\"\n\nJacques gets closer to Bombastia and responds. \"Do you really think I'm gonna let a guy dressed in orange tights and a cape even lay a hand on me?\"\n\nNightHawk lunges over and says \"I've already sent a distress call. The other crusaders are on their way.\"\n\nMKUltria rushes over to the side of the stage next to Bombastia and says \"We need to kill you Jacques. You are a pure manifestation of evil. Please understand. In order to secure a better tomorrow. We need to kill you.\"\n\nBombastia lunges at Jacques while putting a fireball in his face and says. \"Yeah, so be a good boy and die already.\"\n\nJacques picks him up by the neck and chuckles. He cracks Bombastia's neck and says. \"Don't worry. He's not dead yet, just paralyzed. I want him to be in complete despair before he dies y'know. Like the true villain you say I am.\"\n\nHe then crushes Bombastia's head and throws his corpse in the crowd of horrified people. As the people all run away and hide, Jacques says. \"You said you need to kill me to secure a better tomorrow? That's too bad. None of you will live to see it.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

NightHawk, utilizing his enhanced agility, leaped towards Jacques with a flurry of punches and kicks. MKUltria, her eyes glowing with psychic energy, attempted to invade Jacques' mind.\n\nJacques, however, proved to be a formidable opponent. He effortlessly dodged NightHawk's attacks, his movements fluid and precise. As for MKUltria's psychic assault, Jacques' mind seemed impenetrable, protected by an unknown force.\n\n\"You think your parlor tricks can stop me?\" Jacques sneered, his eyes burning with a mix of rage and determination. \"I've faced far worse than you lot.\"\n\nWith lightning speed, Jacques grabbed NightHawk mid-air and slammed him into the ground, the impact leaving a small crater in the stage. MKUltria, realizing her psychic abilities were ineffective, resorted to physical combat, launching energy bolts at Jacques.\n\nAs the battle raged on, sirens could be heard in the distance. The Galactic Federation's forces were approaching, responding to the distress call.\n\nJacques, sensing the impending arrival of reinforcements, decided to make his point clear. He activated the ring-like device on his back, and suddenly, an arsenal of weapons materialized around him. Among them was the newly acquired AK47.\n\n\"You see,\" Jacques addressed the remaining heroes and the terrified onlookers, \"this is what your 'peace and prosperity' looks like. The Federation using you as their puppets, while they continue to oppress and destroy.\"\n\nMKUltria, bruised but still standing, retorted, \"You're wrong, Jacques. We're making a difference. We're saving lives!\"\n\nJacques' expression softened for a moment, a flicker of sadness in his eyes. \"I once believed that too. But the Federation... they took everything from me. My family, my hope, my very humanity.\"\n\nAs Federation ships began to descend upon the scene, Jacques made a decision. He wouldn't kill these misguided heroes today. Instead, he would show them the truth.\n\nWith a swift motion, Jacques activated a device on his wrist. A holographic projection appeared, showing classified Federation documents - evidence of their atrocities, their true intentions, and the manipulation of the Crusaders of The Cosmos.\n\n\"This is your 'better tomorrow,'\" Jacques said, his voice filled with bitterness. \"A lie built on the bones of innocents.\"\n\nThe remaining heroes and the crowd watched in horror as the truth unfolded before their eyes. Doubt began to creep into their minds, the facade of the Federation's benevolence crumbling.\n\nAs the Federation forces closed in, Jacques prepared for his escape. He turned to the heroes one last time. \"You have a choice now. Continue being their pawns, or open your eyes to the truth. The real battle for the multiverse is just beginning.\"\n\nWith that, Jacques activated his ring device once more. In a blinding flash of light, he vanished, leaving behind a scene of chaos, destruction, and shattered illusions.\n\nAs the dust settled, MKUltria and NightHawk exchanged troubled glances. The seed of doubt had been planted, and the line between hero and villain had become blurred. The true nature of their mission and allegiance was now in question.\n\nMeanwhile, Jacques materialized in his ship, the Raging Phoenix. As he set coordinates for his next destination, he knew that his fight against the Federation was far from over. But perhaps, he thought, he had just gained some unexpected allies in his crusade for justice.\n\nThe Raging Phoenix disappeared into the vastness of space, leaving behind a world forever changed by the revelations of the day.

{"id": "text_completion_002", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Chapter One\n\n\nTitle unsure\n\nSam pulled his phone out of his pocket and hurriedly went to check his email inbox.\n\n\"Come one, come on.\"\n\nHe thought as he waited for it to load.\n\n\"Yes! There it is!\" He murmured to himself.\n\nHe quickly opened what he had been waiting for. It was a job interview for a forklift operator. Sure, the wage was low but Sam whether he realized it or not really needed this. He'd just gotten out of rehab and the halfway house he was staying in required that he have some form of legal employment. Sam knew that if he could just get an interview, he could get the job and be back on his way to proving to everyone that he was finally a changed man.\n\nHe put his phone back into his pocket, grabbed his keys and left his room. The halfway house was an old brownstone in downtown Portland. Sam had been told that he had found a \"good one\" though the state of the home made him never want to find out what a \"bad one\" looked like. The old worn floorboards creaked with every step. As he made his way down the narrow and steep steps he was hit with the damp rotting smell of the street coming through the now open front door.\n\nIt was Mr. Hawthorne the home caretaker. He had just come in with a handful of mail. Mr. Hawthorne was a kindly old man of about 70. He had thick grey hair that he always kept trimmed neatly. He was a person that you couldn't imagine being younger as if he had somehow always looked this way. Stuck in his old age, as if he were meant to be there.\n\n\"Nothing for you today Samuel.\" He said plainly. \"Where are ya off to?\" He asked.\n\n\"A job interview!\" Sam said excitedly and with an air of pride.\n\n\"Excellent, excellent Samuel.\" Said Mr. Hawthorne pleasantly. \"Let me know how it goes! And best of luck!\"\n\nSam padded Mr. Hawthorne in his shoulder as he passed him in the entryway \"Thanks, Mr. Hawthorne and I will!\" He said happily.\n\nSam stepped out into the street. It had just finished raining and the damp smell of a decaying city filled his lungs. This reminded Sam of where he was from. Not because of the smell of the city but because every time he stepped outside he was reminded that he didn't belong there. Sam was raised on a small farm in Montana. How he ended up here brought him great shame. But, he was heading to a place to hopefully help him right all of his wrongs.\n\nHe walked down the block and turned the corner. There sat his 1999 Honda Civic. For starters no one had smashed the window so he was already in the positive. He unlocked the door and hopped inside.\n\n\"Alright you old son of a bitch, come on now.\" He thought as he pushed in the clutch and turned the ignition. The cars engine sputtered, spat and rolled its way to life.\n\nSam smiled a sense that this was all going o work out suddenly washed over him. The old Honda rarely started on the first try! He put it into gear and started down the road. A road he hoped would lead him out of this city and perhaps back home.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nArrival\n\nSam was relieved that the warehouse was far from the city proper and out in the suburbs of Portland. Anytime he was able to escape the city he felt a weight lifted off of his shoulders. He pulled into the massive parking lot of the warehouse and headed for the door on its southern corner where the e-mail had told him his interview would be at. The parking lot seemed eerily empty but it was a Sunday. The woman who wrote the email explained to him that she was only able to schedule his interview for that time because of some logistical issues.\n\nHe found a spot near the doorway that read \"new hires\" above it. Sam grabbed his phone and wallet and headed inside. As he entered the lobby he saw rows of empty chairs and a front desk that was currently empty. Sam walked up to the desk tentatively. The lobby looked like any large doctors office waiting room. The harsh artificial lights, the smell of cheap carpet slightly put him on edge. He stood at the desk for a moment before he finally uttered a tentative \"Hello?\" His voice seemed to echo around the great space and down the long hallway behind the desk.\n\nJust before he was about to toss out another meek \"hello?\" A kindly woman appeared through a cracked door behind the reception area.\n\n\"Coming!\" She said anxiously!\n\n\"Sorry, sorry, I wasn't supposed to be here this morning! My name is Christine! I had to cover for a colleague who called in sick! I'm a bit behind! You must be Samuel! You're the only one scheduled for an interview today! Here, take this packet and fill it out. When you're finished bring it back up and I'll let Mr. McMaster know you're here!\" She said with much haste.\n\nShe handed Sam the packet on a clip board with a pen and directed him to take a seat at any of the empty chairs behind him. Sam sat down and started filling the packet out. It was all normal job interview stuff. But this presented a problem for Sam as he had just left rehab. Sam didn't have any references aside from Mr. Hawthorn. Sure, he could put down some old friends from the service but he didn't know their numbers anymore. So, he just put down Mr. Hawthorne for now. If they had any questions about it he figured he could answer them during the actual interview. Sam figured that the less they knew about him the better his chances would be of getting the job. After all this wasn't NASA they just wanted someone to drive a forklift around a warehouse.\n\nHe handed the packet back to Christine who was ostensibly busy answering emails on her computer. She smiled and said \"let me get this to the supervisor! He'll have you back in just a moment!\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" Sam said and he went back and sat down waiting anxiously. \"What if they ask about my past? They surely will.\" He thought. \"What should I tell them? The truth? No, that's not gonna work. Maybe a half truth.\" Before he could finish his thought Christine stood up and said \"Sam! He'll see you now!\"\n\nChapter Three\n\nRabbit hole\n\nSam was led into a back room in the middle of a hallway that had to of been 100 yards long. Christine opened the door to a small bland grey office that Mr. McMasters was sitting in. He appeared to be fast at work typing. Sam took in the room. Small, grey, bland and very cookie cutter. Not a distinguishing feature in it. No personal pictures, nothing. Very utilitarian. Very impersonal. The only thing that caught Sam's eye was a fancy machine in the corner that appeared to be some type of water dispenser. Complete with glass cups and napkins on a table near it.\n\n\"Please please Sit.\" Said Mr. McMaster his voice booming and commanding. As he stood he stretched his hand out toward Sam. Mr. McMaster was a commandingly large man. At least six foot four and 250 pounds. Despite his size and deep voice he appeared very friendly and almost child-like.\n\nSam shook his hand and was immediately intimidated by Mr. McMasters massive hands and grip strength. Sam squeezed his hand firmly but could tell that McMaster was holding back considerably. They both sat.\n\n\"Samuel, nice to meet you! I'm Gregory McMaster, please just call me Greg. I'm so glad you could make it in today. We really need someone in that spot and I think you're gonna work out.\"\n\nSam was already feeling relieved. Oddly before he could get a word out Greg said \"hey, saw ya looking at the water machine we have there in the corner. Pretty cool looking right?\" He said with a smile on his face.\n\n\"This is one of our CEO's inventions believe it or not. See, this thing makes its own 'spring water' fresh as the Rockies man! You won't believe it! Here let me grab you a glass!\"\n\n\"I'm alright\" Sam said calmly\n\n\"No, no I insist I have my manager hell to get me one of these in my office!\"\n\n\"Okay, sure sure\" said Sam with his hand outreached taking the now full glass from Greg's massive hand.\n\nSam took a tentative sip. He was almost taken back, it really did taste like spring water! \"Hey! You weren't kidding!\" He said surprisingly!\n\n\"I love this thing man\" Greg said as he leaned against the machine analyzing it. \"She's something else huh?\"\n\n\"Sure is..\" Said Sam but the words coming out of his mouth felt funny. Must be his nerves he thought. Sam looked up quickly trying to calm himself down but the room seemed to roll and shift. \"Hey, uhh what did you'd say was in this?\" He murmured to the spinning room. Then, total blackness.\n\nChapter Four\n\nWaking up at the bottom.\n\nThe first thing Sam realized as he floated back into consciousness was the acute feeling of his head throbbing. Then, as his sense slowly began to warm up from there cold slumber he realized he was laying down and that he was comfortable. For a moment he just laid there before a sudden and quick blast of consciousness asked him \"hey, where are we?\" His eyes shot open only to be closed reflexively by a blinding light above his head. He raised his hands to cover his eyes and slowly sat up. As his vision adjusted to the brightness of the room he looked around. He was laying on a hospital bed. The room appeared to be solid concrete with a sloping drain in the middle. One large door was directly in the center of the far wall. It was heavy and metallic with a small slit at the top. Sam's confusion began to give way to abject panic as he peered around the room.\n\nHe jumped out of the bed, and ran over to the large door. He banged loudly and yelled \"Hey! Hello!\" Suddenly the room light switched from a harsh white to a dark and powerful red. A voice echoed around the concrete walls.\n\n\"Please step away from the door.\" It said robotically. \"Assistance is on the way.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Chapter Five\n\nThe Facility\n\nSam stumbled back from the door, his heart racing. The red light cast an eerie glow across the room, making it feel even more claustrophobic. He tried to piece together what had happened, but his memories were fragmented. The last thing he clearly remembered was the interview with Greg and that strange water.\n\nMinutes passed, feeling like hours, before the heavy door finally creaked open. Two figures in hazmat suits entered, their faces obscured behind tinted visors.\n\n\"Subject 247, please remain calm,\" one of them said, voice muffled by the suit. \"We're here to conduct some routine tests.\"\n\n\"Tests? What tests? Where am I?\" Sam demanded, backing away until he hit the wall.\n\nThe other figure approached with a device that looked like a scanner. \"This won't hurt. It's just a quick health check.\"\n\nSam's instincts screamed at him to resist, but he was outnumbered and trapped. He allowed them to scan him, watching as data scrolled across a small screen on the device.\n\n\"Vitals stable. Cognitive functions appear normal,\" the figure muttered.\n\n\"What's going on? I don't understand,\" Sam pleaded, his voice cracking.\n\nThe first figure spoke again, \"You've been selected for a special program, Samuel. Your background made you an ideal candidate.\"\n\nSam's blood ran cold. \"My background? You mean...\"\n\n\"Your time in rehab, yes. We seek out individuals who've shown resilience and a desire to change. This facility is designed to help you reach your full potential.\"\n\nSam's mind raced. This couldn't be legal. He thought of Mr. Hawthorne, of the halfway house. Did anyone know where he was?\n\n\"I want to leave,\" Sam said firmly. \"I didn't agree to this.\"\n\nThe figures exchanged a glance. \"I'm afraid that's not possible at this stage, Samuel. But I assure you, this is for your own good. You'll understand soon enough.\"\n\nThey gestured for him to follow them out of the room. Sam hesitated, considering making a run for it, but where would he go? He was in completely unfamiliar territory.\n\nWith a heavy heart, he followed them into a long, sterile hallway. As they walked, Sam noticed other doors similar to his, each with a number. He caught glimpses of other confused-looking individuals through small windows.\n\n\"Welcome to Project Rebirth, Samuel,\" one of the figures said as they approached a large set of double doors. \"Your new life begins now.\"\n\nThe doors swung open, revealing a vast, open area filled with various stations and equipment. Sam's head spun as he tried to take it all in. Whatever this place was, whatever they had planned for him, he knew one thing for certain: he had to find a way out.\n\nChapter Six\n\nOrientation\n\nThe next few hours were a blur of medical examinations, psychological evaluations, and endless questionnaires. Sam felt like a lab rat, poked and prodded from every angle. He tried to gather as much information as he could, but the staff remained tight-lipped about the true nature of the facility.\n\nFinally, he was led to a small auditorium with about two dozen other confused-looking individuals. A tall, slender woman with sharp features stepped up to a podium at the front of the room.\n\n\"Welcome, candidates,\" she began, her voice crisp and authoritative. \"I'm Dr. Eliza Roth, head of Project Rebirth. You're all here because you've demonstrated a capacity for change and growth. Our goal is to help you unlock your full potential and become productive members of society once more.\"\n\nSam listened intently, trying to read between the lines. This all sounded too good to be true, and his instincts told him there was more to it than they were letting on.\n\nDr. Roth continued, \"Over the next few weeks, you'll undergo a series of treatments and training exercises designed to rewire your neural pathways and eliminate destructive behaviors. It won't be easy, but I promise you, the results will be worth it.\"\n\nA man in the front row raised his hand. \"And what if we don't want to participate?\"\n\nDr. Roth's smile didn't reach her eyes. \"I'm afraid that's not an option. You've all been legally remanded to our care. Think of this as a second chance, a opportunity to make amends for past mistakes.\"\n\nSam's heart sank. He was trapped, possibly for weeks or even months. He thought of his plans to turn his life around, to prove to everyone he had changed. Now, he was right back where he started – locked up and at the mercy of others.\n\nAs the orientation continued, Sam's mind raced. He needed to find a way out, but he also needed to play along for now. He'd have to be smart, gather information, and look for any weakness in their security.\n\nOne thing was certain: the road ahead would be challenging, but Sam was determined to fight his way back to freedom – and to the life he'd been so close to reclaiming.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text in terms of plot, character development, and tone.

{"id": "text_completion_003", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The golden rays of early morning shone into the shelter, landing on the boy's eyes. This stirred him from sleep and through instinct, he immediately clutched at his chest, making sure it was still there. A small pouch tied to a cord draped around his neck, the reason he embarked on this journey. He crawled from the hovel of branches and dead leaves into the forest. The trees were beginning to shed, and the ground was damp. The dense woods turning light brown. The boy set out to look for food.\n\n\nSilent and slow, the boy explored the forested basin, bow in hand. There were no signs of anything larger than himself there. No trails, no droppings, nothing that might provide the boy with a meal that would last longer than a few days. Birds would do. So, the boy continued, his gaze focused on the forest canopy. While terrain, weather and people might have changed throughout his journey, hunger was the only certainty.\n\nSome time later, the boy managed to shoot down two scrawny cranes and had them tied around his waist. He spied a swan resting at the banks of the river. It was far, but his father taught him to shoot well. The boy focused, drew in a breath, and loosed the arrow. It grazed the swan's neck, and struck a rock behind it, flint tip shattering. The swan began twitching on the gravel bank, the indirect strike broke its neck. Before the boy approached the dying bird, he noticed a rustling in the bushes next to it. He stopped and waited. A wild dog emerged, just as cautious as the boy, and slowly padded towards the swan. The boy could see its ribs clearly through the dogs matted fur, its shoulder blades threatening to break through its skin. He let the dog take his kill.\n\nIt was raining heavily. The boy decided to make camp inside a deadfall at the banks of the river. The boy sat soaked and shivering next to his fire. As he dried, he dreamt of warmer lands, and of the place he received his gift.\n\nThe sun steadily grew warmer. The lands changing from a lush green to dry grass and eventually to dust and cracked rock. The people also changed. They spoke in a language strange to the boy, guiding him with vague gestures and garbled tongues. He stumbled through the desert, trailing behind his guides, accumulating other ragged followers as they went. Then he saw it. Just along the shimmering horizon was a blot of green atop a hill. A beacon in the desert calling out to lost pilgrims seeking to gain its knowledge.\n\nAs the weary group approached the high perched temple, the dry winds carried the stench of rotting flesh. Bodies lay strewn on the sand, swarmed by countless vultures. Their decaying flesh being ripped from the bone by great hooked beaks, their bones to be returned in time to that sacred place atop the hill. Like the wilderness surrounding it, the temple's rites embodied all aspects of life; With death being a necessity for birth and growth.\n\nThe boy plunged his face into the natural spring at the gates of the temple, wetting his parched throat and blistered face. A plant grew around the spring, and it grew like no other plant the boy had ever seen. Lines were dug into the earth, allowing water to flow through impossibly straight rows of tall grass. He knew that this was the reason he was sent here.\n\nThe days grew longer and longer, with more and more travellers arriving at the oasis. The boy was sitting in the large camp of strangers and the sun had reached its highest point of the year when they were summoned into the temple.\n\nThe boy surveyed the cavernous hall, perplexed. A juxtaposition of the natural and artificial. The large room was composed of straight lines and sharp angles, yet etched into the stone was lifelike depictions of the desert fauna; Foxes chasing rabbits, herds of wild horses running along the walls of the room, and in the centre a mighty pillar carrying the image of a large vulture, its magnificent wings spread, scythe beak turned to the side on full display.\n\nThe ceremony began with the beating of drums echoing off the high walls. A large stone basin was brought before the audience. With elegant movements, the temple's residents poured soil into the basin. A human bone was ground up, the bleached white powder scattered onto the soil. They produced seeds from small pouches hung around their necks and buried it in the basin's loose mixture. Next, they poured that life giving water from the spring onto the soil and began to dance around the room. The boy's eyes traced their swirling and noticed the moon carvings on the walls. Waxing and waning stone circles. This dance was the passage of time. Each lap of the hall representing months. All while the seed waited in damp soil.\n\nThe boy and his fellow travellers were ushered out of the hall and were led to the spring with the strange grass. The grass was cut from the ground and beaten against a flat rock releasing its grain, the stalks being cast aside. The grain was ground down, mixed with water, and baked over a fire. The audience feasted on this new food, along with all manner of desert beasts and a thick liquid that made the boy feel dizzy. The boy hadn't feasted so much in his entire life. But food wasn't the gift he had come all this way to receive, at least not in this form. When it was time for them to leave the temple, each group of travellers were presented with a small pouch much like those the dancers wore. The families rejoiced at receiving this benevolent gift, the boy received his gift alone.\n\nThe land was dusted with frost, cold winds funnelled through the mountain pass biting at the boy's skin. Occasionally he would glance behind him, spotting the same wild dog watching from behind a rock or quickly running out of sight. It had been trailing behind him ever since he had shot down that swan.\n\nThe boy paused for a moment, then quickly ducked down behind a mound of loose stone. There was a clearing in the woods below, and noises. Speech. A group began to enter the clearing. A band of young men, around the boys age, carrying spears and clubs, wearing the skins of great beasts. He had heard of such people from some of the pilgrims in the desert. Boys sent out into the wilderness, tasked with killing a creature stronger than them, wearing its skin, and returning as men. The boy could hear them from far up the mountain ridge. No doubt the animals in that forest did too. The rear of the line finally emerged into the clearing. They were dragging along women bound at the wrist. Stripped bare, some younger than the boy, some with hair beginning to grey. Most had distended bellies hanging from skeletal frames wholly unsuited for the burden of pregnancy. The boy waited; Still frozen in place long after the party had disappeared back into the treeline. When he could only hear the natural sounds of the forest once more, he rose to his feet and looked up at a path further up the mountain. The wide eyes of the dog stared back at him, waiting for the boy to move ahead so that it too could stand up and continue its journey.\n\nAs time passed, the land grew a thick coating of snow. Food was even harder to come by now, yet with each kill he would leave a small pile of refuse some way away from his camp. It would always be gone by the next morning. He didn't see the dog much. It was a careful companion, and rightfully so. The boy had noticed the dog's belly swelling over time; It would have pups any day now.\n\nAmongst the snowcapped trees the boy found a glacial lake. Shimmering blue reflecting the cloudless winter sky above it. He would be able to fish here, possibly enough to last him the remainder of the journey. He didn't know how close he was. He thought he recognised the land surrounding him, yet the drifting snow made him uncertain. He made camp in a small cove along the lakeshore, weaving basket shaped traps and leaving a pile of slightly damp wood for a fire later.\n\nThe boy paced along the water, dropping traps where forest streams fed the lake. While he waited, he chipped at the edges of his knife, dull stone flaking off to reveal a hidden sharp edge. The traps hadn't caught as many as he'd hoped, but it'd keep him fed, and that was enough. After gutting the fish with his newly renovated knife and draping them over the smoky fire to dry, he walked a little bit further down the shore and left a pile of offal. He placed a whole fish at the top, for the pups.\n\nBack at the camp he stripped down, leaving the small pouch tucked in a crevice for safekeeping. It was a while since he bathed, but it wasn't raining now, and he had a fire to dry off next to. He made his way back to the edge of the water and looked down, gazing at his reflection in the water. It revealed someone unrecognisable to the boy, pale goose pimpled skin stretched over a wiry frame, more bone than muscle. Hair also began to sprout on his upper lip, this journey had changed him.\n\nHe tread the freezing water until his feet began to go numb and the sun began to set. As he emerged from the lake, he noticed that the pile of guts was left untouched. No matter, it would be gone by tomorrow. With shaky steps he went back to the camp, barricading the entrance with stones and fallen branches to keep the heat in. He sat next to the fire clutching the gift around his neck, hoping he would see his family again soon.\n\nA sharp gust of wind entered the cove, waking the boy up. Through sleep blurred eyes he saw figures standing over him. He shot up, spun to the entrance, and saw them clearly. The pelt hunters. The eldest stood before him, a cloak of thick sandy coloured fur slung over his shoulder, grinning with teeth that were beginning to brown. An unseen blow struck the side of the boy\"s head, and he went back to sleep.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The boy awoke with a throbbing pain in his head, his vision blurry and unfocused. As his senses slowly returned, he realized he was no longer in his makeshift shelter by the lake. Instead, he found himself in a dimly lit cave, the sound of crackling fire and muffled voices echoing off the stone walls.\n\nPanic set in as he reached for his neck, but the pouch containing his precious gift was gone. He tried to move, only to discover his hands and feet were bound with rough rope. The boy's heart raced as he struggled against his restraints, the coarse fibers digging into his skin.\n\n\"He's awake,\" a gruff voice announced. The pelt hunters gathered around him, their eyes gleaming with curiosity and suspicion. The leader, the one with the sandy-colored fur cloak, crouched down beside the boy.\n\n\"What's your name, boy?\" he asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. When the boy remained silent, the man continued, \"We don't mean you harm. We're just curious about what you're doing out here alone.\"\n\nThe boy's eyes darted around the cave, searching for an escape route or a glimpse of his belongings. \"Where is it?\" he croaked, his voice hoarse from disuse.\n\nThe leader's brow furrowed. \"Where's what?\"\n\n\"My pouch,\" the boy replied, desperation creeping into his voice. \"Please, I need it. It's important.\"\n\nThe man nodded to one of his companions, who produced the small leather pouch from a nearby pile of belongings. The boy's eyes widened with relief.\n\n\"This?\" the leader asked, holding up the pouch. \"What's so important about it?\"\n\nThe boy hesitated, unsure whether to trust these strangers. But something in the man's eyes – a hint of kindness, perhaps – made him reconsider.\n\n\"It's a gift,\" he explained softly. \"From a temple in the desert. Seeds that can grow even in the harshest conditions. I'm taking them back to my village.\"\n\nThe pelt hunters exchanged glances, their expressions a mix of surprise and intrigue. The leader untied the pouch and peered inside, examining the small, unremarkable seeds.\n\n\"You've come a long way for these,\" he mused. \"Your village must be in dire need.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, memories of his drought-stricken home flooding back. \"We've had no rain for years. Our crops have failed, and people are starving. These seeds... they're our last hope.\"\n\nA heavy silence fell over the cave. The pelt hunters looked at one another, a silent conversation passing between them. Finally, the leader spoke.\n\n\"We've seen the effects of the drought too,\" he said, his voice tinged with sadness. \"It's driven us to do... things we're not proud of.\" His eyes flickered to the entrance of the cave, where the boy now noticed the huddled forms of the captive women.\n\nThe leader continued, \"We took them because we thought they might help us survive. But now I see we were wrong. Your journey, your dedication to your people – it's shown us a better way.\"\n\nWith that, he cut the ropes binding the boy's hands and feet. \"We'll help you get home,\" he declared. \"And we'll return these women to their families. It's time we found a new path.\"\n\nThe boy rubbed his wrists, stunned by this sudden turn of events. As he stood, a familiar shape caught his eye near the cave entrance. The wild dog, her belly now noticeably swollen, watched him with those same attentive eyes.\n\nOver the next few days, an unlikely alliance formed. The pelt hunters, seeking redemption, guided the boy through treacherous mountain passes and across icy rivers. The women, once captives, now walked freely alongside them, their strength and resilience a constant source of inspiration.\n\nAs they traveled, the boy shared what he had learned at the temple – about the cycle of life and death, about nurturing the land and respecting its bounty. The pelt hunters listened intently, their hearts and minds opening to new possibilities.\n\nThe wild dog continued to follow at a distance, a silent guardian on their journey. One crisp morning, as they crested a hill, the boy's heart leaped. In the valley below, he recognized the familiar outlines of his village.\n\nTears welled in his eyes as he turned to his newfound companions. \"Thank you,\" he said, his voice thick with emotion. \"For everything.\"\n\nThe leader placed a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"No, thank you. You've given us more than you know.\"\n\nAs they descended into the village, a crowd began to gather. The boy's family rushed forward, enveloping him in tearful embraces. The pelt hunters stood back, uncertain of their welcome, but the villagers' curiosity soon overcame their initial wariness.\n\nIn the days that followed, a transformation began. The boy and the pelt hunters worked together, teaching the villagers the techniques they had learned for cultivating the desert seeds. The women, reunited with their own people, shared stories of resilience and hope.\n\nAnd as the first green shoots pushed through the cracked earth, nurtured by the knowledge from distant lands and the combined efforts of once-divided people, the boy realized that he had brought back far more than just seeds. He had sown the seeds of change, of unity, and of a future where the harsh realities of survival could be met with compassion and cooperation.\n\nThe wild dog, now a mother to a litter of pups, made her den on the outskirts of the village. Like the new crops taking root in the once-barren soil, she too had found a place to belong, a symbol of the unexpected bonds forged through adversity and the enduring spirit of life itself.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text.

I record this to know and remember how the expedition went. To remember how foolish -- how preposterous was to accept to go there based on nothing but intended miscalculations of those psychopathic, imbeciles from Scientific League.\n\nI should have known to avoid something so utterly irresponsible and suicidal... I had always dreamt to be part of the Scientific League; to hold an well deserved place in the pantheon of the greatest biologists and astrophysicists. So, when my race discovered a new species, I saw a great opportunity that screamed at me.\n\nAll I cared about was my scientific research. I knew that, as soon as they discover it, they\"d send the military to take over, maybe exploit them, though I saw no way in which they could exploit an inferior species.\n\nSo, It took me quite a lot to convince them to take me there, even if it meant enlisting as a rookie. What was I thinking?! ... I had only used guns two times before.\n\nThe first day should have been a great opportunity to get to study them. I landed during midday. Their planet looked better from afar. And quite similar to ours. They called it \"Earth\", I think.\n\nBut it looked deplorable once I moored on. Just a deserted city. The remnants of it, bombed to shreds. Based on the little technology I found, the civilization on their planet was much less advanced than ours. I walked up into a high tower-like building where stairs were spiraling up like a maze towards the sky. It looked ... fascinating.\n\nAnd all that --- brought to ruins. The mountains from that vantage were spectacular though.\n\nCould have been a war. A natural disaster. Civil unrest. An experiment gone wrong... So many possibilities, but the disarray of that planet still baffled me.\n\nI wish I had explored more, but The captain contacted me. One of the drones just vanished. Gone. Looking back, I wish I had never accepted his requirement. Well, my stupid, inquisitive nature took over. Foolish...\n\nI happened upon some dark catacombs through which they traveled in long capsule-like machinery. I think they called it subway trains. Quite interesting. Their mechanics and engineering were a little, little bit primitive. But surprisingly efficient for their needs.\n\nIt was winding around underneath... Filled with debris and, well - what I correctly figured out as being the planet\"s inhabitants corpses. I stubbornly didn\"t want to accept that I had traversed countless solar systems just to see corpses. Though, even that would have been an immense discovery for the scientific community... besides the few dozens forms of life whom my race eradicated. I really, really wanted to encounter a semi-intelligent race which humans seems to have been. Oh, did I mention they are called - they call themselves \"humans\".\n\nI trudged forwards through that dusty, tiny, compact place and came across two subway transportation machineries. And my foolish mind pushed me to do more stupid things. I stepped in. I should have known. It was empty, bar a human skeleton that stared at me. Quite creepy. When I made a step forward to study it...what was I thinking?! it went blank and I woke up in a small place. Surrounded by tiny... curious humans. Well, normal for their race, but...\n\nThey looked somewhat like in the recordings. Just dirtier and more malnourished. Their musculoketal structure did not reflect that of an warrior. Not even their movement which weren\"t that nimble. It was quite remarkable - Their physical attributes didn\"t reflect any high class either. Hairless, stunted creature trapped in the middle of the evolution.\n\nTheir behavior underground was so peculiar. I could only conclude that they were not fit for living in that little odd world that they created underneath. A temporary hideout. that only served as protection and not anything more.\n\nThey wanted to kill me there. Their fear seemed to have overwritten their curiosity. One -- Just one suggested I could be of use. Well, my technology at least, but I could have used that to get out there alive. I tried to speak to them in their language which I picked from the few recordings my race had.\n\nThe leader told me to shut up. Quite a friendly race. Some of them even suspected me of being a creation of their enemy. It seemed preposterous... implausible, but I understood their thinking.\n\nNo matter how much I tried to interject; to find any pitiful clue about their situation, they refused to give me any answers. They kept me tied there and were having a petty squabble about their next steps.\n\nI was almost relieved when their sentinel bursted in. Almost. Too bad that what came next was horrendous. Their sentinel cried \" They\"re coming\" before a blade cut him in two. Ouch! At least he had a quick death.\n\nThe humans around me panicked, all grabbing their weapons as a machine slashed their doors and stepped in. It didn\"t seem that scary. It just resembled them. Just metallic sinews instead of bones. It walked and moved so weird. So rudimentary. It was a mystery how they destroyed; how they took over. Just another rudimentary technology would have been enough.\n\nI tried to wiggle myself out while they shot at... that thing. Witnessing how It overpowered and eradicated them... one by one. It was crazy... \"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Continuation:\n\nAs I watched in horror, the metallic creature methodically dispatched the humans. Their primitive weapons seemed to have little effect on its armored exterior. I realized then that these machines must be the reason for the devastation I had seen on the surface.\n\nIn the chaos, I managed to free myself from my bindings. The humans were too preoccupied with their own survival to notice me. I crawled behind some debris, desperately searching for a way out. That's when I noticed something peculiar about the machine's movements. It seemed to be following a specific pattern, almost as if it were programmed with limited decision-making capabilities.\n\nAs the last human fell, I held my breath, hoping the machine wouldn't detect me. To my surprise, it turned and left the room, apparently satisfied that its task was complete. I waited for what felt like an eternity before I dared to move.\n\nCautiously, I examined the bodies of the fallen humans. Their weapons were indeed primitive, but I noticed something interesting – they had modified some of their technology to emit a specific frequency. It didn't seem to harm the machine, but it did appear to interfere with its sensors momentarily.\n\nI grabbed one of these modified devices and made my way out of the underground shelter. The surface was eerily quiet, save for the distant sound of metal scraping against concrete. I needed to find a way to contact my ship, to warn them about the danger on this planet.\n\nAs I moved through the ruins, I encountered more of these machines. They seemed to be methodically searching the area, eliminating any life forms they came across. I used the human device to create momentary distractions, allowing me to slip past undetected.\n\nHours passed, and I finally managed to reach a high point where I could attempt to send a signal to my ship. But as I activated my communication device, I realized with growing dread that there was no response. The machines had somehow managed to take down our advanced fleet.\n\nMy heart sank as I realized the gravity of the situation. Not only was I stranded on this hostile planet, but my entire civilization might be at risk if these machines had access to our technology.\n\nAs night fell, I heard movement nearby. Preparing for the worst, I was surprised to see a small group of humans emerging from hiding. They were clearly wary of me, but desperation seemed to outweigh their fear.\n\nOne of them, a female with fierce eyes, approached me cautiously. \"You're not from here,\" she stated, her voice a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.\n\nI shook my head, trying to recall more of their language. \"No. I... came to study. But now... trapped. Like you.\"\n\nThe woman exchanged glances with her companions before turning back to me. \"The machines... they're not just content with Earth anymore. We've seen them building something. Something big.\"\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as I realized the implications. These machines weren't just conquering this planet – they were preparing to expand their reach to the stars.\n\nThe woman extended her hand, a gesture I recognized as a sign of alliance from my research. \"We have a plan,\" she said, her eyes glinting with determination. \"But we need help. Your technology, combined with what we've learned about the machines... we might have a chance.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, weighing my options. My mission, my dreams of scientific glory – all of that seemed trivial now in the face of this threat. I took her hand, sealing our unlikely alliance.\n\n\"I'm Drex,\" I said, my voice firm with newfound resolve. \"And I believe we have a common enemy.\"\n\nAs we made our way to their hidden base, I couldn't help but marvel at the resilience of these humans.

{"id": "text_completion_005", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Saadou, a 37-year-old man hailing from the northeast, traversed his homeland, bound for the forested northern province of a neighboring West African country. His purpose? To sell his herd of 75 cows, accompanied by Tegedantay, a five-year-old girl, and Sulieman, a 10-year-old boy.\n\nThe trio faced the task of crossing a murky river to access the northern province. Their vessel, a sizable raft ferry propelled by an outboard motor, was crafted from securely bound wooden logs, connected with robust nautical ropes.\nOn the opposite bank, awaited two prominent cow traders—Ailemu and Shaiku—anticipating their arrival. Ailemu, with wide eyes and a pot belly, possessed an insatiable drive for profit, willing to engage in business with anyone offering cows for sale, be it 10 or just a lone sickly cow. Ailemu inherited the family cow business, combining his father\"s teachings with a tenacious work ethic. In under two years, despite not knowing how to write his own name, he expanded the enterprise from 15 cows and 27 acres to a staggering 350 cows and over 1000 hectares of land.\nShiaku, a short and stout man with hardly any neck, also inherited the family cow business and rapidly grew it to an admirable 300 cows operation and more than 1000 hectares farm estate, complete with other livestock such as goats and chickens as well as a highly sought after view of the mountains. Having completed secondary schooling, Shaiku focused on securing the most substantial deals or engaging with significant sellers to meet his annual quota of 50 cows. \"Smart work and not hard work,\" a motto he preached to the 30 men under his employment.\nIn the northern province, buying or selling cows inevitably involved dealing with either Ailemu or Shaiku, who dominated the province completely. Thus, a fierce rivalry extended not only between the two traders but also among their respective teams of workers. While public interactions adhered to pleasantries—as custom dictates—between the duo, behind the scenes, workers often endured screechees of \"that fat illiterate rat\" or \"no neck fool\" when a deal slipped through to the opposing party.\n**On the eve** before Saadou, Tegedantay, Sulieman, and their cattle were set to reach the river crossing, Ailemu and Shiaku meticulously briefed their seasoned salesmen, Abu and Ibrahim, on the art of persuasion. The tall and slender herder\"s imminent arrival had been the talk of the town, with scouts and messengers providing detailed insights two weeks prior. Reports raved about the cows\" robust size, their smooth and well-fed appearance, and their ease of rumination when at rest.\nThat evening over dinner with his wife and four children, Ailemu could barely contain his excitement for the potential deal that was about to arrive at his doorstep tomorrow. \"This one is the big one!\" he repeatedly shouted over dinner. The plan was for Abu to handle the negotiations, as he had done countless times before with other herdsmen. However, as the night wore on, Ailemu\"s unease grew. This deal was no ordinary deal like the many others Abu had closed for him; it's a deal that required his special attention and \"hard-work hands\" in order to ensure a favorable outcome. The reports about the 75 cows from his scouts and messengers were more than encouraging—reports he hadn\"t heard describing a cattle herd not since his father\"s time.\nThus, two hours past midnight on the day of the deal, Ailemu, forsaking sleep, rose from his comfortable bed, careful not to disturb his deep-sleeping wife. He promptly dispatched messages to Abu and alerted his house girls to have his favorite gown pressed and ready by Fajr along with a gleaming white babouche, part of his many collections (of various colors) sourced from the finest Moroccan merchants.\n**The morning unfolded** with an unusual dreariness, a mild fog shrouding the surroundings. Shiaku's salesman, Ibrahim, strained his eyes against the river\"s mist, discerning shadowy figures and large four legged beasts on the other side. Having skipped breakfast after the first light of dawn, he had arrived early, eager to meet the man who had been the subject of his boss\"s fascination for weeks. Ibrahim had closed many deals for Shiaku before and was a trusted confidant due to having an eye for the \"smart deals\"\" and quickly fulfilling the 50 cows quota early on in the year, giving his boss time to focus on other matters which range from spending more quality time with his two sons and daughter to tending to livestock on his farm estate.\nOverlooking the shore on a hard muddy hill, Ibrahim placed his hand above his eyes and squinted like an explorer looking for land. \"That's them.\" Coming out of the fog and gliding ever closer to the northern province shore were 25 cows (according to Ibrahim's count) and a gangly boy holding the hand of a short pudgy little girl. Upon seeing the 25 cows, Ibrahim's heart raced and then he remembered that the raft ferry was only so big enough to hold 50 human occupants at a time.\nAfter the two children and 25 cows landed and got off on the shore, the ferryman, without hesitation, turned around his raft ferry and disappeared back into the fog. Couple minutes passed and another 25 cows were seen from the fog before being dropped off on shore with the two children. Another couple minutes later and all the cows were safely on shore. Seeing the cattle for himself, Ibrahim licked his lips as he kept counting and recounting each cow one by one. They were definitely the biggest cows he had seen in all his past dealings. Even better, none of them appeared sick or old for that matter as each was able to sit, stand and move around rather gracefully.\nThe last occupant to emerge from the fog and arrive on shore was Saadou, donning a black gown. Ibrahim got a clear look at the light-skinned and pony-tailed cattle herder everybody was raving about. True, he was tall—just as the scouts and messengers described — but not skinny, at least not by Ibrahim's standards. Eying the cattle herder as he organized his herd, Ibrahim expected the man to be much skinnier, and certainly should not have broad shoulders and muscular arms at that. In fact, the only thing skinny about the man was his long and lanky legs, barely covered by loose black trousers that stopped far short of the ankles.\n\"Where's that big head?\" Ibrahim murmurmered. Noon was approaching and he had not seen any signs of Abu. He loved the feeling of winning deals over Abu. Throughout the years, they engaged in back and forth battles on who could win the most deals over the other: battles when tallied altogether would likely show an even score. Unlike their bosses, they were not shy to hurl insults directly at one another when jostling to entice herders to relinquish their precious commodities at a favorable price. \"Big head asshole!\" \"Black bastard!\" Some of the favorite insults of choice that could be heard all along the river's shore, in addition to hisses and teeth-sucking.\nIbrahim felt a hand on his right shoulder. \"Ah, I thought you were too scared to come, big head. Afraid I am going to whip you again.\"\n\"Never afraid, Ibrahima,\" said the bassy voice.\nIbrahim froze for a moment, feeling the coolness of the sweat running down from his forehead and armpits. He without a doubt recognized the voice but questioned why he was hearing it: at the river of all places.\n\"What?\" the voice said. \"Eh, you not going to look at me?\"\nIbrahim turned around slowly, hoping that if he moved carefully enough, the voice would vanish and he would once again see the familiar forehead he'd been accustomed to seeing at the river all these years. \"Sorry…sa,\" Ibrahim said, sounding defeated as his eyes settled on the fat face and big grin of his boss' longtime rival. There were four houseboys who stood behind him.\n\"Ibrahima, you look not well,\" Ailemu said, wearing a creaseless bright white gown and kufi hat. \"Do you want me to send you to my doctor?\"\n\"No…sa,\" Ibrahim said, caressing his sweaty forehead. \"I thought…Abu—\"\n\"Change of the fate, my son. I will be taking over for Abu.\" Ailemu walked past Ibrahim—followed by his 4 houseboys—and stood at the edge of the hill, rubbing his hands and salivating at all he had been waiting for the past 3 weeks. \"So this is the big one, eh… Mashallah.\"\nIbrahim heard his stomach growling with impatience. It had been growling all morning since arriving at the river but his sales tactic (practiced over and over with Shaiku in the night's prior) to close the deal along with excitement to beat Abu had kept his mind preoccupied. Now, with the thought of having to outmaneuver Ailemu, Ibrahim wished he had listened to his nagging wife and ate something before leaving home. He never competed with Ailemu before on a deal. Matter of fact, he did not remember ever seeing Ailemu at the river; it was always his \"big head\" and short salesman negotiating and closing deals on his behalf. Still, he had heard stories (lots of stories) about the \"big belly man\" and his callous way of doing business from not only his boss but also from other smaller cow traders. \"Getting in the middle of Ailemu and money is like being in middle of a wolf and a sick sheep,\" as bluntly put by a small inland trader who insisted on a private conversation.\n\"Ibrahima, come my son,\" the voice beckoned, its resonance cutting through the air.\nLike a doomed sailor answering the call of a siren, Ibrahim walked with heavy steps towards the voice. When he finally (and reluctantly) made it to the edge of the hill, a blubbery hand wrapped around and covered him like a robe.\n\"Don't worry about Shaiku,\" Ailemu said, pulling Ibrahim closer. He reached inside his big gown, pulled out and plopped a bundle of cash—folded and tied up in a rubber band—on the man's thumping chest. \"Take this and if he throws you out because of today, come to me. You don't need to lie. Tell him it was me, not Abu. You are a good seller, Ibrahima. Allah knows I'm grateful to those who help me.\" Ailemu released Ibrahim, who bent his head down, took his earnings for the day and scurried away.\nWith the competition out of the way, Ailemu shifted his attention to the impending transaction.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The continuation of the story:\n\nAs Ailemu descended the hill, his eyes fixed on Saadou and the impressive herd, he felt a surge of anticipation. This was the moment he had been waiting for, and he was determined to secure this deal at any cost.\n\nSaadou, noticing the approaching figure, straightened his posture and gently nudged Tegedantay and Sulieman behind him. He had heard stories of the two rival traders who controlled the northern province's cattle market, and he knew that the negotiations ahead would be crucial.\n\n\"As-salaam-alaikum,\" Ailemu called out, his voice booming across the shore. \"Welcome to our humble province, my friend. I am Ailemu, and I've been eagerly awaiting your arrival.\"\n\nSaadou nodded respectfully, \"Wa-alaikum-salaam. I am Saadou, and these are my young companions, Tegedantay and Sulieman.\"\n\nAilemu's eyes darted briefly to the children before returning to Saadou. \"Ah, starting them young in the trade, I see. Very wise.\" He then gestured towards the cattle. \"I must say, the reports about your herd were not exaggerated. They are truly magnificent beasts.\"\n\nSaadou allowed himself a small smile of pride. \"Thank you. They have been well-cared for on our journey.\"\n\nAs they began to discuss the potential sale, Ailemu's houseboys fanned out, examining the cattle more closely. They murmured appreciatively, further fueling Ailemu's determination to close the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Shaiku's compound, Ibrahim arrived, his heart heavy with the weight of his betrayal. He found Shaiku pacing in his office, clearly agitated.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" Shaiku demanded. \"And where are the cows? Don't tell me that rat Ailemu beat us to it!\"\n\nIbrahim, his voice trembling, recounted the morning's events. As he spoke, Shaiku's face darkened with rage.\n\n\"That conniving, illiterate swine!\" Shaiku roared, slamming his fist on the desk. \"He thinks he can just waltz in and take what's rightfully mine?\"\n\nWithout another word, Shaiku stormed out of his office, calling for his driver. He was determined to intervene before Ailemu could seal the deal.\n\nBack at the shore, negotiations were well underway. Ailemu, true to his reputation, was proving to be a shrewd and persistent negotiator. He employed every trick in his arsenal, from flattery to veiled threats, trying to drive down Saadou's asking price.\n\nSaadou, however, was no novice to such tactics. He stood his ground, calmly countering each of Ailemu's arguments with logic and patience. The children watched wide-eyed, absorbing the intricacies of the high-stakes negotiation.\n\nAs the sun climbed higher in the sky, tensions rose. Ailemu, growing frustrated with Saadou's resilience, was about to make a final offer when the sound of screeching tires interrupted them.\n\nShaiku's car skidded to a halt at the top of the hill, and the short, stout man practically tumbled out, his face red with exertion and anger.\n\n\"Ailemu!\" he bellowed, his voice carrying across the shore. \"You backstabbing weasel! How dare you try to steal my deal!\"\n\nAilemu's face contorted with annoyance. \"Your deal? I don't see your name on these cows, Shaiku. This is business, and I got here first.\"\n\nAs the two rivals faced off, hurling insults and accusations at each other, Saadou quietly ushered Tegedantay and Sulieman a few steps back. He observed the unfolding drama with a mixture of amusement and concern.\n\nThe commotion attracted the attention of other locals, who gathered at a safe distance to watch the spectacle. Some even began taking bets on which of the two traders would emerge victorious.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Saadou noticed something that the others had overlooked. A group of men, strangers to the area, were slowly making their way towards the herd. Their furtive glances and purposeful movements set off alarm bells in Saadou's mind.\n\nAs Ailemu and Shaiku continued their heated argument, oblivious to their surroundings, Saadou quietly instructed Tegedantay and Sulieman to start gathering the cows. Years of herding had honed his instincts, and right now, those instincts were screaming danger.\n\nJust as the strange men were about to reach the herd, Saadou let out a sharp whistle. The cows, accustomed to his commands, immediately began to move, forming a tight circle around the children.\n\nThe sudden movement caught everyone's attention. Ailemu and Shaiku ceased their bickering, turning to see what was happening. The would-be cattle rustlers, realizing their cover was blown, broke into a run.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Saadou's quick thinking and the loyalty of his herd prevented what could have been a disastrous theft. The local authorities, attracted by the commotion, arrived on the scene and apprehended the would-be thieves.\n\nAs the dust settled, Ailemu and Shaiku stood side by side, looking sheepish. The reality of how their petty rivalry had nearly cost them both a valuable deal – and potentially put lives at risk – began to sink in.\n\nSaadou, having ensured the safety of his herd and the children, approached the two traders. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, his voice calm but firm, \"I came here to sell my cattle, not to witness a spectacle or be the victim of theft. If you're both interested in doing business, I suggest we start over – this time, with respect and honesty.\"\n\nAilemu and Shaiku exchanged glances, a silent understanding passing between them. They had let their competition blind them to the true essence of their trade – building relationships and conducting fair business.\n\n\"You're right,\" Ailemu said, extending his hand to Shaiku. \"We've been fools.\"\n\nShaiku nodded, accepting the handshake. \"Indeed. Perhaps it's time we learned to work together, rather than against each other.\"\n\nWith the air cleared, the three men sat down to negotiate. This time, the discussion was marked by mutual respect and fair consideration. As the sun began to set, a deal was struck that satisfied all parties.\n\nAs Saadou prepared to leave with his payment, having sold his herd for a fair price, he turned to Tegedantay and Sulieman. \"Remember this day,\" he said softly. \"In business, as in life, integrity and wisdom are worth more than any amount of money.\"\n\nThe children nodded solemnly, their young minds forever marked by the lessons of that eventful day. As they walked away, Ailemu and Shaiku watched them go, a new respect dawning in their eyes – not just for Saadou, but for the age-old wisdom of the herders who had long roamed these lands.\n\nAnd so, as night fell over the northern province, a new chapter began – one of cooperation rather than competition, of wisdom over greed, and of the enduring spirit of those who live by the ancient rhythms of the land and its beasts.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text.

{"id": "text_completion_006", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The pungent odor of the sea hit Julwei first as she snapped awake. The familiar mix of old fish and gull burned her nostrils. The throbbing pain in her skull came next. Her back and shoulders burned with pain but, judging from the chill that worked down her back, nothing important was broken.\n\n\nJulwei pushed herself to her feet. Wood and cloth and silver spicefish littered the dented cooling plate around her. The familiar buzz of a nearby arc core — the power source for the plate, of course — ran along her arms. She spared a glance to the man whose stall she ruined.\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\nThe islander crossed his arms and narrowed his grey eyes in response.\n\n\"Fair enough.\" Julwei shrugged. \"You see a lizard? Green scales, tall, strong.\"\n\nHe pointed through a hole in the yellow canopy, a hole, she was sure, recently added when Julwei fell from the cliff above. She scanned the cliff. No sign of the lizardfolk who threw her down.\n\n\"You sure he didn't follow me down?\"\n\nThe man offered no response.\n\n\"You know where he went?\"\n\nStill nothing.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nPulling her black hair out of her face, Julwei nodded a farewell. She thought, for a moment, that the vendor may try to stop her. She had destroyed his shop, technically. He would be justified. But he only grumbled at her as she passed. Perhaps he saw some kinship in her brown eyes. He recognized her as one of his own. If not from this town — this island — another nearby.\n\nOr perhaps he feared the gun hanging from her hip.\n\nRaising a hand to block the sun, she scanned the town. Osprey was a small port, compared to those that dotted the coast of the kingdom, but not empty. It sat several days off the fastest trade routes, protected from intruders by storms, coral reefs, and sandbanks. Only small ships could safely navigate to the harbor, and most preferred to row in. Yet enough managed to make the journey to turn the island into one of the few trading hubs outside kingdom control. Unofficially, the kingdom deemed Osprey a lost cause and left it to pirates, rebels, and other lowlifes.\n\nOfficially, it didn't exist.\n\nThe cliffs shielded half of Osprey from the vengeful sun and colorful tarps made of flora cloth protected the rest. They were strung together between leaning multi-storey wooden structures and poles painted in pastels. The port was mostly cobbled together from the wood of half sunk ships. Only a faint suggestion of the island's original architecture remained.\n\nJulwei watched the crowd as she made her way to the coast. Islanders, kingdom escapees, and even the occasional mekanica filled the port, but her bounty was nowhere in sight. Under different circumstances, she would be impressed how a creature with scales and a tail could disappear in a place smaller than a kingdom galleon. Even in the islands, lizardfolk were uncommon. The few she did see didn't match his height or coloring.\n\nHer body ached with every step, a constant painful reminder of who she was hunting. Nothing compared to the pulsing in her head. At the moment, Julwei wanted nothing more than a warm bath and healing salve, but she couldn't wait. She spent a month tracking the lizardfolk to Osprey. Allowing him to escape wasn't an option.\n\nIf she was lucky, he slipped back into the jungle and fell prey to the island. If she was unlucky, he retreated and set another trap.\n\nEither way, she still needed proof.\n\nThe beach had no shade and the sun burned Julwei's skin as she stepped into the sea. Everything on the islands was warmer. Even the water felt pleasant against her skin, except for the salt in her wounds, unlike the cold waves in the mainland. Were it not for the bounty or her debts, she might not return to the kingdom.\n\nEven with the debts, she was tempted to stay.\n\nJulwei knelt in the water for a moment, collecting herself. The waves pushed against her with an easy, lazy rhythm. The backwash carved grooves under her knees and boots. Salt stung the cuts she didn't even know she had. A curious scuttler inched dangerously close, snapping its pincers as a threat, but even the mere act of flicking it away seemed like too much work. Her next encounter with the lizardfolk would require a more careful approach. He was too strong to risk a direct fight, especially without taking time to recover and treat her injuries. Time she couldn't afford.\n\nClosing her eyes, Julwei focused her mind on the bounty, calling forth an image of the lizardfolk. It was easier now that she had seen his face in person. The drawing from the bounty office didn't show his scales were green or the way the split in his lip widened when he snarled. His teeth weren't as sharp or long and a few were missing, no doubt knocked loose in a bar fight after he defected. Lizardfolk wore age differently than humans, but he looked older. Not significantly, but whoever described him remembered someone young.\n\nThe drawings showed his eyes dark and full of malice. The artist depicted him as the villain the kingdom proclaimed.\n\nHis eyes were yellow and afraid.\n\nJulwei pictured the lizard as he was before he threw her from the cliff. Afraid but violent. Easily tossing her with one arm, the other tight on his satchel, roaring in fury. She pictured every scar, every tooth, each of the tiny spurs on his jaw and scalp, and held that image in her mind as she submerged herself.\n\nThen she took a breath.\n\nHer lungs screamed as she swallowed the salty water. Her body forgot the pain in her head and on her limbs. All she could feel was fire in her chest. Every sane part of her body urged her to surface, but Julwei focused her thoughts only on the lizardfolk. She pushed herself deeper into the sea, even as the darkness creeped into the corners of her mind, teasing her with death.\n\nSome called it magic. Others sorcery, the ether, witchcraft, the cold, and many other words for the space between life and death. Few could reach it and many that could passed too far into death. The ether was power. Uncontrollable without luck or training, but power on the same. By the laws of the kingdom, witchcraft was outlawed. The problem often took care of itself but, when deemed necessary, the kingdom punished witches with ruthless efficiency.\n\nThere were exceptions. Hushed whispers spread in dark corners of the kingdom. Rumors of strange powers used by the kingdom's own enforcers — inquisitors, a dying breed of an ancient order. Rumors spread too of wealthy officials and particularly lucky gamblers, but neither seemed worthy of an inquisitor's time. The kingdom overlooked Julwei for reasons she didn't understand and didn't question. She felt the familiar chill from enough of her contracts to know the kingdom's blind eye was a privilege, not a right.\n\nThey would come for her someday. She only hoped to die before then.\n\nAs the last of her strength waned away, the world came into a new focus. Shadows shifted into smoky images painted in muted colors that turned to junglewood and stone. The smell of earth and ash filled her nose. The sounds of birds and panthers and other beasts echoed around her. Her vision sharpened and her eyes focused on a broken pyramid deep within the island.\n\nHer bounty hadn't fled.\n\nJulwei broke the surface, gasping for fair, and flailed wildly until the water was shallow enough for to pull herself away. Every breath stung. Between each, she purged the water from her lungs. But she could breathe. She was alive. Most importantly, the shortcut worked. She found her bounty.\n\nBy the time the sun dipped beyond the horizon — its last golden rays painting the sky in shades of orange — Julwei was deep in the jungle. Her head and lungs hadn't forgiven her yet, but impatience won out. She limped along the narrow trail, following the path now seared in her memory. The ether gave her a vague idea of her destination through her bounty's eyes, but the hike wasn't easy and the little aches began to weigh on her. She ignored the concerning noises coming from the canopy, always a creature just out of sight, though she kept her hand on her pistol as a precaution. She couldn't stop until she found shelter.\n\nFortunately, that had been done for her.\n\nThe lizardfolk had found a temple hidden within the island and established a camp. She had a hazy image of the ancient stone and overgrown roots in her mind, but she recognized the patterns carved on the walls. Or her bounty did, at least. She had never seen one before, though stories of similar temples spread throughout the kingdom. Some claimed that a great civilization once conquered the world, stretching beyond even the kingdom's current borders. None could explain how such a great nation could collapse and leave behind nothing but old stone.\n\nAs far as Julwei was concerned, the stepped pyramids of the islands had nothing to do with the ruins in the kingdom or the one found in the colonies. Supposed connections were nothing but delusions by novelists.\n\nYet she felt her pain give way to excitement. She heard stories of great explorers as a child, of dashing adventurers who retrieved relics from the clutches of vile monsters. They ventured deep into the ruins for mysterious artifacts steeped in power. Others told stories of the spirits that still haunted the temples, guarding their homes from intruders, luring them into traps or remnants of magic.\n\nFoolish treasure hunters claimed they stole artifacts from under the nose of kingdom forces. They could rarely make such claims twice.\n\nThe kingdom encouraged rumors. They greatly appreciated the relics and exploration done by treasure hunters, officially sanctioned or not. The reward for a genuine piece of history exceeded any bounty tenfold. To keep things civil, the punishment for any forgery was severe, often death. The king's archivists were not easily fooled.\n\nNot that Julwei needed to worry. Osprey's temple obviously remained undiscovered thus far, otherwise the kingdom's fleet would have already claimed it. No island beast or coral reef was so dangerous a thousand soldiers couldn't best it.\n\nThey might even reward her for its discovery.\n\nThe only obstacle was one lizard. The bounty would be hers. The relics would be hers to sell. And Julwei could find a warm beach to stay.\n\nAssuming he didn't kill her.\n\nDusk turned to night by the time Julwei found the temple. The pyramid peaked above the canopy, a beacon between the twin Dar moons. She felt the air shift as she drew closer. A chill crept under her skin and pulled her closer to the ether. Briefly, Julwei debated her stance on temple ghosts. She found it easier to dismiss them as stories before she felt the cold.\n\nJulwei knew there had been a time when the temple sat over nature, a triumph of its creators, but it was hard to see anything other than a ruin. Much of the original structure lost its centuries-long battle with the surrounding jungle. Only the skeleton remained. Moss and vines covered the structure's stony base. A large tree rose from what had once been a courtyard, surrounded now by rubble. Its large thick roots twisted through the gaps in the stone floor. One entrance collapsed into a pile of rock and wood. Another was blocked by overgrown vines and roots.\n\nThe jungle claimed this land. As it always would.\n\nChecking for traps, Julwei circled the temple. She lacked the enhanced eyesight of her prey, but years of close calls taught her what to look for: a glint of light, a clearing too clean, or a silhouette out of place. She found none of these. She did, however, find her bounty's camp in the courtyard. Chests served as tables for tools, books, and buckets of colorful liquid. He built a lean-to against a decayed all, the roof made of the same floracloth of Osprey's town. A fire pit, dug into the temple itself, was full of ash, but nor embers. For a moment, Julwei thought her witchcraft might have failed her again — there was no sign the bounty here — but she felt the ether pull her inside.\n\nJulwei pulled her pistol from its holster and approached the only unbarred entrance to the temple's interior. She stepped lightly on the stone. Her heart thundered in her chest as the memory of her last encounter with the lizardfolk forced its way to the front of her mind. She would be lucky to survive another fight.\n\nShe considered if her target would still be alive. The jungle hadn't killed either of them yet, but the temple might. She could wait the night outside and leave her bounty to the ghosts. If there was still a body, she would claim it in the morning, under the safety of the sun.\n\nShe waited for another breath, but no ghost showed itself.\n\nThe hairs on her arm stood as she crept down the passage. Moss clung to her as she brushed past and, no matter how hard she tried to brush it away, it stuck. The cold turned her veins to ice. The rhythmic tap of metal on stone echoed through the hall, growing louder as she drew closer.\n\nEventually, the narrow hallway opened to a larger rectangle room. More darkened paths led to dead ends on three of the chamber's four sides, blocked at their ends by nature's power. Two mighty stone pillars supported what remained of the roof. Vines dangled from a hole.\n\nJungle growth covered half of the fourth wall. On the other half was a mural of a man under the waning moon, behind him a pyramid much like the temple she stood in. While the man was only carved into the wall, the pyramid was lined with white and gold. Dar Eon was painted in her lunar blues, her shadows stretching beyond the confines of the wall. On the other side, Julwei could see the beginnings of a mirrored scene, no doubt with the rising twin. Between the murals, a large stone door sat a few steps above the floor.\n\nHer bounty focused on the wall, oblivious to her as she approached. Tapping at the wall with a hammer and chisel, he carved along the ancient grooves, clearing them of moss and age. Scars crossed in patterns on his shoulders and back. His muscles rippled beneath his rough skin as he worked. The bony spurs that lined his jaw and scalp continued down his spine and tail. They were short and sparse, but sharp enough to do some damage in a fight.\n\nHe wore a belt with several knives and an empty holster. His gun, a strange piece with a wide barrel and a leather-wrapped grip, sat on the crate by the base of the steps, surrounded by brushes, chisels, and his discarded shirt. An old lantern lit the room.\n\nThe strange orb next to it caught Julwei's attention.\n\nMarkings similar to the ones engraved around the temple were etched into the metal bands that lazily rotated around the center. The sphere within sat still. Were it not for her connection to the ether, she might have considered it no more than a gyroscope, but she felt the cold around it, denser than the rest of the temple. It was the exact kind of relic chronicler's sought.\n\nIf the lizardfolk knew, he could have traded it for the bounty on his life.\n\nJulwei thumbed the hammer back on her pistol until she heard the click. Her bounty stopped his chiseling. His shoulders tensed. Turning around slowly, he faced Julwei with a sad smile. A pendant hung around his neck. It was inscribed with lettering in a language Julwei could not read, but she knew from others that it was his name, written in a sacred script of a long dead religion.\n\n\"Bounty Hunter,\" the lizard greeted. His voice was soft and scholarly. \"So that was you I smelled.\"\n\nHis eyes darted to his gun. Julwei could see the indecision on his face. Was he fast enough to reach it before she took her shot? If he were to die anyway, could he take her with him? Was there a point to trying?\n\nThe situation was not unfamiliar to her.\n\n\"You do not scare as easy as the others,\" he mused. The tension in his shoulders disappeared. Clearly, he accepted his fate. \"I should have known. I've seen your eyes on others. Brave, all of them. Stupid some. Is there any chance you let me live?\"\n\n\"Afraid not.\"\n\n\"I assumed as much. Do you have a name, Bounty Hunter?\"\n\n\"Julwei.\"\n\n\"I am Seros. I imagine you know this already.\"\n\nJulwei nodded.\n\n\"Did they tell you what I did?\"\n\n\"Didn't ask.\"\n\n\"No. You wouldn't.\" Seros shook his head. \"I can tell you I am innocent.\"\n\n\"I don't care.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't,\" Seros repeated. His gaze turned downward. The lizardfolk was a mass of muscles and scars that towered over her, yet in this moment, he looked fragile. His body was as much a ruin as the temple. As if he could collapse at any moment.\n\nJulwei's grip on her gun loosened.\n\n\"I was a bounty hunter too, once. I served the kingdom, killing who they asked for fifty years. I fought their war — before your time. It is a hard life. I know you know this. We do not have many friends.\" Seros sighed. \"I thought I had one.\"\n\n\"You were betrayed.\"\n\nHe nodded. His movements were slow and methodical. \"I was. I heard secrets not meant for my ears. I made no trouble, but my knowing was enough. My confidant chose the kingdom over me. Decades of service and execution was my reward..\"\n\nSeros took a heavy breath. He trembled as he spoke, obviously pained by the memories, but Julwei understood the way he studied her. The sadness in his eyes was genuine, but he was clever enough to weaponize that, hoping that she would drop her guard and let him close the distance. Had she not already lost one fight, his plan might have succeeded.\n\nJulwei steadied her aim.\n\n\"Before you kill me, nessa, would you like to know the secret?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nJulwei pulled the trigger.\n\nA heartbeat later, Seros still stood. No blood painted the walls. No thunder rang out. Only the thud of the hammer slamming forward and wet gunpowder failing to ignite.\n\nSeros reacted quicker than Julwei. Shifting his weight, he turned on his heel and slammed his thick tail into Julwei's abdomen before leaping for his gun. Her stomach lurched. The pain from the hit quickly faded as she slammed into one of the pillars, smacking her head against the stone. Stars swarmed her vision. The world around her dulled and blurred, but she didn't faint this time. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.\n\nShe had no time to recover. Julwei heard a click and threw herself to the ground. Above her, the stone shattered into dust. Seros\" pistol left a small grouping of holes in the pillar. He cracked the gun open toward the rear of the barrel, ejecting a smoking shell.\n\nJulwei pushed herself to her feet. Her own pistol disappeared into one of the dark corners of the room. Even if she had it in hand, she couldn't clear her pistol and reload before him. She'd be lucky if the rest of her stores of gunpowder were dry.\n\nSeros pulled another cartridge from the pouch on his belt. He took slow confident steps toward Julwei, a stern look on his face, though the corners of his mouth turned up in a slight smile. Relief tempered by the somber role of executioner. The sadness in his eyes never faded. He snapped the weapon closed, thumbing back the hammer, and aimed for her chest.\n\n\"I am sorry it has come to this.\"\n\nIf he were heartless, a shot would have rang through the temple and Julwei would be dead. Instead, the lizardfolk hesitated.\n\nJulwei darted forward and shoved her shoulder into him with all her strength. His eyes widened in surprise at her bravery, though Julwei did little more than knock Seros off balance. Still, she bought time.\n\nJulwei pulled one of the lizardfolk's knives from his belt, slicing across his stomach and chest in one smooth motion. He hissed. Blue blood spilled from the wound, but the cut wasn't deep enough for any lasting damage. Pressing her limited advantage, Julwei stabbed the knife through his wrist. Seros howled in pain, dropping the gun, and pulled away from her. Eyes locked on his movement, Julwei kicked the gun away and raised her fists.\n\n\"Sanessa,\" Seros growled.\n\nJulwei punched him. Her fist connected ineffectively with his stomach. Her knuckles scraped on his scales. Seros returned the blow with a clumsy swing of his good arm, knocking Julwei onto her back. The air escaped her lungs as she hit the ground. Her already bruised muscles screamed in protest. Rolling away, Julwei narrowly dodged his kick, and she found her footing before he could do more.\n\nSeros lumbered toward her. His smile faded and eyes hardened. Relief and regret both twisted into anger. The floor shuddered with every step. Julwei glanced around for a weapon, wishing now she had stolen his gun or a second knife. With only her fists, she was more likely to break her own hand than hurt him. Her options were limited.\n\nShe knew how this would end.\n\nSeros grabbed Julwei, lifting her by her shirt with one arm. He ignored her futile struggles as he pinned her against the pillar. Something cracked, stone or bone, Julwei wasn't sure. She brought her shin to his groin with enough force to topple any man, but the lizard only grunted. He pressed his arm against her throat. The knife remained embedded in his wrist. Julwei flinched as the icy blood dripped onto her shoulder. Leaning in close, Seros hissed at her, showing too many sharp teeth.\n\n\"I asked for mercy, Bounty Hunter. This could have ended differently.\"\n\nJulwei pushed against the pressure on her throat with one hand, trying to grab another knife from the lizardfolk's belt with the other. Failing that, she searched her pockets in a desperate attempt to find anything of value. Her hand closed on a collection of damp paper wads.\n\nShe shoved the fistful into Seros' face, cutting a packet open on one of the bony spurs on his cheek, and rubbed the damp gunpowder into his eyes. He growled and released his grip just enough for her to bring air back into her lungs. Yanking the knife from his wrist, she plunged it into his side, unleashing a flood of cold blood and a howl of pain.\n\nJulwei pushed away from, wincing as she hit the stone again. Blindly lashing out, Seros kicked at her, following the attack with a swipe from his tail. The floor shattered beneath his steps as Julwei dodged the strikes. Shards of rock bit her arms and chest. Scrambling away, Julwei put as much distance between them as she could.\n\nThe bounty, she decided, was underpriced.\n\nHer hand closed around the wooden grip of a gun. Not hers. Too heavy and wide. Julwei spun and pulled the trigger. She didn't have time to aim. A deafening sound burst from the gun and her arm nearly sprung from its socket. Only practice and fear let her keep her grip on the weapon. The recoil left her exposed, open to retaliation. She had to hope she didn't miss.\n\nShe didn't.\n\nThe shot went low and a little wide, hitting Seros in the gut on the opposite side of the knife. Blood poured from the wound. The pellets embedded in his stomach and a wide hole went through what used to be a vital organ. Some shrapnel hit his damaged arm. His hand was limp as he pressed it to his side.\n\nSeros stumbled back until he was leaning on the wall then sunk to the floor, leaving behind a bloody streak on the moss. His yellow eyes were wide with shock. Julwei had seen the scared look many times before, though it never grew easier to bear.\n\nIn their final moments, all feared death.\n\nJulwei approached with caution, pausing only to retrieve Seros' belt from the floor. Her shot ruined the leather and buckle, so she slung it over her shoulder. Seros drooped his head, giving up the fight. For a moment, there was silence. Each challenging the other to speak.\n\nSeros gave in sooner.\n\n\"They will come for you too,\" he said. His voice was weak and made small by the vastness of the room. The lizardfolk coughed blood, sprinkling droplets on the floor between them. His dull green scales had all but disappeared beneath the blue stains.\n\n\"Likely.\"\n\nJulwei ejected the spent cartridge from the gun. Seros' weapon was unlike any she used before, but it felt natural in her hand. Locking in another round, she raised the gun at him, careful to stay out of reach of his tail.\n\nSeros locked his eyes to hers. \"This is a mistake, nessa.\"\n\n\"Not the first time I've heard that.\" Julwei pulled back the hammer. \"Won't be the last. Anything else?\"\n\nSeros glared at her. He moved his fingers to the knife, wincing as he touched the hilt. A gurgling sound followed as he freed it from his side. Julwei tensed. Even with an open wound, even with a mangled arm, he worried her. She knew he couldn't hit her before she fired; his wounds were too severe. Still, she took a step back.\n\n\"Jenai.\" He brought the knife to his neck and cut his necklace free. He held it tight in his good hand. \"That is my secret. Jenai is our hope.\"\n\nFinally, after a lengthy sigh, he nodded to her.\n\nThe weapon barked. The wall behind Seros erupted into splinters and what was left of the lizardfolk's broken body slumped over, blood and gore spilling onto the floor. Julwei flinched at the surge of cold that followed as his spirit crossed the ether.\n\nSeros was dead.\n\nThe bounty was complete.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story:\n\nJulwei lowered the gun, her hands shaking. The adrenaline that had carried her through the fight began to fade, replaced by a bone-deep weariness. She leaned against the pillar, sliding down until she sat on the cold stone floor. Her body ached, and she could feel new bruises forming atop the old.\n\nFor a long moment, she simply breathed, letting the reality of her situation sink in. The bounty was complete, but at what cost? She glanced at Seros' body, a pang of regret twisting in her gut. His last words echoed in her mind: \"Jenai is our hope.\"\n\nShe didn't know what it meant, but she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd stumbled into something far bigger than a simple bounty.\n\nWith a groan, Julwei pushed herself to her feet. She had work to do. First, she searched Seros' body, retrieving anything of value. The pendant with his name went into her pocket – proof of the kill. She hesitated over the knife he'd used to cut it free, then took that too. It was a fine weapon, and she'd lost hers in the fight.\n\nNext, she turned her attention to the camp outside. The chests yielded a mix of supplies, tools, and a few items that might fetch a good price. But it was the strange orb that drew her eye again. She picked it up, feeling its weight in her hands. The metal bands continued their lazy rotation, and the chill of the ether seemed to intensify around it.\n\n\"What were you doing here, Seros?\" she murmured, studying the artifact. \"What did you find?\"\n\nAs if in answer, a faint humming began to emanate from the orb. The bands spun faster, and the sphere at its center began to glow with an eerie blue light. Startled, Julwei nearly dropped it, but something compelled her to hold on.\n\nImages flashed through her mind – a vast city of impossible architecture, creatures that defied description, and at the center of it all, a woman with eyes that burned like stars. Jenai.\n\nThe vision ended as abruptly as it began, leaving Julwei gasping. She stared at the orb, which had returned to its dormant state. Whatever this thing was, it was powerful. And dangerous.\n\nShe wrapped it carefully in cloth and stowed it in her pack. The kingdom's archivists would pay handsomely for such a relic, but Julwei found herself reluctant to hand it over. Something told her that this artifact was key to understanding Seros' secret – and perhaps to her own survival.\n\nAs dawn broke, Julwei made her way back to Osprey. The journey was slow and painful, her injuries making every step a challenge. But she pushed on, driven by a mix of determination and growing unease.\n\nThe port was stirring to life as she entered, merchants setting up their stalls and early risers heading to the docks. Julwei kept her head down, avoiding eye contact. She needed to get off the island as soon as possible.\n\nAt the harbor, she approached a weathered captain she'd dealt with before. The woman raised an eyebrow at Julwei's battered appearance but asked no questions.\n\n\"I need passage to the mainland,\" Julwei said, her voice rough from exhaustion.\n\nThe captain named her price. It was steep, but fair given the risk of sailing to kingdom-controlled waters. Julwei paid without haggling, using some of the coins she'd taken from Seros' camp.\n\nAs she waited for the ship to prepare, Julwei found a quiet corner and pulled out the pendant. She traced the unfamiliar script with her finger, thinking of Seros' final moments. He'd been right about one thing – the kingdom would come for her eventually. But for now, she had a new mystery to solve.\n\nWho was Jenai? What was the secret Seros had died to protect? And how did it all connect to the strange artifact now hidden in her pack?\n\nJulwei boarded the ship with more questions than answers. As Osprey faded into the distance, she felt a chapter of her life closing. But another was just beginning – one that promised danger, intrigue, and perhaps a chance at redemption.\n\nShe touched the orb through her pack, feeling its chill even through the layers of cloth.

{"id": "text_completion_007", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: All was quiet in Ura city hall. Not even a mouse dared to stir because of the cat Goldtail. He was satisfied with his work and bathed in the sun coming through a window. Much like the relaxed feline, Evelyn was taking a nap on her desk. A bit of drool came out of her mouth and damaged a document about precautions to take in a tornado. When would those be necessary? Becca sat by the front of building in case anyone needed help from the city. It was an uncommon occurrence as most people in Ura could handle themself and realized the mayor was an idiot, but they liked the sheriff and her deputy.\n\n\nDerrick, the deputy in question, was deep in the library reading one of the few remaining fiction books again. This was a book published in 1924, and it told the tale of a lone cowboy fighting a group of pirates. It made little sense, and the prose was awful. The book was still moderately enjoyable and passed the time well. Nearby, Larry was reading rules and regulations determined how to escape captivity as the town mime.\n\nThe silence was held in tact as a group of three people snuck into the library. They crouched behind the bookshelves and moved through the stacks. One person slipped on a book and fell flat on their face unleashing a thud. Derrick ignored the noise while Larry went to check it out. When Larry saw the people, he opened his mouth to scream, but a sound didn't escape his mouth. He was committed to the role. He ran out of the library to get help.\n\nDerrick stayed in his spot reading his book. He had reached the chapter where the cowboy was about to spring a trap on the pirates with gold from the mines. A knife was on his neck before he could finish which was a rude way to interrupt someone.\n\n\"Come with us.\" The knife-wielder had a nasally voice. Derrick sighed and placed the book to the side. He placed his arms behind his back.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the knife-wielder asked.\n\n\"Aren't you going to restrain me?\"\n\n\"Uh, we don't have ropes.\" The knife-wielder looked to his group who shrugged. \"We should've brought that. Why don't you two just grab one hand each and walk out with him.\" The two kidnappers did as they were told. Derrick found this arrangement more comfortable.\n\n\"Could you pick up my book? I was getting to the good part,\" Derrick asked.\n\n\"Sure.\" The knife-wielder bent over and picked up. Derrick was escorted by the kidnappers who held his hand while they walked.\n\nEvelyn's office was the closest to the library. Larry ran in there and began to point outside. He gesticulated wildly with his arm indicating knife and then held his hands behind his back. Evelyn remained asleep. Larry waved his hands before her to wake her up, but she stayed rested. Larry rolled his eyes and moved on to his next target. While the front hall was empty, Becca stayed alert. She kept one eye at the door and another at the crossword puzzle she found. This crossword was from twenty years before the war which made it more challenging, but she would solve it. Her intellectual pursuit was interrupted by a glove hand. Becca looked up to see Larry's face.\n\n\"Could you go ask Derrick? I'm busy here,\" she said. Larry slapped his hand with his face. He considered breaking his vow and saying what happened, but that would break regulation. Such a transgression was unforgivable. He waved his hand before her again.\n\n\"In a minute,\" she said. Larry slammed his fist on the table before her. Becca looked up.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked. Larry began to mime reading a book and sighing. He looked up from the book with a sour face. \"Derrick.\" Becca said. Larry held a finger up to his neck; then, he put his hands behind his back. Becca tilted her head in confusion. Larry scratched his chin for a moment. He grabbed Becca's handcuffs and put them on his own hands. \"Oh my god, he's been kidnapped.\" Becca ran to Evelyn leaving Larry with the handcuffs on.\n\nWhen Becca found Evelyn asleep, she first tried to push Evelyn awake gently. When it became clear that wasn't going to work, Becca removed the paper from underneath her and rolled it up. After hesitating over whether it was the right thing to do, Becca whacked Evelyn with the paper. Evelyn shot up.\n\n\"It was Becca's fault,\" she shouted.\n\n\"I'm right here,\" Becca said.\n\n\"Exactly whatever it was you did it.\"\n\n\"I didn't kidnap Derrick,\" Becca said. Evelyn leaned back and scanned Becca.\n\n\"Becca, you don't treat your employees that way,\" Evelyn replied. Becca shook her head.\n\n\"No, Derrick has been kidnapped, and I need your help to find him,\" Becca said. Larry ran into the room waving his arms trying to get her to remove the handcuffs. \"Not now.\"\n\n\"Why do you need me? You're the sheriff.\"\n\n\"I need backup. Also, if you help me, I'll make your lunch for a week.\"\n\n\"You already make my lunch.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure to include cornbread in your lunch going forward.\"\n\n\"Deal.\" Evelyn walked outside her office. \"Come on. I know he always lounges in the library so there must be clues there.\"\n\nThe noise woke Goldtail up. He looked up at Larry struggling to get the handcuffs off and was amused. Goldtail could use his inherent feline escape abilities to assist the mime, but this was more entertaining. Besides, clouds were gathering outside ruining his sun; he needed something to keep him entertained.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The continuation of the story:\n\nAs Evelyn and Becca rushed to the library, they found it eerily quiet. Books were scattered on the floor, and Derrick's favorite chair was empty. Evelyn picked up a book lying face-down on the floor.\n\n\"Look,\" she said, holding up the book. \"It's that awful cowboy versus pirates novel Derrick loves. He'd never leave this behind willingly.\"\n\nBecca nodded, her face grim. \"We need to act fast. Any ideas where they might have taken him?\"\n\nEvelyn scratched her head. \"Well, there's that abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. It's been empty since the war, and it's the perfect hideout for nefarious activities.\"\n\n\"Good thinking,\" Becca said, impressed. \"Let's go.\"\n\nAs they headed out, they passed Larry, still struggling with the handcuffs. Becca sighed and quickly unlocked them. \"Sorry about that. We need your help. Can you keep an eye on things here while we're gone?\"\n\nLarry nodded enthusiastically, then mimed locking his lips and throwing away the key.\n\nMeanwhile, Derrick found himself in the back of a rusty van, sandwiched between two of his kidnappers. The third, the knife-wielder, was driving.\n\n\"So,\" Derrick said casually, \"mind telling me what this is all about?\"\n\nThe knife-wielder glanced back. \"We need information about Ura's defenses. Word is, you're the smartest person in town.\"\n\nDerrick couldn't help but feel a little flattered. \"Well, I do read a lot. But why do you need to know about our defenses?\"\n\n\"Let's just say there are some interested parties who'd like to... acquire Ura's resources.\"\n\nDerrick's mind raced. Ura didn't have many resources to speak of, unless... \"You're after the library's collection of pre-war books, aren't you?\"\n\nThe kidnappers exchanged surprised glances. \"How did you know?\" one asked.\n\n\"It's the only thing of value we have,\" Derrick shrugged. \"But I have to warn you, those books are protected by something far more dangerous than any defense system.\"\n\nThe knife-wielder scoffed. \"What? That incompetent mayor? The sleepy sheriff?\"\n\n\"No,\" Derrick said solemnly. \"Goldtail.\"\n\nBack at city hall, Goldtail's ears perked up. Something was amiss, and it wasn't just the lack of sunlight. He stretched lazily and padded out of the office, passing Larry, who was diligently guarding the entrance while occasionally checking his reflection in the window to ensure his mime makeup was still perfect.\n\nGoldtail sniffed the air and caught a whiff of something familiar – Derrick's scent, mixed with the smell of strangers. His whiskers twitched with determination. No one messed with his humans, especially not the one who always scratched behind his ears just right.\n\nAs Evelyn and Becca approached the warehouse in Evelyn's beat-up pickup truck, they saw the kidnappers' van parked outside.\n\n\"What's the plan?\" Evelyn whispered.\n\nBecca thought for a moment. \"I'll go in the front, you circle around back. We'll catch them by surprise.\"\n\nEvelyn nodded, then paused. \"Wait, shouldn't I go in the front? I am the mayor, after all.\"\n\nBecca sighed. \"Fine, but be careful.\"\n\nInside the warehouse, Derrick was regaling his captors with tales of Goldtail's legendary feats. \"...and that's how Goldtail single-handedly defeated a pack of mutant rats that tried to invade the library.\"\n\nThe kidnappers listened, transfixed and increasingly nervous. \"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea,\" one muttered.\n\nSuddenly, the warehouse door burst open. \"Freeze!\" Evelyn shouted, holding up a stapler she'd grabbed from her office. \"Um, I mean, this is a gun! Definitely a gun!\"\n\nThe kidnappers jumped to their feet, reaching for their weapons. But before anyone could react, a golden blur streaked through the open door. Goldtail had arrived.\n\nWith lightning speed and feline grace, Goldtail launched himself at the kidnappers. He clawed, bit, and hissed, becoming a whirlwind of fur and fury. The kidnappers, caught off guard by the feline assault, stumbled and fell over each other in their panic.\n\nBecca rushed in from the back, quickly subduing the disoriented kidnappers. Derrick calmly stood up, brushing off his clothes. \"Took you long enough,\" he said with a smirk.\n\nAs they led the kidnappers out, Evelyn turned to Goldtail, who was now calmly licking his paw. \"Good job, Goldtail. I think you've earned an extra serving of tuna tonight.\"\n\nGoldtail meowed in agreement, then sauntered over to Derrick, demanding his well-deserved ear scratch.\n\nBack at city hall, Larry greeted them with an enthusiastic mime routine that somehow conveyed both relief and confusion about what had transpired.\n\nAs things settled down, Derrick picked up his cowboy versus pirates novel. \"You know,\" he mused, \"I think I have an idea for a new story. How about 'The Adventures of Goldtail: Feline Defender of Ura'?\"\n\nGoldtail purred his approval, already anticipating his next heroic adventure – right after his nap in the sunbeam, of course.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

The sudden impact of the sound catches her off guard, and she jerks ever so subtly, dousing her knuckles and the granite beneath with black coffee. Were it not for the fact that the coffee cup had been sitting undisturbed for 45 minutes, it would have certainly burned her hands when the liquid splashed over, but as so many things have before, it had gotten away from her. It was a Saturday, her one day out of the office, and while it was true that she wasn't expecting any calls, she should not have been so surprised, because of course, somebody always needed something. On any other day, this wouldn\"t be troubling, but today, it is. In this instance, the sound of Adele in the late morning could only mean one thing; somebody had fucked up. Barely registering the coffee stains on her fingers, she taps accept and brings the phone to her ear.\n\n\n\"What is it Allison?\" she asks with a frustration that is as palpable as it is cutting. Allison was her assistant, and she already knows what she was going to hear, but sometimes, you have to let people answer questions you know the answer to, so they feel the gravity on their own lips. There is a pause on the other end, the distinct silence of apprehension, before Allisons timid voice breaks through. \"Hi ma'am, sorry to bother you on your day off, but…\" she trails off, unsure of how to word the coming letdown in a way that would not be her own undoing. Her boss was an intense woman, and this intensity was about to bubble over. \"Out with it Allison, I haven't got all day to wait for you to collect your thoughts,\" and as if her words weren't sharp enough, she adds \"if you have any, that is.\" Allison's voice catches in her throat, and she changes course, no longer caring to present her bad news with any tact. \"The deal with Maybelline has fallen through, they've decided to go with another firm.\" There it is, the terrible truth, and even though she knew what Allison was going to say, the sting is just as great. The fire that was already brewing within her grows ever more. She is having an awful morning, and now the biggest deal of the year has eluded her grasp; so much for Saturday. Reeling from anger and disappointment, she doesn't pay any mind to Allisons frantic mumbling, as she clutches the phone with an iron grip. She takes a deep breath, and interrupts the panicking assistant. \"Allison, stop talking,\" She says rather coldly, \"I will be in the office in 20 minutes, gather the partners, and for godsakes, have a pot of coffee ready.\" She hangs up before Allison has a chance to say anything further. For a moment all is quiet, as she collects her thoughts. She is used to being on call seven days a week; there is always a fire that needs to be put out, but she needed today. The idea of facing the world this morning feels terribly heavy.\n\nAs she surveys the sleek, minimalist design of her penthouse apartment, a surge of revulsion washes over her. The sterile aesthetic, once a symbol of sophistication, now feels suffocating. With each pristine surface and carefully curated piece of furniture, her anger simmers beneath the surface, threatening to boil over. Before she even knows what she\"s done, the coffee cup smashes into a framed picture on the far wall, sending both crashing to the ground in a spray of broken glass and ceramic shards. She lets out a guttural scream, containing the fullness of her anger, and perhaps a bit of sadness. As it leaves her body, and reason seeps back into her mind, she sees what she has done and is overcome with another familiar feeling; grief. \"No, no, no…\" she desperately whispers to herself as she rushes to the wreckage on the far side of the room, and begins digging through the pile of glass with reckless abandon, cutting her hands in the process, but paying it no mind. How could she be so foolish, so stupid? In the shattered remains of the framed photograph, fragments of memories surface – a smile captured in a moment of joy, a shared laugh frozen in time. At last, her bleeding hands come upon a now crumpled photograph, and she does her best to smooth it out on the edge of her coffee table. \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,\" she sobs to only herself, as nobody else is there to hear it. The white border of the photograph has taken on a pink hue from her bleeding hands, and the table edge catches a small rip in the paper, and the photograph tears in two. A look of horror spreads across her face, and she collapses to the ground in a pool of tears. As she cradles the torn photograph in her trembling hands, she is overcome by a wave of regret and sorrow. The image, once a cherished memory, now lies in tatters. In the silence of the empty apartment, her whispered apologies are met with only the echo of her own despair.\n\nWhen she collects herself, she gets a hand broom and a dustpan from the kitchen closet and sweeps up the glass without a word. She dumps the shards and the remains of the photograph haphazardly into the trash can beneath the sink, nearly spilling the mess right back onto the tile. She is not thinking now, but going through the motions; there isn't time to feel sorry for herself, for there is business to be done, and sinking ships to salvage. She rinses her hand in the bathroom sink and winces at the sting of the cold water hitting her wounds; it's okay, she thinks, I had it coming. When the cuts are thoroughly cleaned and free of glass, she tightly wraps them with bandages from the medicine cabinet, and dons a pair of Versace leather gloves. No sense in having to answer any unwanted questions at the office. Once she has put herself back together, she takes a deep breath, and steps out of her apartment and into the elevator. She rides down 74 floors without a word, greeting nobody that enters the small space. When she lands in the lobby, she ignores the doorman's pleasant goodbyes and steps into the cool spring air of West 61st Street. Her office is only a few blocks from her penthouse, so she feels no need to have the valet bring her car around, and resigns herself to the walk; the car will continue to gather dust in the garage. When she arrives at the agency, there will no doubt be a boardroom of sweaty yesmen waiting for her to save the day, so she will use this time to come up with a strategy. Advertising can be a cutthroat world, and she didn't become one of the best by accepting no as an answer. The Maybeline deal will be no different; somehow, she will bring them back around, even if she has to sacrifice. She is no stranger to sacrifice.\n\nOn the bustling streets of New York, one can expect to see any number of interesting characters: homeless men begging for change, a man with a box of CDs extorting people for five dollar bills, end-of-the-world prophets, and sometimes, very public arguments that are best left to the bedroom. On her daily walk to work, she has become an expert in tuning out the wider world entirely, keeping a stony expression and walking with purpose. After the morning she has had, she sinks right back into this familiar demeanor, paying no mind to the controlled chaos of city life. She walks past newspaper stands, and cardboard cutouts of superheroes, and doesn't break her steady stride when the newsboys try to catch her attention. She had set aside this particular Saturday months ago and wants to finish this business with haste so she may return to solitude in her lonely high-rise apartment. She is one block away from her office when she is stopped by traffic at the crosswalk, waiting alongside a crowd of various people for the light to turn green so she can simply get on with it. As she waits, a man approaches to her right, shepherding a little girl with golden blonde hair who could be no older than six. Atop her head is a plastic tiara that reads in big, obnoxious cursive letters \"Birthday Princess.\" The father is carrying a set of mylar balloons that could be any number of Disney princesses, but she is unsure; she hasn't kept track of princesses for some time. The father grabs his daughter's hand and pulls her closer, \"Keep near me Ava, we don't want any cars to get you on your birthday.\" Ava furrows her brow in a look that could say \"who would dare run over a princess,\" but she relents and hugs her dad's leg. \"Is this close enough daddy,\" she says with a mischievous smile, \"nobody can get me now!\" The stoplight feels as though it is lasting an eternity, and the woman begins tapping her foot restlessly. The father is looking at his daughter with an exaggerated look of exasperation that could say \"I can't take you anywhere!\" and Ava bursts into a fit of giggles. The light turns green and the father scoops up Ava in his arms and says \"Alright princess Ava, let's get you to your birthday party,\" and Ava cheers as they begin to step across the crosswalk. As she observes the interaction between the father and daughter, a voice whispers in the depths of her mind, questioning the choices that have led her to this moment. Doubt creeps in, like tendrils of smoke curling around her thoughts. She pushes these fleeting thoughts aside, but they linger at the edges of her consciousness, stirring something within her. The scene before her stirs a quiet yearning, a whisper of something lost. Memories, long buried, surface like ripples on a calm pond, hinting at what once was. She feels a pang in her chest, a fleeting sense of emptiness, as if something precious has slipped through her fingers. Yet, she brushes these feelings aside with practiced ease, burying them beneath layers of false resolve. The woman lets out a heavy sigh of relief and takes a step forward when something inside her stomach turns sour, and immense pressure falls upon her shoulders. All at once, her feet give out from under her, and she collapses to the sidewalk.\n\nShe lies flat on her back on the pavement, her arms and legs spread out in the vague shape of a snow angel, as a crowd of people gathers around her. They barrage her with a slew of concerns and questions: \"What happened? Are you okay? Do you need help?\" Outstretched hands appear all around her, and she opens her mouth to say she is fine and to leave her be when horror washes over her like a tidal wave. In a frantic and terrified voice, she screams, \"I can't move my arms! I can't move my fucking arms!\" Panic begins to consume her from the inside as she realizes she cannot move her legs either. She attempts to wiggle her fingers and toes, expecting them to remain frozen, but they do, in fact, wiggle to and fro. She comes to the conclusion that she isn't paralyzed, but she is unable to get up. It feels as though something or someone is holding her down, pinning her to the pavement. The crowd moves in closer as a million thoughts flow in and out of her whirling mind. She can move her head from side to side, but she cannot raise it. \"Help me please, somebody help me up, I can't move!\" she blurts out through desperate sobs, hoping either a good Samaritan or God will save her from this hellish moment. A large man with a bald head parts the murmuring crowd and approaches her, kneeling behind her head. \"Don't worry, ma'am, I'm going to get you to a hospital,\" he says with a confidence that implies he was ready for this exact circumstance. He begins to slide his hands under her shoulders and pauses; a puzzled look appears on his haggard face. He moves to her legs and attempts the same maneuver and again finds no purchase. He steps back, visibly deflated, and rubs his smooth head. \"I can't… I can't get my hands under you,\" he stammers, a little unsure of what he's saying. \"It's like you're glued to the ground or something.\" She shoots him a look of bewildered disbelief and practically screeches, \"What the fuck are you talking about?! Help me up, please!\" Another man pushes through the crowd, eager to do what the previous man could not, and says, \"Alright, let's get her up.\" Both men take place on either side of the woman and prepare to lift her as though they were about to move a dresser. They clutch the fabric of her jacket and pants and pull with all their might, when the fabric tears and both men tumble backward.\n\nThe crowd, now quite sizable, has begun to murmur amongst themselves, in awe of the curious spectacle. The woman has begun weeping openly, pleading for help in broken English interrupted by shuddered breath. One by one, people emerge from the crowd and attempt to lift her, and one by one, they all fail to move her even a single inch. Tears stream down her cheeks as she begs for help, her voice choked with fear and desperation. Each failed attempt to lift her only deepens her sense of helplessness, like a weight pressing down on her chest, suffocating her with dread. Arguments form in small groups about what the best course of action is, and somebody has the bright idea to call the police. After some time, the crowd disperses a bit as police officers and EMTs break through the spectacle and set up a perimeter. They too, attempt to pick up the woman, a stretcher waiting patiently nearby for her arrival, but it will remain empty. The emergency workers are no more able to lift her than the good Samaritans who tried before. All the while, the woman pleads and cries for help, a million horrible thoughts bombarding her brain. She watches as the police officers form a circle and discuss what exactly is happening here. One of the officers scratches his head, puzzled. \"I\"ve never seen anything like this,\" he mutters to his colleague. \"You think it\"s some kind of industrial adhesive?\" They resolve to cut off her clothes to free her. Out come the knives and scissors, and they surround her once more. As the paramedics cut away her clothes, she shivers in the cold air, feeling exposed and vulnerable. The once-pristine fabric of her designer jacket and luxury pants lay in tatters around her, a stark contrast to her pale skin. Lying cold and mostly nude, as a crowd looks upon her pale body, she weeps in embarrassment as the EMTs once again gather around her to lift her up, and once again, fail. They quickly discover that they are not able to pull her now ruined clothes out from under her. There is a ruckus in the audience, as news vans and reporters arrive at the scene, eager to get the scoop on this bizarre story unfolding before them. The police officers remove them from the scene rather forcibly and set up sawhorses around the perimeter, but the reporters continue to crowd around the barrier, screaming out inappropriate questions and queries. \"Ma'am, ma'am, are these police officers treating you okay?\" yells a reporter with a bad toupee, \"Ma'am, is this some kind of political statement?\" yells another with makeup so thick, you could slice it like cake. Amidst the chaos, she feels herself slipping further into shock, her thoughts a jumbled mess of disbelief and confusion. Is this really happening to her? Is it some kind of nightmare she can\"t wake up from? After a while, the police radio in for the firefighters.\n\nAs the blaring sirens of the fire trucks cut through the noise of the scene, a palpable sense of urgency grips the air. Onlookers exchange anxious glances, their murmurs growing louder with each passing moment, as the arrival of the firefighters promises a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. They enter the space with a rather large and frightening electric saw. The woman lies there speechless as they saw through the concrete, showering her in a spray of sparks that lightly singe her flesh. They cut a perfect square around her body and approach with crowbars, anchoring them beneath the isolated concrete. Ten firemen attempt to pry the piece of sidewalk up with all their might, but it doesn't move an inch. Hours go by and day creeps into night, as the rescue workers try everything they can think of: forklifts, jackhammers, even a bucket loader. Nothing works, and the woman remains pinned to the earth. She stares out of glassy eyes as the simple plans of mice and men fail again and again to free her. With each futile attempt to dislodge her from her concrete prison, the woman\"s despair deepens, mirrored in the weary faces of the firefighters. Exhausted and demoralized, they exchange worried glances that speak of their growing doubt. Her phone begins ringing constantly after a while, the sounds of Adele punctuating her nightmare, but nobody ever answers it. In the grand scheme of things, a cell phone seems like small potatoes. Amidst the backdrop of flashing lights, bystanders stand transfixed, their expressions ranging from shock to curiosity. Some exchange hushed whispers, speculating on the possibilities at play, and some whisper prayers under their breath, while others simply watch in morbid fascination. The woman feels every eye upon her. As the night bleeds into the morning, the crowd begins to thin as the police and EMTs simply give up. For some unknown reason, this woman cannot be moved, as though God were holding her down with his finger. A kind officer covers her with a blanket and feeds her by hand as she stares up at the tops of skyscrapers and the vacant blue sky. Something inside her has broken, and she no longer weeps. If there were a word she could say to release her from her prison on the sidewalk, it doesn't come.\n\nDays go by slowly at first, and then quickly become weeks. Each passing day brings with it a growing numbness, a resignation to her fate that settles like a heavy blanket over her weary soul. At first, it seems as though the media storm will never let the spectacle end, as endless news teams and reporters descend upon the woman in the early days of her confinement. They batter her with questions and theories that range from the incredibly obvious to the downright absurd, but she pays them no mind, nor does she speak a word. The police keep the area cordoned off and stay with her for the first month, feeding her regularly and changing out her blankets. They do their best to keep her comfortable, but comfort feels like such an impossible thing to grant. All the while, she does nothing and says nothing. It seems as though her natural processes have shut down; even her breath becomes weak and shallow, and yet she lives. The reporters fall away, the crowds thin ever more, and her police guards go home, returning ever so often to feed her and provide her with sources of warmth on the colder days. After the first six months, she is largely left alone. Occasional outbursts of protest erupt among activists, their voices rising in defiance against the city\"s neglect of the woman trapped in their midst. To quell them, the city votes on a measure to build an enclosure for the woman, and it narrowly passes on a vote of 26 - 25. This enclosure turns out to be little more than a canopy and a space heater. The larger world moves on, and people commute to work, stepping around the immovable woman as though she were rubbish on the sidewalk. Advertisement campaigns begin in the city at some point, attempting to draw tourism. Billboards pop up that declare in big bold letters, \"Come see the immovable woman! The greatest mystery of mankind!\" It is a big success at first, but after a few years, even the tourists stop visiting. Throughout this time, scientists from across the globe convene in symposiums and conferences, debating the intricacies of her condition and proposing wild theories to explain her inexplicable plight. They arrive in droves, bringing various indescribable instruments and attempting to discover the cause of the woman\"s imprisonment. After endless theses and countless studies, the best they can do is give it a name: Sudden Intense Gravity Syndrome, or SIGS for short. It becomes the subject of infinite conspiracy theories for many years to come. When five years go by, even the curiosity of intellectuals runs out, as all of mankind eventually grows bored with its playthings.\n\nThe woman lies silently for many days and nights. Seasons pass like clockwork, and the city continues to change and evolve while she remains still. During the harsh winter months, the city offers her additional provisions to endure the biting cold, but as time passes, interest in helping her wanes completely. She becomes akin to the numerous statues and art installations that adorn New York City; a permanent fixture, unmoving and unchanging, seamlessly melding into the broader urban landscape. The buildings don't feel her endless cold stare, and the streets don't hear her soft cries in the night, but they stand in frozen solitude alongside her. In her immobility, she retreats deeper into the recesses of her mind, seeking respite in the vast expanse of her thoughts. She spends the first few years grappling with existential questions; pondering what, why, and how her situation came to be. She gets no closer to answers than any of the scientists who studied her previously, and learns to stop asking those questions. As curious as her predicament is, even the novelty of thinking about it becomes mundane after years, so she takes to other activities to occupy her mind. She counts the windows on all the buildings she can see, and memorizes the specific birds that fly by and occasionally land on her. She observes countless cars and listens to the myriad stories of passersby, gaining an almost intimate familiarity with those whose daily routines intersect with her path most frequently. Sometimes, she ventures into her memories, often triggering moments of sadness, the soft sound of her weeping drifting down the street as tears dampen the pavement beneath her. She does not mourn for the life that has been taken away from her, for she is convinced she never deserved it.\nAfter ten years, she is completely resigned to her fate and awaits death. She wonders if anyone would even notice if she were gone. Would they simply step over her body, oblivious to her presence? And if they did notice, would they be able to remove her, or would she remain here, a permanent fixture in the city\"s landscape? Will she have a funeral, and be buried with her loved ones, or will they simply melt her away until there's nothing left? She decides that it doesn't really matter, and welcomes the day with open arms. Even if she were suddenly freed, what kind of life awaited her? Her company had likely collapsed without her leadership, her penthouse seized by creditors. She has no one waiting for her, no home to return to. What kind of existence could she carve out for herself after this? What would her quality of life be like? Her body has been overtaken by moss and fungus, her hair a matted mess that no brush could penetrate. Her skin has hardened and taken the texture of a pumice stone. Her teeth feel like jagged rocks in her mouth, beyond saving after years of neglecting them. She imagines the absurdity of a dentist attempting a root canal on a prone patient lying on the sidewalk, the thought eliciting a weary smile on her cracked lips. What a show that would be! After all, there have been greater miracles. There have also been greater nightmares. To her best knowledge, she has never been sick, and nobody has run her over. While the city fed her pretty regularly in the beginning, they stopped doing that a few years ago, and yet she never hungers or thirsts. The horrifying thought begins to gnaw at her: What if she was immortal? The idea fills her with a desperate panic. 'Can I die?\" she wonders anxiously. \"Please, God, let me die.\" The prospect of endless existence weighed heavy on her soul, a burden she couldn\"t bear. She thinks, 'There are people waiting for me, I can't be here forever!' Memories of past pain and trauma flood her mind, mingling with her current despair. She pushes them away, unwilling to confront the demons that lurk in her past. There are things she cannot bear to think about, wounds too deep to reopen. There are worse things in life than the view from the sidewalk.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story, maintaining consistency with the original plot, character development, and tone:\n\nAs the years stretch into decades, the woman becomes a legend, a myth whispered among the city's inhabitants. Children grow up hearing stories about the mysterious lady trapped in the sidewalk, their parents using her tale as a cautionary fable about the dangers of ambition and the price of success. Some claim she's a witch, cursed for her sins. Others insist she's an alien, unable to return to her home planet. The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between, buried beneath layers of concrete and forgotten memories.\n\nOn particularly quiet nights, when the city's usual cacophony subsides, she allows herself to remember. The memories come in fragments, like shards of the broken photograph she destroyed so long ago. She sees flashes of a little girl with golden hair, much like the one she saw on her fateful last day of freedom. But this girl isn't a stranger's child – she's her own. The realization hits her with the force of a freight train, and she gasps, the sound barely audible above the gentle hum of the city.\n\nShe remembers now, with painful clarity, the choices she made. The late nights at the office, the missed birthdays, the broken promises. She recalls the look of disappointment in her daughter's eyes, mirrored in her husband's face. The arguments, the silences, the final, devastating goodbye. She had buried these memories so deep, convinced herself that success was worth any sacrifice. Now, pinned to the earth by an inexplicable force, she understands the true weight of her actions.\n\nAs this epiphany washes over her, something shifts. It's subtle at first, barely noticeable. But gradually, she becomes aware of a change. The pressure holding her down begins to lessen, ever so slightly. It's as if the earth itself is slowly releasing its grip on her.\n\nDays pass, and the sensation grows stronger. She finds she can wiggle her fingers more freely, can turn her head with greater ease. Hope, long dormant, begins to stir within her. But with hope comes fear – fear of what awaits her if she does regain her freedom.\n\nWeeks turn into months, and she feels the pressure continuing to abate. She begins to contemplate what she'll do if she can move again. Will she try to reclaim her old life? Or will she seize this second chance to make amends, to right the wrongs of her past?\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, as the city begins to stir, she feels a final release. The invisible force holding her down vanishes completely, leaving her free to move for the first time in decades. She lies there for a moment, overwhelmed by the sensation, afraid to believe it's real.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, she pushes herself up into a sitting position. Her muscles, atrophied from years of disuse, scream in protest. But she perseveres, driven by a determination she thought she had lost long ago.\n\nAs she struggles to her feet, leaning against a nearby building for support, she notices a young woman watching her. The woman's eyes are wide with disbelief, her mouth hanging open in shock. But there's something familiar about her features, something that tugs at the edges of the newly-freed woman's memory.\n\n\"Mom?\" the young woman whispers, her voice trembling.\n\nAnd suddenly, she knows. This is her daughter, now grown, with streaks of gray in her golden hair and lines of worry etched around her eyes. But it's her, unmistakably her.\n\nTears well up in both their eyes as they stand there, separated by years of absence and a chasm of unspoken words. The freed woman takes a tentative step forward, her legs shaking with the effort.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she says, her voice hoarse from disuse. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nHer daughter rushes forward, catching her as she stumbles. They cling to each other, both sobbing now, as the city bustles around them, oblivious to the miracle unfolding on its streets.\n\nAs they embrace, the woman realizes that her imprisonment wasn't just a punishment – it was a chance for redemption. A opportunity to learn what truly matters in life. And now, as she holds her daughter close, she vows to make the most of this second chance.\n\nThe road ahead won't be easy. There will be explanations to give, relationships to rebuild, and a whole new world to navigate. But for the first time in decades, she feels truly free. Not just from the physical bonds that held her, but from the chains of ambition and self-importance that had trapped her long before she ever became stuck to that sidewalk.\n\nAs mother and daughter walk slowly away from the spot that had been her prison for so long, she glances back one last time. The indent of her body remains in the concrete, a testament to her ordeal. But she knows that the real marks of her experience are invisible – etched on her heart and soul, reminding her of the lessons she's learned and the person she wants to become.\n\nWith each shaky step, she moves forward into an uncertain future. But this time, she's not alone. And this time, she knows what truly matters. The city continues its relentless pace around them, but for these two women, reunited against all odds, time stands still.

{"id": "text_completion_009", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The beach was a symbol of relaxation. It was where children played in the waves while the parents relaxed in the sun. Well, the parents let themselves bake in the sun until they realized they lost their kids. Then, they panicked and searched across the sands annoying everyone. Eventually, a helpful volleyball player showed up with the kids. You thank them until. Wait, why is your spouse staring so long at that volleyball player? Sure, they look like you did younger. Well, more like a young fit version of you. Okay, they looked nothing like you did, and why was your spouse standing so close. This was a disaster. We should\"ve never came here on family vacation.\n\n\nTo most people who haven\"t had such a dramatic experience, the beach was a nice place. It represented a freedom from modern stresses and a chance to enjoy the sun. Sandcastles lined the sands like an army defending its territory. Shells were collected as if they held monetary value. Such a shame this culture was destroyed by the Mierans.\n\nHumans had always liked to take breaks, but the location was limited by time and resources. When the world was destroyed, the breaks turned into a night where two people guarded the door rather than three. The prime real estate became the pond a few blocks away to keep an eye on the supplies. Tourist traps became rusted as there was a lack of tourists to trap. Except for the dumbest people.\n\n\"Hurry up, we are going to be late,\" Polly yelled. Jim fell down the stairs. He had a beach towel on one arm and a tuxedo on his other.\n\n\"What is that for?\" Polly grabbed the pants.\n\n\"You said bring a swimsuit,\" Jim said. Polly shook her head.\n\n\"Why I am surrounded by idiots.\" She turned back to the stairs. \"Check-in ends at four pm.\"\n\n\"Isn\"t it your friend who\"s in charge?\" Olivia walked down the stairs carrying a handbag full of vacation essentials. Her dress was loose and flowing.\n\n\"He told me that he wouldn\"t make exceptions,\" Polly said.\n\n\"That makes sense. If you were my friend, I wouldn\"t make exceptions for you too,\" Olivia replied. Polly ignored her which angered Olivia.\n\n\"Reid! Frida! Get down here,\" Polly yelled. Frida ran down the stairs. She was most excited about the possibility of hunting. As such, she had a crossbow, a harpoon, and a flare. Her prey wasn\"t sharks; it was crabs. Reid followed her down in a swimsuit. With every step, he practiced flexing and posing. His body was adequate. His biceps were present, but they didn\"t bulge. If he held his breath, his torso acquired some definition. In total, he was making a fool of himself.\n\n\"I\"m ready to mingle.\" He shimmied at the bottom step. Polly and Olivia reacted with horror while Jim nodded his head.\n\n\"We\"re going to be so popular.\" Jim put his arm around Reid who shook him off.\n\n\"Just me. You can be my wingman,\" Reid said.\n\n\"Sure thing,\" Jim replied.\n\n\"Whatever, let\"s get going,\" Polly said. The five of them made their way out of their small house. The road to the vacation was long, and it took a few days travel by foot. They didn\"t plan on travel time. Fortunately, Frida was skilled at capturing beasts (some of which were mutants) and tried all plants to ensure it wasn\"t poisonous (Jim tried them as well because Frida was likely immune to all poisons). After their journey, they reached Pacifico City.\n\nIt was one of the few cities established after the war. The military ran the country, and Pacfico City wanted to cater to their needs. Multiple resorts sat close to the beach. By the resorts, there shooting ranges and ATVs for pleasure. There was an assortment of bars and restaurants as well. Each had its own signature dish or cocktail. There was one issue. The customers never came.\n\nThe upper brass couldn\"t leave. The new military was disorganized, and vacations were an opportunity to be removed by force. The soldiers were forced to stay by their commanders. If they were going to be miserable, everyone else was going to be miserable as well. The result was a sad city filled with abandoned resorts. The weapons and ATVs were stolen by raiders who put it to better use. The bars and restaurants had their supplies looted, and the workers moved on.\n\nThe vacation house in question was a dingy hotel far from the beach. When the five arrived, a man sat behind the desk with his mouth open. A fly flew in and out of it. There was a wall with keys behind him. The man didn\"t react when they entered. He did perk up when Polly hit the bell on his desk.\n\n\"Welcome to Tropical Fun. You missed check-in time,\" he said.\n\n\"Rick, it\"s me. Can\"t you make an exception,\" Polly replied.\n\n\"Check-in ends at four. It\"s half past five.\" Rick pointed at the clock. Olivia looked down.\n\n\"That clock isn\"t moving,\" she said. Rick looked down.\n\n\"Oh, I\"ve only been working here for a few months. I inherited it from my uncle. He died in a mutant iguana attack,\" Rick said.\n\n\"Sorry for your loss,\" Polly said.\n\n\"Don\"t be. I hated him.\" Rick turned around. He gave them two keys. Before arriving, it was agreed that Olivia would get a room by herself. Reid and Polly were okay with this because Jim and Frida slept on the floor. The floor was preferrable when they saw their rooms. Reid\"s bed was simultaneously too hard and too soft, Polly\"s was always wet, and Olivia\"s had mutant bed bugs. The rooms smelled like burnt cabbage. The bathrooms were filled with flies and rodents.\n\n\"Well this is a disaster.\" Reid looked out the window. \"There\"s no one here to enjoy my show.\"\n\n\"Their loss.\" Olivia was hiding in the other room because she was scared of bugs. She wouldn\"t let them know.\n\n\"No, every cloud has a silver lining.\" Reid turned with a smile on this face. \"We are going to restore this city to its former glory.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story:\n\nReid's enthusiasm was met with skeptical looks from the others. Polly rolled her eyes, \"And how exactly do you propose we do that?\"\n\n\"Simple,\" Reid grinned, flexing his mediocre muscles. \"We'll become the attractions ourselves! I'll start a beachside workout class. Jim can be my assistant.\"\n\nJim nodded eagerly, still wearing his mismatched tuxedo and beach towel ensemble.\n\nFrida perked up, \"I could offer hunting expeditions! There must be some interesting mutant creatures around here.\"\n\n\"No one's going to pay for that,\" Olivia muttered from behind the door of her bug-infested room.\n\nPolly sighed, \"Look, we're here for a relaxing vacation. Let's just try to make the best of it.\"\n\nAs they made their way to the beach, they found it eerily empty. The sand was littered with debris, and the water had an odd, greenish tint. Reid, undeterred, began setting up for his \"beach body bootcamp.\"\n\nFrida wandered off, crossbow in hand, muttering about tracking down some \"beach crabs.\" Jim followed Reid, awkwardly attempting to mimic his poses.\n\nPolly and Olivia settled on a relatively clean patch of sand. \"This isn't quite what I imagined,\" Olivia said, swatting away a fly.\n\n\"At least it's quiet,\" Polly replied, trying to find a silver lining.\n\nTheir peace was short-lived. A commotion erupted as Frida came running back, pursued by what appeared to be a giant, mutated hermit crab. Its shell was the size of a small car, and its pincers snapped menacingly.\n\n\"I found dinner!\" Frida yelled excitedly, as the monster crab knocked over Reid's makeshift workout station.\n\nChaos ensued as the group scrambled to avoid the creature's massive claws. Jim, in a moment of unexpected bravery (or perhaps just confusion), threw his beach towel over the crab's eyes. The creature, momentarily disoriented, stumbled into the sea.\n\nAs they caught their breath, a small crowd began to gather. It seemed the commotion had drawn out some of the city's few remaining inhabitants.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" one onlooker exclaimed. \"Do you do this show every day?\"\n\nReid, ever the opportunist, jumped in. \"Of course we do! Welcome to Pacifico City's premier beach adventure experience!\"\n\nWord spread quickly. Over the next few days, more people started showing up to the beach. Reid's workout class gained a following, with Jim as his enthusiastic (if uncoordinated) sidekick. Frida's \"extreme beach safaris\" became a hit, though Polly insisted on implementing some safety measures.\n\nOlivia, surprising everyone including herself, started a beachside meditation class to \"find inner peace amidst the chaos of the post-apocalyptic world.\"\n\nEven Rick from the hotel got involved, offering \"authentic post-war accommodations\" to visitors seeking a unique experience.\n\nAs their vacation came to an end, the group looked out at the now-bustling beach. \"I can't believe we actually did it,\" Polly said, a hint of pride in her voice.\n\n\"See? I told you we'd restore this place to its former glory,\" Reid grinned.\n\n\"Well, maybe not quite its former glory,\" Olivia chuckled, watching a mutant seagull swoop down to steal someone's sandwich.\n\nAs they packed up to leave, they realized that their disastrous vacation had turned into something unexpectedly wonderful. They had brought a little life back to Pacifico City, and in doing so, had found the relaxation and adventure they were looking for all along.\n\n\"Same time next year?\" Jim asked hopefully.\n\nThe others exchanged glances and smiled. Despite the challenges, or perhaps because of them, they had found a new annual tradition in the most unlikely of places.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the original story, preserving the established plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_010", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Deep within the bowels of the University of Greyvein, in a far-removed corner of the library, sat two novice scholars with their noses deep in dusty tomes. Ferin, a frigid young man in his early twentieth year, sat hunched over, scanning the pages of an old book detailing predators in Naiadara. Beside him, Rodrick scribbled furiously on a wrinkled yellow notebook, copying the words from another book without bothering to understand them. His beaky nose and strange haircut made him stand out among the other scholars, but not in a good way. Ferin only tolerated his presence because he was the only other Water Wielder among the novice scholars.\n\n\nFerin glanced at Rodrick with a scowl, crossing his arms and leaning away from him, barely hiding his frustration. He slammed another book shut, adding it to the pile of useless texts on the table. He crumpled the parchment in his hand, feeling the ink smudge on his fingers. He had spent hours poring over the books, but none of them had the answers he sought.\n\n*Nothing I can use at least,* Ferin thought. *I need something that will impress them.* He wasn't sure who he was referring to.\n\nA sudden movement in his peripheral vision causes Ferin to look to his right and see a man in swishy dark robes walk past the mouth of the aisle with speed. Turning back to his book, he rereads a line about the hunting habits of apex predators.\n\n\"Good afternoon gentlemen. You're the two novice Water Invokers, right\"\n\nBoth men were surprised by the gravelly voice, turning slowly to face the source, who stood leaning on Ferin's chair with one arm. \"Yes…\" Rodrick answers timidly. \"And you are?\" Ferin kicked his foot under the desk, gesturing with a sharp eye motion to the gold insignia etched into his loose black sleeves.\n\n*I can't say I've ever seen a High Scholar wear those colours before*, Ferin thought. The man looked young at first glance, but the deep facial creases and streaks of grey betrayed his true age.\n\nRodrick dropped his head. \"My apologies Venerable Scholar. What do you need of us?\"\n\n\"I am High Scholar Amren. Eminence Barik, your superior, informs me you are Invokers? If so, I have a little invitation I think you'll be interested in. Are either of you familiar with the Arbiter?\"\n\n\"As in the Traverser?\" Ferin asked. Nervously, he fidgeted with the small sky-blue gem dangling on a chain earring. \"I read about it, but I didn't think it was real.\"\n\n\"You'd be partially justified for believing that based on what some of those dusty tomes might say. It has been dormant for a long time, but it has recently been detected in the jungle of Northern Ashijan. If you can tolerate the three days it'll take to walk there, there will be great reward in locating it.\" The man spoke a bit above a whisper. \"Wealth and influence as scholars for sure, and if you manage to make a deal with it, you would have access to the most powerful Traverser in all Naiadara.\"\n\n\"Why us?\" Ferin asked, narrowing his eyes. \"Wouldn't the other High Scholars want to keep this under wraps?\" He didn't trust the High Scholar's smile. There had to be a catch.\n\nThis time it was Rodrick\"s turn to kick. \"Don't be rude, Ferin. The business of the High Scholars is their own.\" He grinned at the High Scholar, not caring about the consequences. \"What he means to say is that we are interested and that he knows not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Right, Ferin?\"\n\nFerin's eyes flickered to the window, where he imagined his parents finally welcoming him home. He swallowed hard and nodded. Facing the man again, he forced out a reply, his voice cracking slightly. \"Yes, we are interested. How hard do you think it will be?\"\n\n*It seems almost too good to be true*, he thought. *But even on the off chance it is… I could get them out of that hovel, and secure a good life for them.*\n\nIt was vain, and he knew it, but his interest had been piqued and found he had already made his decision. Turning back to the man, he said, with a hint of doubt in his voice, \"Yes, we are interested. How hard do you think it will be?\"\n\nHigh Scholar Amren withdrew a small folded page of parchment containing a detailed image of a small section of the jungle where the Arbiter can be found. With a hopeful smile and a scratchy voice, he said, \"I don't think there will be much struggle.\"\n\nWithout another word, he walked back up the aisle and around the corner. Ferin looked at Rodrick, both of them quickly processing what just occurred before promptly gathering their belongings from the desk and hurrying up the aisle and out of the library toward the dormitory. After pausing at Ferin's door, they decide to pack their belongings today for an early departure, and Rodrick hurries off to his room.\n\nA few moments after Ferin began to pack, his door bangs open to admit Rodrick, who closes the door and pauses to catch his breath before asking an inane question about shoes. Ferin began to ask him to leave when the door banged open for a second time, this time to reveal their instructor, Eminence Barik. A plump man with entirely too much weight on his hips and a shiny bald head currently the same pink as his exasperated face.\n\n\"What is all this running about?\" He demanded. \"I saw you both burst in here like tubby children in a candy store! What's gotten you so riled up?\"\n\nHe paused briefly, looking at the paper on the desk and then at Ferin, who was motionless with a bag in one hand, a pair of pants in the other, and a small heap of clothes and other items on his bed. Then he looked at Rodrick, who was holding a different pair of shoes in either hand and back at Ferin.\n\n\"Why does it look like you are going somewhere?\"\n\nRodrick spoke before Ferin could. \"We were given a task by a High Scholar to seek a Traverser in Ashijan.\" His face was a few shades paler than usual and he stood at attention, clasping his hands behind his back with enough force to send a shoe flying from his grip.\n\nBarik paid it no mind.\n\n\"A High Scholar? Ashijan?\" Barik repeated incredulously. His eyes suddenly sharpened like a hawk\"s, and he darted to the paper on the desk, barely beating Ferin to it. He scanned it for a moment before Ferin yanked it out of his grasp, but it was too late. \"The Arbiter? But that's…no…hold on. Wait right here. You do not have permission to leave until I have it in writing or else I will have you expelled!\"\n\nHe dashed out of the room and down the hall, likely to the High Scholar's audience chamber. Ferin's heart thundered in his ears as he assessed his options as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter coming to an uneasy decision, he said, \"Rodrick, if you're coming, pack everything you need in the next five minutes and meet me by the southernmost gate. We leave now, not tomorrow.\"\n\n\"But-\" He began.\n\n\"Do as you will. I will wait two minutes and then I will leave. With or without you.\" Ferin said sharply, not even looking at the other man as he continued shoving bits of clothing into his bag.\n\nRodrick said nothing else as he sprinted out of the room. Ferin forced himself to be as meticulous as possible while packing to distract himself from the tingling anxiety building in his chest. Not that he's nervous about going, but because he is unsure if he just made a mistake allowing Rodrick to come alongside him.\n\n*If it comes down to him or me, he won't get in my way.*\n\nFerin was finished with his bag, and just before leaving, he paused, pulling open the bottom drawer of his desk and withdrawing a small rectangular wooden box from underneath a stack of books. Within, submerged in water from this morning\"s high tide, was an earring with a grape-size arctic blue gem attached to a short silver chain. The gem on both earrings is known as an Ego and is crucial for all elemental magical Wielding, including Ferin's Invoking.\n\nFerin felt far more confident sensing the larger gem swing, knowing it was money well spent despite spending literally everything he owned to buy it. Ferin\"s gaze flickered to the faded portrait of his family on his desk; the only copy they had between them. The potential of providing for them and proving his worth as an Invoker and Scholar fuelled a newfound determination. The sudden well of power tugging at his ear was momentarily disconcerting but he pushed it out of his mind before rushing out of the room.\n\nAfter a speedy walk, he arrives at the southern exit from the University grounds. It was a tall wrought iron gate, part of a taller perimeter wall, that Ferin chose due to its immediate proximity to a small pond.\n\nBehind trees, he quickly dropped his belongings, using a smooth stone to hastily write a note to his family telling them he would be away for a few days but that he felt this was finally his moment. Tying the note with twine, he creeps to the nearby water.\n\nAs he submerged his right hand, Eo, the pent-up magical energy within the Ego, rushed into him. The gem at his ear glowed brightly from within. A surge of power coursed through his body like a riptide, radiating off his skin and warping like hot air above a campfire. The pond responded, its surface rippling with an iridescent sheen.\n\nClosing his eyes, he senses Naiadara, the wellspring dimension fuelling all Water Wielding and housing the creatures Invokers summon. Seconds later, he feels a pushback on his magic, indicating his bait has been taken. The pond ceased to be just water; it became a gateway to a hidden world. It was no longer a mere surface but a doorway to Naiadara, the manifestation of his Invoking ability to pierce through the veil between realms.\n\nHe opened his eyes just in time to see a blurred shape shooting upward and landing behind Ferin with a wet thump.\n\nTurning, he examined the Traverser—a bulky amphibian creature, perched on strong hopping legs, with a flat shell, snapping beak, and toadlike dark blue-grey skin. The Croakshell stared blankly at him, awaiting a command, but Ferin ignored it for now.\n\nGetting up, Ferin harnessed the pond\"s lingering Eo, dismissing the portal and raising a water sphere above his head with a sweep of his hand. His focus intensified, and he immersed his senses into Naiadara once more. Delicately, he sought his target, detecting its erratic movements responding to the subtle allure of his Eo bait. The ball began to shrink into itself, its centre darkening before ballooning outward. With a satisfying pop, the bubble burst, revealing a small Traverser hovering above the trees.\n\n\"A Flitterfly!\"\n\nFerin nearly yelped, turning to see Rodrick looking excitedly upward at the creature, a slightly bulbous bag slung on his back and kept in place with a brown strap across his chest.\n\n\"Keep it down or I will leave you behind,\" Ferin hissed. \"I need it to deliver a note and we can leave. I want to get as much of a head start as possible before night falls.\"\n\nHe turned his attention back to the Flitterfly, giving it a mental command to land on his arm. With its speed and sense of direction, this Traverser was the Naiadara equivalent of a carrier pigeon, making it useful for delivering messages. It had shimmering sky-blue scales and pointed dorsal and caudal fin alongside two insectoid eyes with two sets of wide membranous wings that flapped faster than the eye could see.\n\nIt grabbed the rolled note with its two front legs before kicking off with its remaining four, whizzing through the sky toward his parents\" farm an hour north of the Greyvein city walls. Ferin hoped his parents would read his note, but he had a nagging feeling that he should've gone to see them himself.\n\n*I don't want to think about that right now. Just focus on the trip.*\n\nQuickly closing the distance, Rodrick stuck his face uncomfortably close. \"Is that a new Ego? I thought the gem was smaller before.\"\n\n\"It was.\" Ferin said, pulling it out of his ear while taking a cautious step back. \"This is a Grade Two that I paid through the nose to get.\" He traced his fingers over the gem, seeing its once-bright hue had darkened into a deep azure, perfectly mirroring the shade of Ferin's eyes.\n\n\"I wish I had one that nice. I'm stuck with the basic one the University loaned me.\" Rodrick moaned ignorantly.\n\n\"Work as hard as I do and you'll get there one day.\"\n\n\"You know everyone calls both of us 'The Piddles', right?\"\n\n\"Shut up, Piddles. Let's get moving.\"\n\nThe pair walked out of the University grounds and into the bustle of the city with the Traverser hopping alongside them. They had to push their way through, but the crowds helped immensely to conceal them and their batrachian companion, who had no issue weaving through the people to stay as close as possible. Ferin kept the parchment from the High Scholar on his person at all times because, without it, they would have no chance of locating The Arbiter or the riches at the end.\n\nThe gaggle of guards posted at the city gate gave them a quizzical look, first for their novice scholar robes, and then for the remarkably strange animal accompanying them, but allowed them both to pass without any hassle.\n\n*Probably because we're leaving instead of entering*, Ferin thought humorously. But he still did not dare lower his guard yet. Just because they had escaped the confines of the city hardly guaranteed their safe passage. *The University is certainly preparing to send a force after us, for if the information I carry is true…*\n\nFerin shuddered, suddenly feeling the implications of his actions. He clenched his teeth and hoped, with every fiber of his being, that he was not embarking on a fool's errand. However, Ferin was so absorbed in these thoughts that he failed to notice the mental link to his Flitterfly forcibly severed before reaching the city limits.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The sun began to dip below the horizon as Ferin and Rodrick trudged along the dusty road leading south. The Croakshell hopped alongside them, its webbed feet leaving peculiar imprints in the dirt. Ferin's mind raced with thoughts of what lay ahead, while Rodrick chattered incessantly about their sudden adventure.\n\n\"I can't believe we're actually doing this!\" Rodrick exclaimed for the umpteenth time. \"Do you think we'll be famous when we get back? Oh, I hope so!\"\n\nFerin gritted his teeth, his patience wearing thin. \"Rodrick, if you don't lower your voice, I swear I'll use the Croakshell to gag you.\"\n\nRodrick fell silent for a moment before whispering, \"Sorry, I'm just excited. Do you think we should camp soon? It's getting dark.\"\n\nFerin glanced at the fading light and nodded reluctantly. \"Fine. We'll find a spot off the road.\"\n\nAs they ventured into a small clearing in the woods, Ferin felt a nagging sensation at the back of his mind. Something was off, but he couldn't quite place it. He shook off the feeling and focused on setting up camp.\n\nWhile Rodrick fumbled with starting a fire, Ferin took stock of their supplies. His eyes widened as he realized they had forgotten to pack food in their haste to leave. He cursed under his breath, mentally berating himself for such a rookie mistake.\n\n\"Rodrick,\" he called out, \"did you bring any food?\"\n\nRodrick looked up from his pitiful attempt at a fire, his face sheepish. \"Uh... I thought you were handling that part.\"\n\nFerin pinched the bridge of his nose, exhaling slowly. \"Of course you did. Well, we'll have to forage or hunt. I'll see what I can do with the Croakshell.\"\n\nAs night fell, Ferin managed to catch a few small fish from a nearby stream using the Croakshell's quick reflexes. They ate in silence, the gravity of their situation finally settling in.\n\n\"Ferin,\" Rodrick said quietly, \"do you think we did the right thing? Leaving like that?\"\n\nFerin stared into the fire, conflicting emotions warring within him. \"We didn't have a choice. If we had waited, they would have stopped us. This is our chance to prove ourselves.\"\n\nRodrick nodded, though he didn't look entirely convinced. \"I hope you're right.\"\n\nAs they prepared to sleep, Ferin took first watch, his mind still troubled by the strange feeling from earlier. He absently touched his ear, reaching for the comforting presence of his Flitterfly through their mental link. His blood ran cold as he realized the connection was gone.\n\nPanic surged through him as he frantically searched his mind for any trace of the Traverser. Nothing. The link had been severed, and he hadn't even noticed. His message to his parents... had it even been delivered?\n\nFerin's breathing quickened as the implications hit him. Someone or something had interfered with his Flitterfly. Were they being followed? Was this all part of some elaborate trap?\n\nHe glanced at the sleeping form of Rodrick, debating whether to wake him. No, he decided. There was no point in alarming him just yet. Ferin would need to be more vigilant, more careful.\n\nAs the night wore on, Ferin's paranoia grew. Every rustle in the bushes, every hoot of an owl sent his heart racing. He found himself constantly checking the map given to them by High Scholar Amren, wondering if it too was part of some deception.\n\nWhen dawn finally broke, Ferin had not slept a wink. He roused Rodrick, who yawned and stretched, oblivious to Ferin's inner turmoil.\n\n\"Rise and shine, Piddles,\" Ferin said, trying to keep his voice steady. \"We've got a long day ahead of us.\"\n\nAs they packed up camp and set out, Ferin's mind raced with possibilities. Who could be behind this? The University? Rival scholars? Or something far more sinister?\n\nThe jungle of Northern Ashijan loomed in the distance, a green wall of mystery and danger. Ferin squared his shoulders, determination overriding his fear. Whatever lay ahead, whatever forces were at play, he would face them. He had come too far to turn back now.\n\n\"Rodrick,\" he said, his voice low and serious, \"I need you to be on your guard. I have a feeling things are about to get a lot more complicated.\"\n\nRodrick's eyes widened, but he nodded, for once at a loss for words.\n\nAs they pressed on towards the jungle, Ferin couldn't shake the feeling that they were walking into something far bigger than they had ever imagined.

He has to make this. Pause occurs as the two stay silent a second.\n\n\n*... Go home, or learn how to exorcize ghosts? This... this is a lot... I...* Zita nervously thinks, trying to figure out what is right.\n\nSylvie sorely sighs in response to this.\n\n\"... I\"ll give you time. Check back with you in fifteen minutes. Think long and hard. Sorry.\"\n\nAnd with that announcement, Sylvie vanishes behind the bars and leaves Zita on his own. He thinks long and hard about this decision.\n\n*... I... I want to leave. I want to go home, I want to hang out with Pip, go to school, go to bed, I want to pretend none of this ever happened! I want to live an ordinary life and study, I don\"t want to be involved in any of this, it\"s all... but... I... I will be seeing these ghosts everywhere, whether I stay or not. I\"ll have to witness them, but not know a thing about them or why they\"re here.

I want to see it, I have to, but... urgh… how did I end up in this mess?*\n\nZita ponders the dilemma more, staring at the floor with locked hands as he argues with himself, wondering how he got into this mess and if he's still dreaming. He can't decide if the fifteen minutes felt like 15 seconds or 15 hours, but they end either way and the strange woman is back. She stands before him with crossed arms for a second before asking the big question.\n\n\"... so? You made your choice?\" a pause washes over the two, but Zita's lip parts and the answer emerges.\n\n\"... yeah... I... I think I have.\" Zita responds, anxiety and caution in his tone. He gulps before sealing his fate, giving the verdict on his life;\n\n\"I... I want to learn about ghosts. and what to do about them.\"\n\nWith that response, Sylvie gives a confident smile as the cell bars retract and upward, rising and letting Zita out of the cage.\n\n\"... Atta boy. Let\"s get started.\" a proud smirk across her face as Zita steps out into the light, a nervous smile across his face as he follows the woman outside the cage.\n\n\"Now, lets begin!\" Sylvie enthusiastically declares as they walk out of a white-plastered cottage that you wouldn\"t guess to be the front for an underground holding facility. Before the two is a shiny black car.\n\n\"... s... so, where do we... start?\" Zita asks Sylvie in a shy tone.\n\n\"Well~ first, it would be smart for you to get some first hand experience. You\"ll be assisting us on an exorcism! We\"ll tell you more when we get there.\" The black car\"s back door opens to reveal a woman in the same robe he saw the previous person wear, but with their hood down. She has lengthy raven black hair in a braided ponytail and small facial features. Her eyes widen from shock as she sees the boy in front of the car.\n\n\"Oh- he actually took the option?\" The driver states in a surprised tone before clearing her voice. The black haired girl stares at him with a shocked look. Zita replies with an awkward lopsided smile.\n\n\"As I said, I teach this one. You\"ll be her classmate, if that\"s alright. And if it ain\"t, sorry, not much to do about it.\" Sylvie says as she walks to the shotgun side of the car. Zita slowly takes a seat and gives a small wave to the girl.\n\n\"... what… are you doing here?\" She scowls at the boy next to her.\n\n\"... I... I want to learn about the ghosts...\"\n\n\"I...\" the girl stares at Sylvie with an annoyed look and crosses her arms in a sulk. The driver in the front, a woman with a blonde bob cut turns the keys as the car rattles, starting and beginning to move not long after.\n\n*... the awkwardness hurts, I... yikes. How am I already regretting this, before I've even met a ghost nonetheless?*\n\nThe road trip that follows amplifies the awkwardness to levels that the 2 didn\"t even know was possible. The driver remains quiet for most of the journey, whilst Sylvie hums to the radio. Meanwhile, the two in the back don\"t even say a word, the girl in the back staring out the window at the world passing by whilst Zita thinks of anything to say. Finally, Sylvie speaks.\n\n\"Oh- right. Zita, this is Assira Kaguya. Assira, Zita! Both of you will be learning from me during this crash course, so get along nicely!\" Sylvie informs.\n\n\"Y- yes, miss!\" Zira nods as he responds, talking anxiously.\n\n\"... yes, miss...\" Assira responds, sounding like she\"s talking through gritted teeth, making Zita even more uncomfortable.\n\nThe black car travels quite some distance, the destination leads to the people inside weaving through the Welsh countryside, tracing the roads lining the valleys. The long journey gives Zita a lot of time to think.\n\n*... What... What just happened? Why did it happen? How did it happen? Did... did I fall down the stairs in the bunker and this is all one big concussion dream? Would make more sense than being suffocated by thin air and the creepy statue taking a rock to my head... not to mention what the hell this creepy woman was talking about, aether and plasm and... look, I\"ll just... go with it. I have to know. I\"ll regret it if I don\"t.*\n\n\"So, Zita!\" Sylvie announces to the boy. \"We will be going on a mission, learning first hand. We\"ll help, of course.\"\n\n\"W- why so soon?\" Zita asks.\n\n\"Aether comes from aetherplasm, which spawns from negative emotions. Mainly the fight or flight response. The best way to unlock aether control is through life or death stress!\" Sylvie talks about life or death as naturally as she breathes, prompting Zita to develop an expression of shock and fear.\n\n\"B- but I don\"t want to die!-\"\n\n\"You won\"t~ you\"ll live! We\"ll be here to protect you!\"\n\n\"... o... okay...\" sweat rolls down Zita\"s face as he finds that cold comfort. After this exchange, the driver speaks.\n\n\"Miss, if you may debrief...\" the driver asks Sylvie.\n\n\"Rrrright people! Here\"s the summary of what\"s happened and whatcha gonna do. whatcha need to know; This mineshaft is known to be haunted.\" The lady says, as if what she is saying is completely standard to the two in the back. Assira simply nods with a blank face, robe hood down. Meanwhile, Zira is still taking time to adjust.\n\n\"Now then, this mineshaft...\" Sylvie continues whilst twiddling with the branch in her hair, twisting it in her locks. \"It all started in the 1900\"s, dead early in it too. A mines owner did not pay enough on safety precautions because \"mah monah.\"\" She breaks up the serious topic with a goofy voice when talking about the money. \"Due to this oversight, an coaldust incident and poor scaffolding caused portions of shaft to collapse, burying the miners still inside.\" Sylvie explains this tragedy in a casual and nonchalant way, resting her arm against the top of her seat whilst talking to the two students. \"Ok then, Assira!\" The teacher says to the girl, raising their index finger as she talks. \"Pop quiz! Our new friend here just learned about ghosts and aether existing, so I\"ll test your knowledge and give our new guy here a crash course. Got it?\"\n\n\"Understood, miss.\" The robed girl responds in a stoic and formal tone, if annoyed by their teacher\"s silly tone. Zita just sits there, a bit concerned as he twitchily nods and prepares to listen.\n\n\"Now! How are ghosts formed?\" The teacher asks.\n\n\"Simple. Negative emotions radiate from living people in the form of an energy known as aetherplasm. Said energy then imprinting itself on surrounding objects and ground. human souls transfer into aetherplasm during traumatic deaths. Eventually the aetherplasm in the ground attracts each other, assumes the identity of the negative emotion and collective thoughts that created it, and begins to operate as a ghost. It will also attract negative emotions linked to the identity it assumed.\"\n\n\"Ding ding ding! Full marks! You got all that...? sorry, didn\"t get your last name.\" The teacher turns to Zita, her jovial attitude turning to a more curious one when asking the boy.\n\nThe boy turns to her nervously and stutters; \"U-uh, it\"s malik, miss... Zita Malik. and, yeah, I think I understand... so manifestations of bad memories and fears, in short?\"\n\nThe teacher looks to the ceiling whilst thinking about that name, as if remembering something. \"Zita, huh... I like it! Anyway, yeah, that\"s a good way to put it!\" The teacher responds, then clicks her fingers.\n\n\"Anyway, people like us- those who have been touched by aether by birth or events- can manipulate our aetherplasm to create aether, a more controllable form, the soul made plasma. Plus, access to aether allows us to perceive ghosts, something normal people can\"t. Also, We can manipulate our aether in many ways, everyone has their own individual method and technique. I\"m sure you\"ll see it from Assira. On your mission\" The teacher explains, then turns to the girl in question. \"Speaking of, Assira. I trust you to look after our new recruit. You got him into this mess, so I trust you to look out for him whilst here.\" The teacher states in a more serious tone, yet still informal. Assira's eyes widen in frustration and she goes to speak back, but doesn\"t open her mouth.\n\n\"Yes, miss...\" she responds, tone radiating frustration. Zita watches, quietly, not wanting to say anything on the matter...\n\nZita\"s head is on fire and his stomach is in knots as he waits for the journey to end. He didn\"t know what the hell he\"s done to deserve being in this situation other than to be curious, but...\n\n*I made this bed, guess it\"s time to lie in it!* he figured begrudgingly.\n\nAfter an hour, the car pulls through an rickety metal fence, driving through a blackened and coal dust covered road and parks in the middle of an abandoned early 1900\"s coal mine. Derelict minecarts and eroded railways line the floor, scaffold towers flake rust and stand with wheels atop and dusty chimneys litter the skyline, the glum scenery emphasized by the signature welsh clouds hanging overhead. The students walk out the back of the car, Assira hastily slamming the door behind them and into Zita whom blocks it with an alarmed expression. The teacher walks out and leans against the car\"s driver side door and crosses their arms, the driver opening the window.\n\n\"We\"ll be out here standing guard. If something comes up, I\"ll be there in a split. I trust you though, you two got this. best of luck!\" The teacher says to her pupils, smiling and with a cheery tone.\n\n\"Good luck, you two.\" The driver says, slightly more detached yet hopefully as the two begin to approach the pits.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Zita and Assira approach the entrance of the mineshaft, the dark opening looming before them. Zita's heart races as he realizes the gravity of the situation he's put himself in. Assira, on the other hand, maintains a stoic expression, though her clenched fists betray her tension.\n\n\"So... um, what exactly are we supposed to do?\" Zita asks nervously, breaking the silence between them.\n\nAssira sighs, clearly annoyed at having to explain. \"We're here to exorcise the ghosts. That means we need to find the source of the haunting and neutralize it.\"\n\nAs they step into the darkness of the mine, Zita fumbles for his phone to use as a light. Assira produces a small, glowing orb from her robe pocket, illuminating their path with an eerie blue light.\n\n\"Is that... aether?\" Zita asks, fascinated despite his fear.\n\n\"Yes,\" Assira replies curtly. \"Now be quiet and stay alert. We don't want to attract unwanted attention.\"\n\nThey descend deeper into the mine, the air growing thick with dust and an oppressive sense of dread. Zita's breath quickens as he notices shadows moving at the edge of their light, always just out of sight.\n\nSuddenly, a low moan echoes through the tunnel. Zita freezes, his eyes wide with terror. Assira grabs his arm, pulling him behind her as she faces the direction of the sound.\n\n\"Remember what Sylvie said,\" Assira whispers. \"Focus on your fear. Try to feel the aether within you.\"\n\nZita closes his eyes, concentrating on the rapid beating of his heart and the cold sweat on his skin. To his surprise, he feels a warmth spreading from his core, a strange energy coursing through his veins.\n\nA translucent figure materializes before them – a miner, his face contorted in agony. Assira steps forward, her hands glowing with blue energy.\n\n\"Zita, watch closely,\" she commands. \"This is how we exorcise a ghost.\"\n\nAssira begins to chant in a language Zita doesn't understand, her voice resonating with power. The ghost writhes and shrieks, its form becoming less stable.\n\nSuddenly, the ghost lunges at Zita. Acting on instinct, he throws his hands up in defense. To his amazement, a burst of golden light erupts from his palms, pushing the ghost back.\n\nAssira's eyes widen in surprise, but she quickly refocuses on her task. With a final, powerful word, she sends a wave of blue energy at the ghost, causing it to dissipate with a wail.\n\n\"That... that was incredible,\" Zita gasps, staring at his hands in wonder.\n\nAssira nods, a hint of respect in her eyes. \"Not bad for a beginner. But we're not done yet. The source of the haunting is still here.\"\n\nAs they continue deeper into the mine, Zita feels more confident, the warmth of his newly discovered aether giving him strength. They encounter more ghosts, each one more aggressive than the last. Zita learns quickly, mimicking Assira's techniques and developing his own.\n\nFinally, they reach a large cavern. In the center stands a grotesque amalgamation of ghostly miners, their forms twisted together in a nightmarish sculpture of pain and anger.\n\n\"This is it,\" Assira says grimly. \"The collective consciousness of all the miners who died here. We need to separate them and exorcise them individually.\"\n\nZita nods, determination replacing his earlier fear. \"I'm ready. Let's do this.\"\n\nAs they begin their most challenging exorcism yet, Zita realizes that his life has irrevocably changed. He's stepped into a world of danger and wonder, and there's no going back. But as he works alongside Assira, feeling the power of aether flow through him, he knows he's made the right choice.\n\nHours later, exhausted but triumphant, they emerge from the mine. Sylvie greets them with a proud smile, noting the new bond between her students.\n\n\"Well done, both of you,\" she says. \"Zita, you've shown remarkable potential. And Assira, excellent work guiding our new recruit.\"\n\nAs they drive back, Zita reflects on his journey. He's discovered a hidden world, unlocked a power within himself, and even started to form a tentative friendship with Assira. Whatever challenges lie ahead, he's ready to face them, armed with his newfound knowledge and abilities.\n\nThe car disappears into the misty Welsh countryside, carrying Zita towards his new life as an exorcist-in-training.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation is mostly coherent, maintaining the plot, character development, and tone of the original story.

{"id": "text_completion_012", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Fort Spencer was supposed to be a place to retire. It was where the only war games were Risk and Battleship. Training exercises consisted of deciding to get out of bed at the right opportunity. The staff catered to the officers every need. So why did command give them a fleet of submarines.\n\n\n\"There must\"ve been a mistake.\" Captain Ryan Olaberria was glad to have been posted at Fort Spencer. No other fort in the nation had a captain as its highest officer. Half of the postings technically outranked, but they took the demotion for less responsibility. There was little risk of handling combat, it had no towns within its jurisdiction, and there was no risk of demerits.\n\n\"I called the commander. Apparently, these vessels are from pre-war times, and they want us to test them in our lake.\" Lieutenant Lilly Jones was the opposite of the captain. She hated the serene and peaceful Fort Spencer. She wanted a posting that involved adventure and combat. On her first tour, there was an incident involving a sock and a jammed rifle. From that point forward, she was trapped in servicing old soldiers. \"Also, they are not submarines. They are technically submersibles. They aren\"t self-sufficient at all. Most weren\"t even armed until the Mieran war, and the aliens unleashed who knows what in the seas.\" Lieutenant Jones smiled at that thought. She had romantic notions of war. It was easy to hold such ideals when one had been routinely denied the battlefield.\n\n\"So we don\"t have to use them. Just test them to make sure they work?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"That\"s correct.\"\n\n\"Do we have any guidance or timetable with regards to the submersibles?\"\n\n\"Command gave us free reign. They might come by a few years from now.\"\n\nCaptain Jacob smiled and scratched his chin. The retirees were getting bored with the standard activities and diet. It was why they were all so willing to believe that Pacifico City lie a while back. They needed something new.\n\n\"Perhaps we could define function as taking these submersibles out for a few joyrides. I\"m sure they\"ll be quite enjoyable,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"Will these joyrides be able to test the capabilities of the weapons?\"\n\n\"Who cares about that? Command asked if they worked. We can turn them all back over and say they swim fine,\" Captain Olaberria smiled. The lieutenant was angered that another weapon was going to be wasted for entertainment purposes. She desperately wanted to use the submersibles to their full power, but she knew that wasn\"t going to stand with the current situation.\n\n\"There\"s one problem,\" Ryan said. Lilly raised an eyebrow in the hopes that Ryan had a change of heart.\n\n\"If these submersibles break, that could kill several of the retirees that we need to keep alive.\"\n\n\"Darn, looks like your submersible ride idea was a bust.\" Lilly could hardly contain her excitement.\n\n\"No, it can be salvaged.\"\n\n\"I\"m not sure about that. The crafts were already salvaged.\"\n\n\"Someone needs to test them before we give them to the people that matter.\" Ryan scratched his chin. \"We can\"t do it ourselves. We can\"t lose any of the staff because they\"re needed to serve the retirees. What we need is competent, gullible idiots.\" Ryan\"s eyes widened as a thought hit him. \"We know exactly the right people.\"\n\n-\n\n\"Way to go Polly. Getting us in prison.\" Reid said. Olivia, Polly, Reid, and Jim were sitting around a small table. Frida was restrained to a wooden plank and a straitjacket behind them.\n\n\"They said that they had forgiven us. How would I know they changed their minds?\" Polly asked.\n\n\"Because if it involves you, the worst case scenario always happens. It\"s why I didn\"t want you opening the door,\" Olivia replied.\n\n\"What the-\" Polly stood up and put her hands on her hips. \"You told me to open the door.\"\n\n\"And look what happened. I think I broke a nail during the fight,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"I broke that guy\"s jaw,\" Frida smiled.\n\n\"We would\"ve won if someone hadn\"t given back a soldier their gun.\" Reid glared at Jim.\n\n\"What was I supposed to do? He asked me nicely,\" Jim said.\n\nCaptain Ryan chose that moment to enter the room. Frida squirmed and broke free of her restraints. She leapt to the captain with all the force her legs could generate. Lilly was excited by this conflict. Stepping in front of her captain, she pushed him to the ground and slapped Frida in the face midair. Frida collapsed on the ground and squirmed until she tripped her opponent. Lilly angled her fall to connect her fist directly with Frida\"s face. Frida retaliated by biting Lilly\"s knuckles. Guards rushed in to separate the two women.\n\n\"Let me go,\" Lilly smiled, \"I was winning.\"\n\n\"Release me from my restraints. Her fingers tasted good,\" Frida replied. Reid got out of his chair to help the captain up. When Ryan was standing, Reid pulled him close.\n\n\"I\"m not with her at all,\" Reid whispered, \"Hardly know her, please don\"t hold me accountable for her actions.\"\n\n\"Don\"t worry. Her initiative is exactly why I called you all in here. You have a talent for managing projects such as your resort,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"The resort was Polly\"s idea.\" Olivia held up an index finger. \"It was all her. I told her it was moronic, but she wouldn\"t listen,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Can you let him finish before accusing me?\" Polly asked.\n\n\"I think the resort was a great idea, but you all lacked resources.\"\n\n\"That\"s what I said.\" Reid wrapped his arm around Ryan\"s shoulders. Polly raised her hands in exasperation.\n\n\"I called you here to give you the tools and a task fitting of your skills which were demonstrated with my soldiers.\" Ryan glanced at Lilly.\n\n\"Wait a second, is this mission probably going to kill us all, and you called us here because you don\"t want to risk the lives of the people who mattered?\" Polly asked. Ryan blinked a few times before deciding that the has no idea how to lie properly.\n\n\"You got me. That is exactly why I brought you here.\"\n\n\"I\"m offended you would do that.\" Reid pushed him away. \"I have too much self-respect to be a sacrificial lamb in any form.\"\n\n\"You get to pilot a submersible,\" Ryan said. Everyone in the room held their breaths and stared at each other. Jim broke the silence first.\n\n\"That sounds fun,\" he said.\n\n\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story:\n\n\"Hold on,\" Olivia interjected, her eyes narrowing. \"What exactly do you mean by 'pilot a submersible'? And more importantly, what's the catch?\"\n\nCaptain Ryan cleared his throat, glancing briefly at Lieutenant Lilly, who was still nursing her bitten knuckles. \"Well, you see, we've recently acquired a fleet of pre-war submersibles. Command wants us to test them, but we can't risk our regular personnel.\"\n\n\"So you thought of us,\" Polly said, her voice a mixture of irritation and intrigue. \"How thoughtful.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Ryan continued, \"I'm not going to sugarcoat it. These submersibles haven't been used in years, and we're not entirely sure of their condition. But if you agree to help us test them, I can offer you a deal.\"\n\nReid leaned forward, his interest piqued. \"What kind of deal are we talking about here?\"\n\n\"Freedom,\" Ryan said simply. \"If you successfully test these submersibles and report back to us, I'll see to it that all charges against you are dropped. You'll be free to go.\"\n\nThe group exchanged glances, a mix of skepticism and hope on their faces. Even Frida, still restrained on the floor, had stopped squirming to listen.\n\n\"And if we refuse?\" Jim asked.\n\nLieutenant Lilly spoke up, her voice cold. \"Then you can enjoy an extended stay in our lovely prison facilities.\"\n\nPolly stood up, pacing the small room. \"So let me get this straight. You want us to risk our lives testing potentially dangerous underwater vessels, all so you can avoid endangering your own people?\"\n\n\"That's... one way to put it,\" Ryan admitted.\n\n\"I'm in,\" Frida said from the floor, surprising everyone. \"Anything's better than being strapped to this plank.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Jim added quickly. \"I've always wanted to pilot a submarine... or submersible, whatever.\"\n\nOlivia sighed, rubbing her temples. \"This is insane. But I suppose it's better than rotting in a cell.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to Reid and Polly. Reid shrugged. \"Well, if everyone else is doing it...\"\n\nPolly threw her hands up in exasperation. \"Fine! But I want it on record that I think this is a terrible idea.\"\n\nCaptain Ryan clapped his hands together, a relieved smile on his face. \"Excellent! We'll begin your training immediately. Lieutenant Lilly will oversee the operation.\"\n\nAs they were led out of the room, Polly whispered to Olivia, \"You realize this is probably going to end in disaster, right?\"\n\nOlivia nodded, a wry smile on her face. \"Of course. But when has that ever stopped us before?\"\n\nThe next few days were a whirlwind of activity. The group was given crash courses in submersible operations, underwater navigation, and basic maintenance. Lieutenant Lilly, much to her chagrin, was tasked with their training.\n\n\"No, no, NO!\" Lilly shouted, her face red with frustration. \"You can't just push all the buttons and hope for the best, Jim!\"\n\nJim sheepishly removed his hands from the control panel. \"Sorry, I got excited.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Frida was proving to be surprisingly adept at understanding the submersible's systems. \"It's just like hot-wiring a car,\" she explained, earning concerned looks from both Ryan and Lilly.\n\nAs the day of the test drew near, tensions began to rise. The reality of what they were about to do started to sink in.\n\n\"What if these things really don't work?\" Reid asked one evening as they sat around their makeshift common area. \"What if we end up at the bottom of the lake?\"\n\n\"Then I guess we'll have to hope these submersibles have good rescue pods,\" Polly replied, trying to sound more confident than she felt.\n\nThe morning of the test arrived, and the group stood on the shore of the lake, staring at the fleet of submersibles bobbing gently in the water. They looked old and worn, their once-sleek hulls now covered in patches of rust and algae.\n\nCaptain Ryan approached them, clipboard in hand. \"Alright, team. Today's the day. Remember your training, stick to the planned route, and most importantly, don't die. Any questions?\"\n\nOlivia raised her hand. \"Yes, just one. Are you absolutely sure this isn't some elaborate plan to get rid of us permanently?\"\n\nRyan chuckled nervously. \"Of course not. Now, off you go!\"\n\nAs they boarded their respective submersibles, Polly couldn't shake the feeling that they were making a huge mistake. But as she settled into the pilot's seat and began the startup sequence, she felt a small thrill of excitement.\n\n\"Well,\" she muttered to herself, \"at least it'll be an adventure.\"\n\nWith a series of splashes, the submersibles disappeared beneath the surface of the lake, leaving Captain Ryan and Lieutenant Lilly standing on the shore, both wondering if they'd made the right decision.\n\n\"Do you think they'll be okay?\" Ryan asked, a hint of concern in his voice.\n\nLilly shrugged. \"Who knows? But one thing's for sure – it won't be boring.\"\n\nAs the submersibles descended into the murky depths, none of them could have predicted the bizarre and dangerous adventures that awaited them beneath the surface of Fort Spencer's seemingly peaceful lake.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

My teacher, Miss Lawrence, was looking at me with slight exasperation. Her red locks bobbed slightly as she shook her head left to right, sighing slightly she continued the lecture, talking about old engineering feats, underground tunnels and the sort. I heard a few snickers around me from my class-mates. It\"s easy to take sleep for granted when you get plenty of it, a fact I\"ve become very aware of the last two weeks.\n\n-.. I want those assignments on my desk by Monday\n\nShe said\n\n-And make sure you all get enough rest\n\nShe finished, with a pointed look at me. I took it in stride, it\"s not like it\"s my fault I hardly get any sleep..\n\n-Hey, Simon!\n\nFred, school boxing star and all around good-guy, yelled behind me as I was getting my bag out of my locker.\n\n-You gotta stop dozing off like that, you\"re gonna get shit if it keeps up\n\n-Yeah, yeah, I know..\n\n-What\"s up, anyways? You got a new girl you haven\"t told me about, keeping you up at night?\n\nHe asked with a coy smile. I gave him a sly grin\n\n-Nah man, that sounds like a good problem to have..\n\nI scratched my neck and looked down at my feet\n\n-It\"s a bit embarrassing actually..\n\nHe looked looked slightly concerned\n\n-What is? You know you can tell me anything, still haven\"t told a soul about the-\n\nHe scanned the surroundings quickly, making sure no one was in earshot\n\n-\"undearwear incident\" in second grade\n\nHe loved to bring up that example whenever he wanted to prove his reliability, which is unnecessary since it has never been in question during all the years I\"ve known him.\n\n-It\"s night terrors\n\nI said\n\n-But it\"s more than that. I think they\"re over, but then they\"re not.. I wake from a nightmare, drenched in sweat, heart racing, trying to calm myself down. Memories of the dream fading, and I see shadows out of the corner of my eye, moving away from me. I try and focus on them, and they fade into the background.\n\nFred looks quizzical for a moment, then he asks\n\n-Is it like sleep paralysis? I\"ve never had it, but I\"ve heard some really freaky stories..\n\n-Nah, it\"s not that. I\"ve had them a lot as a kid, you probably heard most of those stories from me.. No, this is different. I can move while its going on, and I don\"t feel the dread I\"ve come to associated with sleep paralysis. It\"s freaky still, but in another way. I feel hollow whenever I wake up, like I\"m missing something. It lasts all the way up to around lunch.\n\nEven in the light of day, the topic was getting on my nerves. Fred seemed to sense I was uncomfortable with digging too deep into this at the moment\n\n-Sounds rough\n\nHe said\n\n-Nothing a bit of practice won\"t solve. See you there?\n\nHe asked, slapping my arm\n\n-You bet\n\nI slapped his arm back\n\nA few hours, and several bruises later, I was sitting out in my garden on the green grass, birds chirping in the background, late spring wind fanning my face and hair.\n\n-Watcha\" doing?\n\nMy annoying sister, Sarah, chirped up.\n\n-Meditating. Same as yesterday. And the day before that.\n\nShe loved to find new ways to annoy me, currently it was asking questions she already knew the answer to, but that in itself isn\"t good enough. She needs to know I know she knows the answer.\n\n-Watcha\" doing that for?\n\n-To get away from you, scram!\n\nI snapped at her, giving her an evil look.\n\nShe scrambled away, giggling all the way.\n\nMeditation, I\"d started doing it a while ago, when I was still fantasizing about the idea of becoming a pro-boxer, looking for any edge I could eek out in order to compete with Fred. It was supposed to increase focus in the ring. I bet it does wonders, but I gave up on it on too soon to figure. Now, now I\"m doing it out of desperation. Maybe my night terrors were because of a worried mind? Meditation calms the mind, so maybe it\"ll cure this problem?\n\nI felt a buzz in my pocket, it\"s a text from Alyssa in the group chat\n\n-You guys ready?\n\nShe asked\n\n-Shit is it now?!?\n\nFred responded\n\n-I\"ll bring snacks\n\nHenri chimed in, always prepared for pretty much any situation, no matter how unlikely\n\n-Yeah, usual spot in 15?\n\nI typed\n\nAlyssa, one year older than the rest of us, senior in highschool, had a bit of an obsession with the occult. Well, obsession is a bit harsh, but she\"s fascinated by it, reading up on stuff, buying tarot cards, crystals and herbs used in different rituals. She found some fortune-teller/medium on craigslist, and she badgered the rest of us to join her on her expedition there.\n\nApproximately 15 minutes later I approached the diner/convince store named Shop\"N\"Stop, Fred and Henri already waiting by the rundown, faded exterior of the place who couldn\"t make its mind up about what it was. The shop is alright, got the necessities at a reasonable price, the diner on the other hand.. only one I know who haven\"t been running to the toilet for a week after eating there is Alyssa, and it\"s hardly fair to count her since she\"s some kind of freak of nature when it comes to dodging sickness, and most bad things now that I think about it.\n\n-Where\"s our heroine, dragging us out at this ungodly hour to do God knows what, with forces and powers beyond our comprehension to witness, let alone understand?\n\nI waxed poetically at the two in greeting. Henri chuckles and adjusts his glasses, while Fred smiles and looks behind me\n\n-T\"was three hours before midnight, sun\"s last rays still sparkling. Hardly an ungodly hour\n\nA playful voice behind me, coming closer, said. I turn around and see her, auburn hair playing lightly in the slight wind, eyes glimmering a greyish green in the afromentioned sun, set over the barely visible freckles dotting her nose and visible cheekbones.\n\nYeah, she\"s a real looker, and I\"m well aware of that. She\"s the standard I judge other beauties by, and it\"s anything but a fair standard. My feelings towards her is more like that of a sister, only she\"s less annoying, knowing someone since kindergarten kinda does that. There\"s days I\"ve wondered, even fantasized about the two of us, once her blooming beauty was becoming apparent even to me. But I\"d make it weird if I made a move, and she sees me as a brother as well, she\"s said it in the past..\n\n-Considering our mission this evening, anything after noon is an ungodly hour\n\nHenri, the only staunch atheist and unbeliever in anything paranormal, intoned. Despite his scepticism, he\"s the most easily scared of the bunch.\n\n-Wouldn\"t be you if you weren\"t the last one here\n\nI smiled at Alyssa\n\nFred came up to us and put his arms around our shoulders\n\n-Alright birdies, let\"s get a move on. I\"ve got a pizza with my name on it at home. It\"s very impatient, can\"t wait to see the insides of my stomach\n\nWe got a move on, going towards the older parts of town, the Shop\"N\"Stop marking the end of the newer, better maintained parts of town.\n\nHenri glanced around nervously\n\n-So where\"d you say you found this guy? Or woman? Or whatever?\n\nHe asked\n\n-Woman\n\nAlyssa responded, giving him a quick smile\n\n-Found her on craigslist, she\"s a bit expensive but I think it\"s worth it. I\"ve only tried cheap mediums so far, and the price really reflected the quality of their work\n\nShe huffed, looking slightly annoyed, then she turned to the group and beamed towards us\n\n-Good thing I got you guys to share the fee with\n\nHenri huffed incredulously\n\n-You mean you got us to badger until we finally agree to do what you want?\n\nFred looked to Henri\n\n-Hey, you let her talk you into this, no use complaining about it now\n\nHe said, not able to completely hide the slight tone of defeat in his own voice.\n\n-I\"m actually looking forward to this\n\nI interjected\n\n-Not that I believe this is anything but a scam, but I\"d say it\"s worth 25 bucks for one evenings worth of entertainment, I\"m curious to figure out what kind of tricks she\"ll use to try and trick us..\n\n-Alright guys, that\"s enough\n\nAlyssa said, looking at us, brow slightly furrowed\n\n-I want to do this with you, but if you\"re going to crap all over it before you\"ve even tried it you\"re just gonna ruin it, for me, for you, for everyone. Just have an open mind\n\nShe looked at us pleadingly\n\n-Alright\n\nI looked at her\n\n-The final reason I think this\"ll be worth $50 of my own money, is that on the off chance that this is real, I\"d pay that sum several times over\n\nAlyssa\"s entire being lit up as she smiled at me\n\n-That\"s the spirit, we\"re almost there\n\n-Simon\n\n-zzt..fffzzZzz -static-\n\n-SIMON\n\nThe scream echoed in my ears. My balance is off, the world is shaking. Fred is shaking me, looking me in the eyes.\n\n-Where\"d you go buddy?\n\nHe asked, looking me in the eyes intensely. I looked to Alyssa, worry written all over her face, rarely seen wrinkles making an appearance on her face, Henri alternating glances at me and the ground, fidgeting with something in his hands.\n\n-I.. I don\"t... There was something.. over there.\n\nI said, pointing towards the side of an old, dilapidated house, overgrown weeds all over the lawn and house itself. The dizziness was starting to pass\n\n-There was a shadow. Something moved, I got all dizzy.. It\"s gone now.\n\nFred looked really worried now\n\n-Shadow?\n\nHe asked\n\n-It\"s fine, just the sleep deprivation doing a number on me, I can handle it\n\n-We can do this another time, if you need to go home and rest\n\nAlyssa chimed in, worry still apparent on her face, she\"d been looking forward to this for over a week, she\"d always put her friends wellbeing above her own interest, I didn\"t want to let her down\n\n-It\"s fine, I\"m feeling much better already\n\n-Here, take this\n\nHenri reached out a hand with a piece of candy, meant to raise the blood sugar of those with diabetes, I bit down on it and smiled towards the group\n\n-Good as new, let\"s do this\n\nThey looked unconvinced, but agreed\n\n-This is it\n\nAlyssa said, looking at the very same dilapidated house\n\n-Only one thing left to do then\n\nI said with much more bravado than I felt, a sense of dread growing in me as I marched up towards the overgrown house...\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story:\n\nAs we approached the dilapidated house, the sense of dread in my stomach grew stronger. The overgrown weeds seemed to reach out, grasping at our ankles as we made our way up the cracked concrete path. The paint on the house was peeling, revealing rotted wood underneath. The windows were dark, some cracked, others boarded up entirely.\n\nAlyssa led the way, her excitement palpable despite the eerie atmosphere. Fred walked close behind me, his usual bravado replaced by cautious glances. Henri brought up the rear, muttering something about tetanus and building code violations.\n\nAs we reached the porch, the old wood creaked ominously under our feet. Alyssa raised her hand to knock, but before she could, the door swung open with a low groan. A woman stood in the doorway, her silver hair wild and unkempt, her eyes a piercing blue that seemed to look right through us.\n\n\"Welcome,\" she said, her voice raspy yet somehow melodic. \"I've been expecting you.\"\n\nWe exchanged glances, a mixture of excitement and apprehension on our faces. Alyssa stepped forward, introducing us one by one. The woman, who called herself Madame Zora, nodded at each of us, her gaze lingering on me a moment longer than the others.\n\nAs we entered the house, the musty smell of age and decay hit us. The interior was dimly lit by candles, casting long shadows on the walls. Madame Zora led us to a circular table in what must have once been a living room. A crystal ball sat in the center, surrounded by various trinkets and herbs.\n\n\"Please, sit,\" she said, gesturing to the chairs around the table.\n\nWe took our seats, the tension in the air palpable. Madame Zora began to speak, her voice taking on a rhythmic quality as she explained the process of contacting the spirit world. I found myself drawn in, despite my initial skepticism.\n\nAs she began the séance, the candles flickered, and a chill ran through the room. I felt a familiar dizziness creeping in, similar to what I'd experienced outside. I gripped the edge of the table, trying to steady myself.\n\nSuddenly, Madame Zora's eyes rolled back, and she began to speak in a voice that wasn't her own. \"Simon,\" the voice said, causing me to jolt in my seat. \"We've been trying to reach you.\"\n\nMy friends looked at me in shock, but I couldn't focus on them. The room seemed to spin, and shadows danced at the edges of my vision. I heard whispers, indistinct at first, but growing clearer.\n\n\"The veil is thin,\" the voice continued through Madame Zora. \"You've been seeing glimpses, haven't you? The shadows in the night, the feeling of something missing.\"\n\nI nodded, unable to speak. The others sat frozen, watching the scene unfold.\n\n\"You have a gift, Simon. A connection to the other side. But it comes with a price. The nightmares, the exhaustion - it's your mind trying to process what your soul already knows.\"\n\nI felt a weight lift from my chest, a sense of understanding washing over me. The sleepless nights, the strange visions - they weren't just random occurrences. They meant something.\n\nSuddenly, Madame Zora gasped, her eyes returning to normal. She looked at me with a mixture of awe and concern. \"I've never experienced anything like that before,\" she said, her voice shaky.\n\nAs we left the house, my mind was reeling. My friends peppered me with questions, but I couldn't find the words to explain what had happened. Even Henri, the skeptic, was uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nThat night, as I lay in bed, I didn't fear sleep for the first time in weeks. Instead, I felt a sense of anticipation. As I drifted off, I saw the shadows again, but this time, I didn't try to focus on them. Instead, I let them come, ready to embrace whatever they might reveal.\n\nThe next morning, I woke feeling more refreshed than I had in months. The hollow feeling was gone, replaced by a sense of purpose. I knew that this was just the beginning of a journey - one that would lead me to understand the gift I apparently possessed.\n\nAs I got ready for school, I caught a glimpse of movement in my mirror. But this time, instead of fear, I felt a spark of excitement.

{"id": "text_completion_014", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Once upon a time there was a young boy who had nothing. Truthfully, he had less than nothing. He lived in a small town full of werewolves, witches, and ghosts galore, but he was human, one of the Forsaken. To make matters worse, he was an orphan.\n\n\nOne particularly bad day, he had an idea. On the outskirts of town lived the vampires. And vampires take care of their own. They don't steal food or clothes like desperate orphans do. No, they keep each other well fed and comfortable. And the boy yearned for that.\n\nSo, later that night, when all the other orphans were asleep, he crept out of the orphanage and turned towards the hills outside of town. He knew in his gut that this would be his last night alone.\n\n• • •\n\nOnce upon a time a vampire ruled atop a lonely throne. She was respected by many, but loved by few, and of those few she trusted even less. She knew the truth, you see. She knew that vampires are not kind, nor are they loyal. It's true that they guard each other from the outside, but they will turn on one another in a heartbeat. So she ruled with an iron fist, fearing that if she loosened her grip, she would lose everything.\n\nThis made certain aspects of her unlife hard. After all, she might not care that the blood tribute was a pint short, but if she didn't bring retribution, the others would challenge her power. And when less benign rulers came into power, more than a few pints of blood ran in the streets. Her strict rules made things hard for her at times. The day she discovered a Forsaken in her home was one of those times.\n\n• • •\n\nCelia strode down a hall lit by dim torches. Despite their flames, the hall leading down into the dungeon was cold. Fitting for a place of sorrow and despair. Even though it stayed empty in recent times, the last tenant of the manor used the dank basement liberally, and she suspected that angry ghosts remained nearby. She was only going there now because of a summons from her most loyal servant and friend, Johnny, who supposedly discovered a Forsaken One trying to break in.\n\nShe wiped auburn hair from her face and straightened her black dress, then went around a corner into a side room where Johnny was waiting for her. The old man was wiry, and wore a suit that at one time would have been very nice, but time had not been kind to him or the suit.\n\n\"Ah, Miss Celia, thank you for coming. Here is the Forsaken One that I caught sneaking into the courtyard. He claims he's here to see you.\"\n\nCelia looked at the small, skinny boy, tied to a chair. His mouth was pressed into a thin line and his eyes looked nearly feral.\n\nCelia knelt down so she was eye level with the boy. \"Untie him. This is no way to treat a guest.\"\n\n\"But, Miss, we still don't know why he was sneaking in, and -\"\n\n\"He is a child, Johnny. Don't make me ask again.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"Let's cut to the chase, why are you here?\" asked Celia.\n\nThe boy looked into her blood red eyes for a moment, then fearfully looked away. \"I w-want to be-become a vampire.\"\n\nCelia was taken aback. Sure, some people wanted the life of a vampire, but they were few and far between. None of them had ever been so young.\n\n\"Tell me, boy, how old are you?\"\n\nThe boy looked puzzled. \"Thirteen. Why?\"\n\n\"A thirteen year old boy breaks into my home and says he wants to be a vampire. That's a first. It's also a good way to get yourself killed. Be glad that Johnny found you. A lesser vampire would have drained you there and then.\"\n\nThe boy gulped. \"Well, will you make me a vampire?\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Johnny. \"Vampirism isn't a jacket you can take on and off whenever you feel like it! It's a curse that you have to live with forever. To turn you at thirteen years old would be cruel! You should have more sense than to ask for this.\"\n\nCelia examined the boy closer. His clothes were raggedy and patched. Bruises covered just about every surface of his body. As soon as Johnny rose his voice, the boy winced.\n\nCelia lowered her voice to just above a whisper. \"Tell me, why do you want to be a vampire?\"\n\nThe boy rubbed his wrists. \"I thought if I became a vampire you might take care of me, then I wouldn't have to go back to the orphanage.\"\n\n\"Why don't you tell me about the orphanage,\" prompted Celia.\n\n\"I don't like it there. Helga is mean to us. She doesn't give us much food, and then the other kids steal mine because they're hungry too. She makes us work all day, and if we don't do enough, she makes us sleep in the floor.\"\n\n\"Do you have a name, boy?\" asked Johnny.\n\nThe boy nodded. \"My name is Cur. Or at least, that's what people call me. Helga says that's my name because no one would ever want me.\"\n\nShe felt for the boy, but years of hardening herself kept any emotions from showing through. \"Let me tell you a story, Cur. A long time ago, a young girl lived happily with her family. They lived in fear because they were Forsaken, but she didn't understand that. She was happy.\n\n\"One day, a visitor came. What she didn't know was that every month her parents paid a 'protection tax' to the vampire lord. They didn't pay in time, so he came to visit. The little girl, hiding in a closet, heard the sounds of her parents dying. Then he found her.\n\n\"He told her that her family broke the rules, and that meant they had to pay the price, even her. She had two options. Become a servant in his house, or die.\"\n\nCur was shaking now, and spoke with barely a whisper. \"What did she choose?\"\n\nCelia leaned in close. \"I chose to live.\"\n\nShe backed away, then drew a dagger that was hidden away in her clothes. She held it to Cur's throat, and a small trickle of blood came out.\n\n\"You broke the rules, Cur, and everyone must pay the price. Even orphans. So I'll give you the same choice that was given to me. Stay here, in my house, and be my servant, or I'll give you a swift death. It's up to you.\"\n\nIt was the only option. She couldn't let him go, or she would look weak, and weak vampires don't survive. But she knew by the fire in his eyes that this boy would never choose death.\n\nCur looked at the blood pooling on the gleaming blade. \"If I stay here, you won't send me back to the orphanage, right?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay. I'll do whatever you want, whenever you want. I swear I'll make you proud.\"\n\nCelia withdrew the blade. She wiped the blade clean, then stowed it away. Then she turned away, but stopped at the door.\n\n\"Johnny, show him to the servant's quarters and get him something to eat. Oh, and Cur, you need to know something.\"\n\nCur mindlessly held the cut on his neck, but looked up to Celia expectantly.\n\n\"A cur tends to be unwanted, but they are stronger because of it. And they don't hesitate to lash out at anything causing them pain. Make your name a strength, and no one can use it against you.\"\n\n• • •\n\nOnce upon a time there was a wicked woman who ran an orphanage. She was cruel and heartless, and all the kids feared her. One night, a little fiend of a child ran away, but she didn't care about him. She was just angry that one of her little workers had disappeared.\n\nThat night, the child rested easy. He had a bed all to himself, and a hot meal made it even better. And while he was dreaming, the wicked woman had an unexpected visitor.\n\nNo one knows exactly what happened to her that night. Some say she was paid well to leave town. Others say she had a secret lover and the two of them eloped. But the people on the edge of town have a different theory. For they heard the screams that night, and they found what was left the next morning. But the exact story matters not, for the wicked woman was never seen again.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Under Celia's stern but fair guidance, he learned the ways of the vampire household, becoming an indispensable member of her staff. His loyalty to Celia never wavered, even as he witnessed the cruel politics and backstabbing nature of vampire society.\n\nOne night, as Cur was tending to his duties in the great hall, he overheard a hushed conversation between two visiting vampires.\n\n\"The time has come,\" one whispered. \"Celia's iron grip has weakened. We strike at dawn.\"\n\nCur's heart raced. He slipped away unnoticed and rushed to Celia's chambers. \"My lady,\" he said, bowing low. \"There's a plot against you. They plan to attack at dawn.\"\n\nCelia's eyes flashed with anger, but her voice remained calm. \"I've long expected this day would come. Thank you, Cur. Your loyalty will not be forgotten.\"\n\nAs the sky began to lighten, a group of rebel vampires stormed the manor. But Celia was ready. With Cur by her side, she fought fiercely, her centuries of experience evident in every move. Cur, though human, proved his worth, using his knowledge of the house to outmaneuver the attackers.\n\nIn the heat of battle, Cur found himself face-to-face with a snarling vampire. As the creature lunged for his throat, Celia appeared, driving a stake through its heart. But not before its fangs grazed Cur's neck, drawing blood.\n\nWhen the dust settled and the rebels lay defeated, Celia turned to Cur. \"You're injured,\" she said, her voice tinged with concern.\n\nCur touched his neck, feeling the warmth of his own blood. \"It's nothing, my lady. I'm just glad you're safe.\"\n\nCelia studied him for a long moment. \"You've proven yourself time and again, Cur. You've earned the right to choose your own path. Do you still desire to become a vampire?\"\n\nCur hesitated, remembering the frightened boy he once was. \"No, my lady. I've learned that true strength comes not from immortality or power, but from loyalty and purpose. I am content as I am, serving you.\"\n\nA rare smile graced Celia's lips. \"Then you are wiser than most vampires I know. You will always have a place here, Cur, not as a servant, but as my trusted advisor.\"\n\nFrom that day forward, Cur stood proudly at Celia's side, a human among vampires, proving that the Forsaken could be just as formidable as any supernatural being. And in time, the vampires came to respect him, for they saw in Cur the loyalty and strength that many of their own kind lacked.\n\nAs for the town where Cur once lived, it slowly changed. The orphanage, under new management, became a place of hope rather than despair. And though the supernatural still ruled, the Forsaken found their voice, inspired by tales of a human who stood equal among vampires.\n\nCur never forgot where he came from, and each year, he would anonymously send gifts and resources to the orphanage. For he knew that sometimes, all it takes to change a life is one act of kindness, one opportunity to prove oneself.\n\nAnd so, the story of Cur, once a nameless orphan, now a respected advisor to the vampire queen, became a legend whispered among both the supernatural and the Forsaken. It was a tale of perseverance, of finding strength in one's identity, and of the power of loyalty to overcome even the deepest prejudices.\n\nIn the end, Cur had found more than just a home or a purpose. He had found a family in Celia and the others who accepted him, and in doing so, he had bridged two worlds that had long been divided.

{"id": "text_completion_015", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Jogon sat alone in his dimly lit office, immersed in the gentle hum of his data console and the incandescent glow of holographic projections. Images and reports of a peculiar species, known to the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations as Homo Sapiens, flickered across the room. They had officially been a part of the galactic community for barely fifty cycles.\n\n\nJogon, recently assigned to their sector, had spent the equivalent of several human years studying them - observing their behavior, assessing their cultural and technological advancements, and - more often than not - grappling with their irrationalities. He marveled at the complexity and sheer audacity of this species, his mandibles chittering in consternation as he mulled over their latest reports.\n\nThe Orthonex was currently on the brink of a dire war with the Vorlaxath Hive, a terrifying swarm-like species known for its relentless and insatiable hunger for planetary resources. The Hive was encroaching upon the peaceful territories of the Orthonex, and it was time to call upon all member species to contribute to the defense of the federation.\n\nHowever, Jogon was about to make a highly controversial recommendation. Staring at his console, he tapped his segmented fingers on the metallic surface, shaping his argument carefully. He was of the belief, one he was about to share with the federation\"s military committee, that the humans should not be invited to partake in this war.\n\n\"This is a species,\" he began, recording his statement, \"that\"s wild and reckless beyond any precedent we\"ve previously encountered.\" He selected a video clip from his database and broadcast it for his audience to see. The clip showed humans \"space skiing,\" an activity where an individual, wearing nothing but a thin suit, was tethered to a spaceship and then dragged through open space at alarming speeds.\n\nJogon continued, \"This reckless act of thrill-seeking, an activity that endangers their lives for mere entertainment, is only one example of their unhinged behavior. Their tendencies for warfare are similar. They are unpredictable, their actions often driven by passion and impulse rather than logic and strategy.\"\n\nHe paused, pondering over his next words, \"Their unpredictable nature is a risk we cannot afford to take. If we are to prevail against the Vorlaxath Hive, we need allies we can depend on, not wild cards that could just as easily implode our plans as help execute them.\"\n\nClosing his arguments, Jogon sent off his recommendation to the committee. He was confident his points were valid, but he was also aware of the Orthonex\"s egalitarian principle - every civilization must get a chance to defend the federation. Whether the committee agreed with him or not, one thing was certain - dealing with humans was like playing a game of Xuridian roulette, a game Jogon wasn\"t sure they could afford to play.\n\nThe Overseers, the ruling council of the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations, convened in their grand hall, a testament to the cooperation and technological prowess of countless star systems. Each Overseer, an emissary of their species, sat encased in individual chambers adapted to their unique biological needs. All attention was on the holographic representation of Jogon, his image flickering amidst them, his report a topic of heated discussion.\n\nCouncillor Dremik, a towering silicon-based entity from the rocky world of Qarn, projected a resonating rumble, the universal translator articulating his thoughts. \"The humans... they exhibit a peculiar inclination towards danger... almost embracing it. Can we trust them in such a critical situation?\"\n\nContrasting this, Pallaxia, a cloud-like sentience from the nebulous realm of Ethereal Mists, offered a differing viewpoint. \"Their fearlessness may be a valuable asset against the Vorlaxath Hive. Do we not value courage in the face of danger? Moreover, our laws are clear; we cannot deny them the opportunity to defend their place in the Orthonex.\"\n\n\"Their war technology is not to be overlooked,\" murmured Vesto, a telepathic mollusk-like creature from the ocean world of Tydalus, his thoughts pulsating through the council members. \"The humans seem particularly adept at it.\"\n\nThe debate raged on, with points made in favor and against the involvement of humans. Ultimately, Jogon\"s cautionary tales of human recklessness fell on respectful but unwavering minds. In the spirit of equality and a fair chance, the council decided to extend the call-to-arms to humanity.\n\nAn official communique was drafted, a formal request outlining the dire situation and pleading for any military assistance the humans could provide against the Vorlaxath Hive. The document was heavily reviewed, ensuring it was appropriately translated and devoid of any potential miscommunication.\n\nAs the communique was dispatched to the humans, Jogon, despite his initial reservations, felt a strange curiosity. Humans were wildly unpredictable, and if their historical data was any indicator, their response to the call-to-arms would be anything but conventional. Even as the council adjourned, one sentiment echoed through the hall: Only time would tell whether they had made a strategic ally or invited further chaos into their well-structured universe.\n\nA solar cycle passed before a response was received from the humans. The Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations, with its various species nervously watching, readied its armada against the approaching Vorlaxath Hive. News of the human response reached Jogon\"s desk, a mere line of text that belied the monumental nature of its message. The humans had dispatched a single ship in response to the call-to-arms. A single ship? Jogon felt his mandibles tense as he considered the implications.\n\nAs the overseers gathered once more to discuss this development, the massive view screen at the council chamber\"s front displayed the human ship in question. Compared to the sprawling, intricate structures of the Orthonex fleet, the human vessel looked like a tiny speck of metallic dust. There was an air of incredulity amongst the council. Pallaxia was the first to break the silence, \"Have the humans misunderstood our request?\"\n\nVesto, on the other hand, was more thoughtful. \"We should not underestimate them. Their technology advances at an unprecedented rate. They might surprise us yet.\"\n\nA collective sense of anticipation filled the room as the human vessel made its appearance at the meeting coordinates. But something was off. I took a moment before anyone had even noticed their arrival and according to the calculations, the humans should have taken a couple more days to reach the location given their FTL technology. The Overseers exchanged puzzled glances. How did they get here so quickly and without anyone noticing?\n\nOne of the senior federation officers, Gavroche, from the highly advanced civilization of Luminary and debatably the most advanced civilization in FTL travel, expressed his disbelief, \"It\"s almost as if they...teleported. But that\"s impossible.\" The humans were known to push the limits of technology, but instantaneous space travel was a frontier not even the most advanced civilizations in the Orthonex had crossed.\n\nAs the overseers grappled with this mystery, a communication request came through from the human ship. The council fell silent as the message was broadcasted. \"We apologize for the delay,\" a human voice echoed in the council chamber, their tone surprisingly casual, \"According to the rules we\"re still customizing ourselves to, our presence is required on the battlefield. Otherwise, we would have just teleported the bomb.\"\n\nJogon felt his multi-faceted eyes widen, his antennae twitching anxiously. \"Teleported the...bomb?\" The council echoed, confusion and dread filling the room as the full implications of the human\"s words hung in the air, a harbinger of a storm yet to come. In the following moments, time seemed to stretch and dilate, as though the universe itself was holding its breath.\n\nThe silence in the grand hall of the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations was so profound that one could almost hear the pulsations of the distant stars.\"Yes,\" the human voice broke the silence once more, its tone starkly contrasting with the tension that had encapsulated the hall. \"Our antimatter singularity bomb.\"Before the stunned council members could react, a blinding light blossomed on the massive viewscreen.\n\nAs they shielded their visual sensors from the radiant explosion, every conversation, every thought was dwarfed by the spectacle unfolding before them. The display struggled to compensate for the intense light before finally settling down to show the aftermath. And then, as the light receded, there was... nothing.\n\nJust the emptiness of space where once a horde of Vorlaxath Hive ships had swarmed. In what seemed to be an instant, the dire threat to the Orthonex was obliterated, reduced to cosmic dust.The human ship was also gone, leaving no trace behind. No heat signature, no warp trail, just a void where it had once hovered. \"Did they... Did they teleport away?\" murmured a stunned Gavroche, disbelief audible in his voice.\n\n\"There was no engine engagement, no displacement. It\"s as though they just... vanished.\"The council was left staring at the emptiness of space, their thoughts echoing Gavroche\"s disbelief. The magnitude of what the humans had just demonstrated was difficult to grasp. They had not only displayed the capability to annihilate a vast fleet with a single bomb but also hinted at a form of travel that seemed to defy the known laws of physics.\n\nJogon felt a chill running down his exoskeleton, his antennae twitching in the charged atmosphere of the council chamber. His earlier reports about human recklessness and unpredictability suddenly seemed like a grave understatement.As shockwaves of realization swept through the Conglomeration, one question resonated across the galactic federation, a question that carried with it an undercurrent of fear and awe, \"What exactly have we welcomed into our galactic community?\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The aftermath of the human intervention reverberated through the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations like a shockwave. In the cycles that followed, Jogon found himself at the center of a storm of inquiries, debates, and diplomatic maneuvering. His earlier cautions about human unpredictability now seemed prophetic, though not in the way he had anticipated.\n\nThe Overseers convened in emergency sessions, grappling with the implications of humanity's display of power. Some, like Councillor Dremik, advocated for immediate restrictions on human involvement in galactic affairs. \"We cannot allow such volatile beings unrestricted access to our civilizations,\" he argued, his silicon form vibrating with concern.\n\nOthers, like Pallaxia, saw opportunity in the chaos. \"Their technology could revolutionize our defenses,\" she countered, her misty form swirling with excitement. \"We must learn from them, not alienate them.\"\n\nAmidst the debates, Jogon was tasked with a new mission: to establish a deeper understanding of humanity and their capabilities. He found himself poring over historical records, analyzing cultural artifacts, and even attempting to decipher human entertainment media.\n\nAs he delved deeper into human history, Jogon began to see patterns emerge. Humanity's penchant for both destruction and creation, their ability to unite in the face of external threats while simultaneously engaging in internal conflicts, their rapid technological advancements often outpacing their ethical considerations – all of these painted a picture of a species that was as fascinating as it was terrifying.\n\nMeanwhile, diplomatic channels between the Conglomeration and Earth buzzed with activity. The humans, seemingly oblivious to the turmoil they had caused, expressed enthusiasm about further cooperation. They offered to share some of their technological advancements, a gesture that was met with both excitement and trepidation.\n\nJogon found himself in the position of advising the Overseers on how to proceed. \"We must approach this with caution,\" he stressed during one particularly tense meeting. \"The humans have shown themselves to be powerful allies, but we must also consider the potential risks of their unpredictable nature.\"\n\nAs the cycles passed, a tentative partnership began to form. Human scientists were invited to collaborate with Orthonex researchers, under strict supervision. The exchange of knowledge led to breakthroughs in various fields, from medicine to energy production. However, certain areas remained off-limits, particularly those related to weapons technology and instantaneous travel.\n\nJogon observed these developments with a mixture of fascination and apprehension. He couldn't shake the feeling that they were dealing with a force they didn't fully understand. His reports to the Overseers became more nuanced, acknowledging both the benefits and the potential dangers of closer ties with humanity.\n\nOne solar cycle, as Jogon sat in his office reviewing the latest data on human-Orthonex collaborations, he received an unexpected visitor. A human diplomat, Dr. Elara Chen, had requested a meeting with him.\n\nAs she entered his office, Jogon was struck by how small and fragile she appeared, a stark contrast to the power her species had demonstrated. Dr. Chen smiled, a gesture Jogon had learned to recognize as friendly. \"I've read your reports on humanity, Jogon,\" she began, her voice translated smoothly by the universal translator. \"I must say, your insights are quite remarkable.\"\n\nJogon's mandibles clicked in surprise. \"You've read my reports? I was under the impression they were classified.\"\n\nDr. Chen's smile widened. \"Let's just say that information has a way of flowing freely, especially when dealing with a species as curious as ours.\"\n\nAs they engaged in conversation, Jogon found himself reassessing his understanding of humans once again. Dr. Chen's intelligence, empathy, and genuine desire for mutual understanding shone through. Yet, her casual admission of accessing classified information reminded him of the unpredictable nature of her species.\n\nAs she was leaving, Dr. Chen turned to Jogon with a twinkle in her eye. \"You know, Jogon, you're right to be cautious about us. We're not always sure what we're capable of ourselves. But that's what makes life interesting, don't you think?\"\n\nWatching her leave, Jogon felt a mix of emotions he couldn't quite name. The humans were indeed a paradox – capable of great destruction and great creation, of recklessness and profound wisdom. As he turned back to his console, he realized that his job of understanding and advising on humanity was far from over.

{"id": "text_completion_016", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: # The Funeral\n\n\nThe dry eaves blew along the autumn wind\n\nSinging the ocean's song to the ears in the land locked hollow.\n\nThe tops of the hills shaded the lane occasionally giving way to glimpses of a sunset as the funeral procession poured toward the family plot nestled in the back of the homestead between two limestone cliffs.\n\nDuke was waiting with his fathers casket. The preacher stood, casting a shadow over the 6 foot hole that would soon hold the memories of the old man's bones. The preacher's wife stood by duke knowing that words could not penetrate the spell of grief that silenced the young man. Nor could her own losses teach her anything about his future.\n\nDuke stood. Though his eyes were gazing down the lane, he was nowhere to be found in them.\n\nIn the blackness of his mind stood a rocky bluff, beaten by waves\n\n\"We're free, but we're in hell,\" whispered a thought.\n\nThe procession gathered in the borrowed church chairs. The indiscrete tones filled the hollow as each person clung to the edges of their mind. Not wanting to consider the haunting vision of their future. The loss was enough, though nobody knew the deceases past his steadfast oars through which he steered the generational family, donations to the church, and sparse involvement in town events. Time was this man's god, and other people were it's cost.\n\nNext to the open grave lay Duke's mother. Her headstone was clean and polished like the love that she brought Duke's heart. She was seen and known for her sacrifices to her husband and to her hands. The world had swallowed her 3 years prior. Decades too early for Duke.\n\nDuke took his seat and the preacher's wife next to him. The preacher stood with his head bowed over the casket mumbling to himself while he slowly turned to face the congregation.\n\n\"Today we honor a man\n\nWho lived his life to the letter of the law, who gave his blood to his farm, his friends, and his kin. He walked among us like an omen\n\nHe stood Collected, Kind and Disciplined.\n\nA teacher in the spirit of nature\"\n\nThe preacher opened his bible to the gospel of John and spoke a sermon about light and the old man's life. He spoke about the passage of death. That it was indefinite and celebratory. That it was indeed both an end and a beginning.\n\nThe preacher did not care for any of his words. He had stopped caring years before when the world started to change and the mirror that greeted him every morning stopped staring so kindly. His words had no answers in them anymore. They were merely shorelines for his people and he was the one tasked with saying them.\n\nEverybody was there for Duke, not for his father whose mountainous behavior left him isolated. The old man was a remnant of a fire that was dying out taking with it the emptiness of living for oneself.\n\nThe preacher's words came to a close. The sun was setting behind a cloud shrouding the grove in dark blue shadows. Duke stood from his chair and shook the preachers hand, thanking him in a rasped panicked voice. He touched the casket and placed his father's hat on it.\n\nNot knowing what to do next, he awkwardly turned around and eyed the preacher and his wife.\n\nTurning his back, he knocked on the casket and whispered\n\n\"Bye dad\"\n\nFalling out of him like a breath.\n\nHe could hear the preacher's wife directing the seated audience- a reception at the house. Duke could feel hands patting his back in comfort and murmurs of condolences. Filling in the space around him. Squeezing his chest.\n\nThe eruption of people broke the levee that Duke had created, forcing him to look up.\n\n\"I need you all to go on ahead,\" bellowing as his knees shook but he wouldn't budge. Just pressed his hands harder and harder onto the casket,\n\n\"Back to the house ya'll, I'll meet you there.\"\n\nThe preacher and his wife began corralling the procession toward the lane, as the townsfolk retrieved their chairs and loaded them into the pickup truck.\n\nThe preacher's sons had been standing at the edge of the clearing leaning on their shovels, next to the pickup truck that had brought the casket out. They stood like crows, above it and unindoctrinated in grief. Only waiting for their father's voice to command them to the task of lowering and burying Duke's father.\n\nDuke could feel a heat rapture his face as he fought back tears and a place somewhere in his lungs began to tremor begging for breath. The air was a cool liquid that he felt behind his chest and this breath had carried every other breath in his lungs. His face was enveloped in heat as his salt stung his eyes. He wiped them as he turned - nodding toward the waiting preacher and walked toward the shovel to bury his father.\n\n# The Drought\n\nThere was no rain that summer but Duke's farm had remained operational. The local reservoir had not completely run dry but it would not last as there had been many summers like this over the preceding decades. Pressed, the local farmers traded in their families heirloom properties for mansions, allowing the chain of progress to fill in behind them. What had once been thousands of acres of orchards, golden fields of wheat and corn, waves of furrows of green alfalfa, lay giant boxes placed end to end – homes for everybody from the nearby city and for all people pulled by the gravity of lower real estate costs and new lives in this suburb.\n\nThe county was becoming *that* despite the proximity to the largest city nearby being more than an hours drive. Though this once village had no association to that city, it was becoming a pre-fix to be never spoken of in its own history.\n\nDuke knew this. His father had begun witnessing it before his death several years prior. They had watched as nearby communities became absorbed by the looming monolith to industry. There were new stores and new people. The dusty shadows that had camouflaged the townsfolk had become tapestried with new shades of colors each more vibrant than the last.\n\nThe old timers hated this emergence. They would hold court at local diners and glare at every visitor that would pass through their doors.\n\nStandoffish men became bitter\n\nBitter men became silent.\n\nDuke was not among either – though his father had become the silent type. Duke had no reason for lament- the community was changing in proportion to his curiosity. At times, he thought it was his young age, but he was not much younger than most bitter ranchers left. This farm had been the anchor of his family's heart for 4 generations. The trees and rocks had become the song that his life breathed through. The farm was the only hearth that he had known. Playing in it as a respite, then ultimately knowing it as his own personal clock.\n\nThis year, the ground was dustier and dying. He pulled only 3 out of 5 cuttings. 1 less then the year prior. There would be no profit this year. The few cattle that he ran could not diminish like his crops but no profit meant no feed and seed. No feed and seed meant that his farm might take the inevitable passage that had pulled his cohorts.\n\n-----\n\nThe August sun bore down on Duke's shoulders as he walked the lane to the family cemetery. The leaves from the bordering trees gave his skin intermittent relief and a quiet breeze dried his sweat. The cottonwoods swallowed Duke's eyes and the old knots and hallowed trunks warmed his chest with the feeling that a part of him was cocooned in their bark.\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket for the handkerchief to wipe his brow. He arrived at the family plot to see first his fathers grave, covered in grass and prairie flower. Adjacent his mothers tombstone lay prominently marking his loss 6 years prior. They were both from this county, though his mother was an only child and her family's line had come to a close with her. He never imagined their bodies to mingle in decay. They were separate and distinct from each other in their marriage and would be apart even through death, until the earth claimed their coffins too.\n\nThere were 4 generations of men, women, and some children in this cemetery. The bones of Duke's family stretched across the historical divide from homesteader to rancher. Though parcels had been sold off over the century, this land had seen the Great Depression and the advent of million dollar tractors. Duke wasn't sentimental but the farm was the only thing he knew. The cold cement echoed against his face as his cheeks tingled underneath his beard.\n\n\"Dad, I don't know if this land is gunna make it. The water's gone, the sun's got hotter, the feed's doubled in price and there's no sign of it lettin' up. I know you said stick with it. That this farm is bigger than me or you. But I think God's got other plans. Buck next door is selling. He's got a nice price for it. Nothing like the offers that you got. The dirt's dust. I don't see it getting wetter. I don't feel the end.\n\nI know what your gunna say, 'don't let the city get you. Don't be swallowed by the swarm.\n\nBut you know, it's only a matter of time with no rain.\n\nMomma, I know you never much cared for this place. I know you'd itch to leave as soon as a door opened.\"\n\nThe sun was soft but still warm. The clouds were dispersing in the distance and the grove held nothing but silence. Duke could hear his own searching. He felt embarrassed that he even had to ask. Duke felt like he was performing. Somehow he believed that he was supposed to already know the answer. Already know how to navigate this changing tide. He knew there was no one there to answer and the emptiness that his words fell against made him feel like a fool.\n\nWith frustration, he turned around and started marching his way back to the house. What answers had his father? He was dead. What good were his bones but a memory of his forms inevitable end? The hubris of his father to think that he could out last the great machine. His own hubris for even considering that he was an exception to the rule.\n\nCapable of selling or not, this land had shaped him and his very mind. He did not know himself apart from it. Every fiber of his being resisted the claim to be separate from the land. To be an individual pressing into the monolithic new age and bouncing off the new curiosities that modern industry had to offer. Duke knew that he was at a threshold and there was no exit that his heart could conjure to depart from his ever growing anguish – there was only suffocation.\n\nThe sun was beginning to set as Duke made it to the porch steps. There was nothing waiting for him inside except a few beers and a roast he cooked the night before. Wandering around his yard, he picked up the loose pieces of trash that had blown in from other parts of the property. Bringing the refuse to his garbage can, he went inside knowing there was no way to ease his consternation. There was no way out of his binding blade.\n\n# The Echo\n\nDuke drained the rocks of their energy. The land no longer harnessed the power of the soul. The fields became barren and void. The cows mingled slower to the troughs and the limits of Duke's hopes shown unearthed. The trees lived like they always had, bordering the homestead. The green that used to illuminate the center of the farm transformed itself into a papyrus brown as life from that spring that had fed the land so generously emptied without replenishment – the rocks drying out.\n\nLight pressed through the blinds into Dukes room. The pools of dust whirled in the rays of sunlight at the foot of his bed. Duke stared, absorbed in its clou,d watching the space between the dust. Watching currents move while the light remained stationary. He was already late to feed the cattle, but they had become accustomed to a daylit breakfast, adjusting for their caretakers evening habits.\n\nStaggering out of bed he found his irrigation boots and made his way to the barn to load his ATV with hay. The hungry herd was waiting, singing to each other in their semicircle. Duke broke apart the bale and splayed the flakes for the beasts. His head was booming and swirling as his stomach felt like it was sucked into his spine. His hands were tremoring as he took off his gloves – he reminded himself that he only needed to keep them alive until the next season. Grabbing the truck keys, he trudged to the drive-way and hopped into his silver truck.\n\nNobody was on the road this Sunday morning. They were either in church or away- looking to rediscover their foothold in nature. Nobody was there to witness Duke wrestle with the strongest motivation to pull his car into each passing power pole, every ditch, every large boulder. It would take nothing but a swift jerk of the wheel to the left or the right, to find a home in the immediate compression as his truck flung him to his timely death. He had watched it happen over and over in his head. This was his landscape to his journey townward. This was the road that Duke feared every time he stepped into that truck since his father's passing. He could feel the water in him asking for a way out but every day he kept driving, his hands becoming tighter and tighter against the steering wheel as the weeks turned into months, his hands becoming tighter as his negotiation set deeper into his jaw, then into his chest, then to his lungs where a small pocket of air carried the rest of him.\n\nDuke passed the city limits sign slowing his resolve while he anticipated the path to his gas station. The lot was empty but for the owner's car. He parked his truck and walked in through the glass door; nodding at the man behind the counter reading his newspaper. These two needed no words, the owner had known Duke since he had purchased the timeless store. Duke grabbed his 12 pack from the cooler, a sandwich from the heater, a pack of gum, cup of coffee, and walked up to the register.\n\n\"Now you know its dry today, I tell you every Sunday. The law don't let me sell on Sundays. You want your beer, drive the 20 minutes to the next county\"\n\nDuke stood blankly, though the sleep was out of his eyes, he still felt the weight of it holding down his eyelids.\n\n\"You know days don't work like that out here\"\n\nThe shopkeeper said nothing\n\nDuke shrugged\n\nPutting the daily provisions down he walked up to the register. He tossed his sandwich on the counter. I'll take 50 on pump 2\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded\n\n\"You want your tickets?\"\n\nDuke Shook his head\n\nHe walked out making his way to the bed of his truck. Sitting and drinking his morning cup while his tank fueled.\n\nA green crossover rolled into the station's parking lot filled with a family. 2 little brown boys, a girl, and their parents. Duke eyed them inquisitively – there had been new people coming into town for the last couple of decades but this family pulled his attention. Their presence forced air down his chest and a small tremor sang from a space behind his ribs. Duke could feel his bones for the first time since his father died. They quivered and ached against the bed of his truck.\n\nHe watched as the family filed out of the car- the father exhausted but smiling, the mother resting in her own enchantment, like she had won herself over. The children reminded him of his school days. One was quietly watching while the other two played a slapping game as the family swirled into the gas station. The parents waved and Duke returned the gesture with barely enough time for them to see before they approached the door.\n\nDuke's tank finished fueling\n\nHe took a sip of coffee and slipped off the back of his truck.\n\n------\n\nHe drove homeward meandering from back road to back road, not knowing who was driving. He found the road to the highway that led south to the nearest county. In the years preceding, there were no events that marked his days nor an inner will to admit that he had lost contact with his sense of time. The highway took him 10 minutes to the adjacent county that wasn't dry on Sundays. Pulling into the first gas station, he sat in the moment between the truck halting and the release of his key in the ignition – his lips pursed and his fingers tapping the steering wheel. Traffic had picked up picked up carrying church goes home creating a wall of noise. Duke was met with a lull in the flow revealing the sounds of shifting metal creak in his ears while his truck settled.\n\nA glint in his eye and a glimmer of a sneer marked his descent from the truck. Duke marched through the gas station door. Entranced as he opened the door, he made his way to the gas cans on the bottom shelf. Grabbing 4, he waltzed to the counter.\n\n# The Passage\n\n*Bottled Tempests*\n\n*Scorching the summers weave*\n\n*Ashes to Ashes*\n\n*Dust to Dust*\n\nDukes blood pulsed with each step. With each step his face became tighter and tighter. He shut the curtains in his parents bedroom, preserved as it had been since nobody slept there these days. The dust didn't bother him, but this day he could see just how much had gathered on the linens. His boots echoed across the wood floors as he went from window to window, yanking the cloth shut. Grabbing one of the gas cans, he flung the petrol across the mattress that his parents had rested their limbs on for decades.\n\nHe tipped the container over at the doorway and watched the puddle spread between the floor boards. Duke barreled to the guest room and did the same thing. He spied the pictures on the wall that were a testament to his mother's interior decorating. Taking them off the wall and tossing them on the floor he emptied the second container over the glass and wood.\n\nHe trudged to his room and flipped his bed over . The mattress slammed into the window sending shards of glass to the backyard, 2 stories below. He cleared the clothes out of the closet and dumped them on the bed. Dukes hands started to shake as he emptied the third container. The fumes burned the inside of his nose.\n\nThe smell was not transitive, it neither carried him to any memory nor even attracted his attention at all. In truth, Duke was intoxicated by the fumes and drank them in, feeling the touch and timbre in his throat.\n\nHe finished dousing the third room and set out to finish the rest of the house. At this point the bottoms of his boots were wet and the floor had become slick. He leaped down the stairs with the fourth and last container of fuel. Drenching the front room of his family's farmhouse. The shadows from the already closed curtains danced around the center of the room. His home was unrecognizable. The couches that he had slept on sat motionless and stale. There was no one there. There was nothing left living in that old home.\n\nDuke took the final container and removed the cap. He timidly made his way to the front door that he had entered and exited thousands of times. His boots getting wetter and wetter. The door warred with him. His eyes became absorbed in the seams of the wood. The knots and rings pulling him into them. The brass hinges, made by his great grandfather, reflected the sepia light in the room. He felt his face getting tighter and tighter and pressure in his lips became unbearable as he reached forward.\n\n-----\n\nThe door flew open as he fell to his feet\n\nThe earth took his wound and he gave it his life.\n\nHe walked onto the dirt in front of him\n\nLetting the light fall on his face and the air became pregnant fire.\n\nThe earth bore it and moved him to his car\n\nHe stepped into the cab and drove away.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "# The Aftermath\n\nDuke's truck rumbled down the dusty road, leaving behind a plume of smoke rising from the farmhouse. His knuckles were white against the steering wheel, his jaw clenched tight. The rearview mirror reflected the orange glow of flames consuming generations of memories.\n\nHe drove aimlessly, his mind a whirlwind of emotions. The weight of his actions pressed heavily upon him, yet a strange sense of liberation coursed through his veins. The farm had been both his anchor and his prison, and now he had severed that tie in the most permanent way possible.\n\nAs the adrenaline began to ebb, reality started to seep in. Duke pulled over to the side of the road, his hands trembling as he cut the engine. The silence was deafening, broken only by the sound of his ragged breathing.\n\n\"What have I done?\" he whispered, his voice cracking.\n\nThe enormity of his actions crashed over him like a tidal wave. He had destroyed not just a house, but a legacy. The home that had sheltered his family for generations, the walls that held whispers of laughter and tears, all reduced to ash by his own hand.\n\nDuke's mind raced back to the family he had seen at the gas station earlier that day. Their hope, their unity, their future – everything he felt he had lost. In a moment of desperation, he had tried to burn away his pain, but now he realized he had only compounded it.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the barren landscape, Duke made a decision. He couldn't run from this. He started the truck and turned back towards town, towards the life he had tried to erase.\n\nThe local sheriff's office was quiet when Duke walked in, his boots leaving traces of ash on the worn linoleum floor. Deputy Sarah looked up, her eyes widening as she took in his disheveled appearance and the smell of smoke clinging to his clothes.\n\n\"Duke? What's happened?\" she asked, rising from her desk.\n\nDuke's voice was barely above a whisper. \"I burned it down, Sarah. I burned it all down.\"\n\nThe next few hours passed in a blur of questions, statements, and phone calls. Duke sat in a daze, answering mechanically when prompted. The reality of his situation began to sink in – he was now homeless, possibly facing arson charges, and had destroyed not just his own property but a piece of the town's history.\n\nAs dawn broke, Duke found himself sitting on a bench outside the sheriff's office. The town was starting to wake up, and news of the fire had spread quickly. He could feel the weight of stares and whispers as people passed by.\n\nUnexpectedly, a figure sat down beside him. It was Pastor Jim, the man who had presided over his father's funeral.\n\n\"Duke,\" the pastor said softly, \"I heard what happened.\"\n\nDuke couldn't bring himself to meet the older man's eyes. \"I don't know why I did it,\" he mumbled.\n\nPastor Jim was quiet for a moment before speaking. \"Sometimes, Duke, we're so consumed by our pain that we lash out, trying to make the world feel what we feel inside. But destruction doesn't heal us. It just leaves us with more emptiness.\"\n\nDuke felt tears prickling at the corners of his eyes. \"What do I do now?\" he asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nThe pastor placed a gentle hand on Duke's shoulder. \"You rebuild, son. Not just the house, but yourself. This doesn't have to be the end of your story. It can be a new beginning.\"\n\nFor the first time in what felt like years, Duke felt a glimmer of hope. The road ahead would be long and difficult, but he wasn't alone. The community he had tried to push away was rallying around him, offering support and understanding.\n\nAs the sun climbed higher in the sky, Duke stood up.

{"id": "text_completion_017", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: I have a ghost.\n\n\nIn my house. I think.\n\nMy husband.\n\nI think.\n\nI'm tapping loudly on my computer. I do everything loudly now. I bang open cabinets, slam drawers, pound my fuzzy slippers heavily on the ground. To let the ghost know I'm here. To warn him of my presence. Because it's when I'm sneaking… that he finds me.\n\nThis house aches. I ache - that kind of … rich people ache. A clean, hollow, Hitchcockian ache. A whistling ache. The wind rips right through you. I know because I've been both. A poor person's ache feels damp. Heavy. Waterlogged. The wind can't rip it. Nothing can.\n\nI inherited this house. And ghosts aren't the only things I've inherited with it. Brown widows (me?). Brown recluses (also me). Spindly creepy crawly heat-seeking things, determined to share my life. To take refuge from the doldrums of our island's winter tantrums. I've been alone here for a year and a half, but still, every time I flip on a light switch to reveal a fat centipede skitter under my bed, or a gilt edged silver fish looking up at me from the clawfoot tub - hot terror catches me.\n\nAll creatures I somehow never remember seeing while my husband was alive. Sometimes I wonder if the house is really mine, or if it was always theirs. With the ringing absence of my late husband's stewardship, it is changing hands, being returned back to the land. And the original owners are finding their way in through the cracks. Foundations loosening. Spirits and bugs welcome.\n\nLooking at me, you wouldn't think I'm the type to be haunted by the ghost of a husband who can't move on. And yet, I fear, that is exactly what is happening.\n\nIt's a little flattering, really. At 38, I've kept up pretty good. Mainly, my hair. It's a little brassy from decades of blonde bottle dye, the ends crispy and straw-like, but I have not yet succumbed to that short haircut women fall victim to at my age. The haircut of a woman disappearing. A certain time of year I sport a rich, golden tan. But a lifetime of beach bumming with no sunscreen has taken its toll. My face dotted with faint patches and lines, settlers upon this land, seizing it and claiming it as their own. I've got the skinny legs of a teenager. Of a sand piper's, nearly invisible, scurrying away from the crash of the shore. But my top half resembles that of a dumpling. Storing all my softness at my center, with heaving breasts like overripe fruit. My thinness radiating out, trying its best to stretch away, to defy the pull of a centrifugal dough ball force. I have small brown eyes. Almond shaped and light, like watery coffee with shiny hazel flecks. Big full lips, and a flat ass. A few tattoos. From over the years. Maybe a few more than I'd like. But, they prove good conversation starters anyway. I'm regular white, but don't always look it, no one knows why. A Portuguese grandad on my mom's side, I've heard? But like most family lore… probably meaningless.\n\nI pad my way down the spiral staircase that dizzyingly dumps me at the door.\n\n\"Coming down!\" I elongate the syllables like I'm trying them out for the first time.\n\n—\n\nMarch on the coast is unnerving.\n\nBlock Island has abandonment issues.\n\nShe shivers and creaks and forces you to love her. Once the tourists and second-homers pack up at the end of summer, she gives her chosen ones sixty days of pure pleasure, reigniting their shaken faith. Devilishly drawing them in, captivating them … until they become captive. Blinded by her piercing beauty, her golden September afternoons, her sweet loganberry harvest, the best of her treasures saved for the most loyal. Her October plenty. Her blazing red leaves and edible purple skies. Her bright salty mornings and crab boil nights. She wraps you in her arms so tight that come November - you can't breathe. You're being - choked. Her thrashing waters, a bride in hysterics. She cries \"Why does everyone leave me?\" \"Why can't they stay when I need them most?\" The storm of her petulance tiring even herself out. Then, her loneliness turns punishing. \"I love you, don't leave me\". \"Prove that you love me. Prove you won't ever leave. If you truly love me, take my choppy seas and caustic winds. Take my blistering freeze, my cavernous hallows. Can you take it? My shrouded mourning gown, my grey forever.\"\n\nSo we do. Until summer, when growing fat off the adoration of mere strangers, she turns her sun gaze away from the ones who steadied her in her bleak fit of winter. Bitterly, we blame the trampling tourist - you know the kind, throwing his money around and leaving. But deep down, every New Shoreham resident understands, if we sit still within ourselves, our ire is misplaced. That our woman chose someone else to shine on. We are back in competition with the handsome drifter.\n\nSo, March. March on the island is as sapless as it is serpentine. As dull as it is aching. Call it cabin fever. Call it winter blues. Call it anything other than what it is. A desire to leave.\n\n—\n\nMy marriage to Jordan was fine. Really! We loved each other in a way that is truly underrated: A love balanced on the scales of \"You don't acknowledge my flaws, and I won't acknowledge yours.\" We supported each other and stayed out of each others way. The sort of love that has fallen out of fashion now. The kind where I didn't work and I was fine with that. The kind where you both get what you asked for, then realize you both asked for the wrong thing, but you stick with it anyway. The kind where we never wanted kids because we never wanted to rouse such strong feelings. Even for each other. We did have a dog named Chester. And we loved him a medium amount. So it's… strange that… now that Jordan's dead… he wants me so bad.\n\nI swipe my keys off the hook and zip my coat. A big puffy one I found in the attic. Forest green with a khaki collar. I smooth balm from the pocket over my chapping lips. I feel like he's watching me. Even now.\n\n\"I'm going out\" I yell, into the stagnant air.\n\n—\n\nThe door chimes as I slink from the pitiless, ashen afternoon into the dark bar. Warm and humming - the belly of the whale. I sidle up and in the mirror, catch myself flipping my hair to one side and over my shoulder with wanton flair.\n\nI had been a waitress all my life. Well, my previous life. My pre-Jordan life. Since I was 14, I worked the Rhode Inn every summer, wearing white t-shirts that read \"Rhode Hard and Put Away Wet\". That's where we met, actually. He was a city boy. Boston. Invested some capital in a few of our local dives along the coast. Degree in Finance, the whole bit. Did a good job, really. Not overbearing, not trying to \"class it up\", corporatize us. They were popular little joints, so he wasn't trying to fix what wasn't broke.\n\n\"Want some oysters, Kat? Boat just came in.\" Trish stood comfortably, some rags in hand, her red hair gelled back into one severe ponytail.\n\n\"Nah, I'm OK.\"\n\n\"Ky's out back.\" She says, her back to me.\n\nHer knees crack as she squats down, pulling sharpie-dated quart containers of soupy, red cocktail sauce out of a low boy. I try to sound casual, like I'm not quite sure why she'd be telling me where Ky is.\n\n\"Oh. OK.\"\n\nKy was my weakness. Is now, and always will be forever, amen. The broad, thick chest of a working man. Sea grey eyes, and the touch of someone whose presence is so crushing he had to learn, the hard way, how to handle the delicate things he loomed over. Hapless and unpolished, but careful. A hearty grin when he'd give it.\n\nI fidget with my wallet while Trish slides me a Sam Adams.\n\n\"Put that away!\" she scolds.\n\n\"Thanks.\" I smile sheepishly.\n\nI put a coaster over my beer after the first sip and fish a pack of cigarettes out of my pocket.\n\n—\n\nBehind the restaurant, I hover. My plan is to wait for him to say something first. To happen upon me.\n\n\"Kat! Heads up!\"\n\nIt's Tony. My favorite pint-sized maniac, unloading ingredients from the back of a box truck with feverish irregularity. I look in the direction of his voice, and he lobs an industrial bag of sea salt at my head. I dodge it just in time. It puts out my cigarette.\n\n\"What the FUCK Tony!\" I yelp.\n\n\"You'll live!\" He responds brightly, as I fumble with my lighter.\n\n\"Havin' a drink?\" He asks, candy-coated in envy. He slaps one commercial kitchen sized vacuum sealed pork loin over each shoulder and hops off the truck, his knees buckling ever-so-slightly.\n\nI nod, taking a long drag.\n\n\"You can have that, by the way. It's expired.\" His \"i's\" wide and throaty, an old-school New England accent stuck around his tonsils.\n\n\"Whatdoyathink I'm gonna need a five pound bag of expired salt for?\"\n\n\"Your drive way!\" Tony yells forcefully, rolling his eyes.\n\n\"Always tryin' ta provide for the helpless widow…\" I jab back, with over-measured precision and pitch perfect volume, aimed just-so at the back of the truck. Hoping Ky can hear.\n\nJust then, Ky emerges, hauling clams, headed for the walk-in.\n\n\"I could think of something else to do with a helpless widow…\" He breathes, brushing my coat with his crooked elbow.\n\nThe air between us sharpens.\n\nAnd my unfortunate first thought is: Jordan.\n\nDammit. I might need this salt after all.\n\n—\n\nAmid the dregs of winter, having no job and a dead husband, I found I left the house less and less— which meant I rarely saw it from this angle. I pull into the driveway and idle, craning my neck up.\n\nIt's impressive. Built in 1888, it's a classic example of the Victorian style of architecture known as Queen Anne. Nantucket blue with white trim and cranberry stained accents. Three sweeping stories embraced by a wrap-around porch with turned posts, decorative brackets, and spindlework.\n\nIts asymmetrical facade gives it the character of a person. Multifaceted, tiresome. Showing some things off with a flourish of Dutch gables—and concealing others, the way we do. Its most prominent features on display like stories we tell over and over at parties. Its second-story balcony almost pouts with disuse, sagging slightly under a proud polygonal turret, dramatically built on a series of bay windows—a final, trumpeting declaration. \"I used to be someone, something\".\n\nNot sure Jordan's parents were too thrilled when he left the house solely to me. But they retained the Boston assets, washed me out of their Supper Club hair, and I got to stay. Here. At home. The island of my teenaged summers.\n\nAnd so did Jordan. Apparently.\n\n—\n\n\"I'm home!\" I bang and crash through the foyer. \"It's fucking freezing in here.\" I say aloud, the door slamming behind me.\n\nIt is then that I see it— four french doors helplessly thrashing against their frames in the wind. Cabinets in the kitchen all open. Whisks and muddlers violently askew on the floor. Umbrellas spilled from a shattered standing vase.\n\nThen a side-splitting howl, as an angry gust of sea wind whips through the naked, open channel that is now my house. Suddenly, I kneel to the ground and weep. I give up. Why is he doing this to me?\n\n—\n\nIt didn't make sense. One, he didn't die here. In the house. He died in a car accident. A little over a year ago. In Providence, on his way home from a lunch meeting. If people are going to haunt, they're usually going to do it at the *site* of their death. Stuck there. Unwilling to move on, but unable to exist outside a loop, playing out their death over and over, trying to get it right this time. I know because I've done my research. Had a psychic over in November. A local woman with soft white hair piled on her head, an excess of earrings, and virtually non-stop chatter about angels. She refused to step beyond the porch, claiming she felt she wasn't \"invited\" by the house, until I reminded her *I'm the one* \"inviting\" her to make that $100/hour she insisted on.\n\nSo. She tells me. If your loved one turns into a ghost, a haunting, a spirit caught between planes, it's either because:\n\n\n\n1. Their death was untimely\n2. Their death was horrifically violent.\n\nOK. Jordan was 49 when he died. So yes, too young. But not exceedingly young. Not \"he had his whole life ahead of him\" young. I mean, not two generations ago, that was a perfectly reasonable age to forever etch on a tombstone. His car accident, as tragic as it was, wasn't exceptionally horrific either. Just your average death. Pretty symbolic of a lot in Jordan's life.\n\nBut *even if* those two criteria were met, the psychic assured me that spirits of the departed are *still* likely to haunt the place they died in.\n\nBut he's not haunting a busy stretch of I-95… He's haunting me.\n\nHe died in me.\n\nSomehow.\n\n\"And one more thing\" she said. Stopping me, as her glasses fogged, one foot out the door, her pale eyes growing paler. \"It could be unfinished business. That's c.\" The ABCs of haunting.\n\nUnfinished business. The unfinished business of what exactly? I loved him—I want to make that one thing clear. I did love him. I smile when I think about his jet dark hair, perfect in that boxy, side-parted Republican way. His brooding countenance - the sort of etched severity that promises trouble below. Except with Jordan, there was no darkness. He had no demons. That was just how his face looked.\n\nI miss his big vocabulary, that phone voice he reserved for \"business calls\", the fake laugh he used on demanding restaurant patrons, or that easy way he fell asleep, every limb draped over mine.\n\nHe was never vindictive. Never looking for ways people could hurt him, the way I do. Sure, maybe… maybe we'd've been better off as friends, but we also *wanted* the same things: Comfort. This beach. Cold beer. This house. Using Chester-the-unruly-dog as an alibi to never visit his parents or sister. A medium sized boat.\n\nHe was never this passionate in life. He wasn't even particularly stubborn. Unfinished business felt so uncharacteristically romantic by comparison. My throat itches as I wonder if the unfinished business we had was in never loving each other recklessly. Totally. Always skating through life unannounced. Never asking ourselves \"Isn't it supposed to be more beautiful than this?\"\n\nNow, I sweep up the broken vase and put the kitchen back together. It's the best I can do.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2.

The house is eerily quiet, save for the persistent ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway. I reach for my phone on the nightstand, its blue light illuminating the darkness. 3:17 AM.\n\nAs I lay there, trying to calm my nerves, I hear it. A faint creaking sound coming from downstairs. My breath catches in my throat. Is it him? Jordan?\n\nI slip out of bed, my feet hitting the cold hardwood floor. I grab the baseball bat I've taken to keeping nearby and make my way down the spiral staircase, each step deliberate and silent.\n\nThe living room is bathed in moonlight, casting long shadows across the floor. Nothing seems out of place, but the air feels thick, charged with an unseen presence. I grip the bat tighter, my knuckles turning white.\n\n\"Jordan?\" I whisper, my voice barely audible. \"Is that you?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThen, a gust of wind rattles the windows, making me jump. I laugh nervously, chiding myself for being so paranoid. But as I turn to head back upstairs, I see it – a figure, translucent and shimmering, standing by the french doors.\n\nMy heart stops. It's him. Jordan. But not as I remember him. This version of my husband looks... desperate. Longing. His eyes, once warm and inviting, now burn with an intensity I've never seen before.\n\n\"Jordan,\" I breathe, the bat clattering to the floor. \"What do you want?\"\n\nHe opens his mouth to speak, but no sound comes out. Instead, he reaches out towards me, his spectral hand passing through my arm as I instinctively step back. The chill that runs through me is bone-deep, a mixture of fear and... something else. Longing? Regret?\n\nIn that moment, I understand. The unfinished business. It wasn't just his – it was ours. The passion we never allowed ourselves to feel, the depths of emotion we always skirted around. Now, in death, Jordan was consumed by it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I whisper, tears streaming down my face. \"I'm sorry we never...\"\n\nBut before I can finish, he's gone. The room feels suddenly empty, the air returning to normal. I'm left standing alone, my heart aching with a loss I never fully acknowledged until now.\n\nThe next morning, I wake up feeling different. Lighter, somehow. As if admitting the truth of our relationship – both its strengths and its shortcomings – has lifted a weight off my shoulders.\n\nI make my way downstairs, half-expecting to see the chaos from yesterday. But everything is in its place. No open cabinets, no scattered utensils. Even the vase I swept up last night is intact, standing proudly by the door.\n\nI pour myself a cup of coffee and step out onto the porch. The March air is crisp, carrying the promise of spring. For the first time in months, I feel a spark of something new. Hope, maybe?\n\nAs I sip my coffee, I make a decision. It's time to stop hiding. Time to face the world – and myself – head-on. I pull out my phone and dial a number I haven't called in years.\n\n\"Hey, Ky? It's Kat. I was wondering if you'd like to grab a drink sometime?\"\n\nAs I hang up, I swear I feel a warm breeze caress my cheek. Not the biting wind of winter, but something gentler. Approving, even. I smile, looking out at the ocean.\n\n\"Goodbye, Jordan,\" I whisper. \"Thank you.\"\n\nAnd for the first time since his death, I feel truly at peace.

{"id": "text_completion_018", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: It had been decided that the machine must go. I didn\"t find myself agreeing with Major Milic very much these days. His methods were harsh, brutal and he had become a fanatic. I\"d call him more of a terrorist than a freedom fighter. But he was right, the machine had to go. I didn\"t have any confidence we could do it, however.\n\n\nThe resistance had changed in the last couple years. The Emperor\"s personal secret project was brought online. Though it was round, it wasn\"t like it the \"Death Star.\" This Empire was real, and it made smarter decisions. It spent its time and money on a brain. CyCLOPS- Cybernetic, Control, Law-enforcement, and Online Policing System- changed the rules of human nature more and more every day. It make it possible for a few people to effectively watch the entire human populace at once. It watched, it learned, it analyzed, it predicted, and it remembered with perfect clarity all at a single time.\n\nI had been surprised at first when Major Milic rescued me from my prison, but not when I figured out what he planned to do. He needed me for two reasons. One- I could fly helicopters, the old ones without autopilot. Two- I knew where CyCLOPS was. And I suppose a third reason too; I would never turn him into the Imperial Union.\n\nI agreed to help, not that I had a lot of choice when everything I knew was lost and there was a gun in my face. I left the prison behind, but all the while knowing I would die with them instead.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCyCLOPS is not easy to get near. It was secret to begin with, but they knew better than to rely on that alone. Through torture, Major Milic\"s loyal team discovered a lot information about the facility. Though most work with it is done remotely, it has over 500 that work directly with the machine on-site. These are mostly fat technicians and overpaid civilians, not that Milic recognized civilians anymore. They wouldn\"t put up much of a fight when push came to shove.\n\nThe security came from a reinforced, mixed-guard company made up of Sentinels and Assault Forces. One company of three platoons. Each platoon covered a 12-hour shift. One was on days, one on nights, one on recovery cycle at all times. They had six guard towers with heavy machine guns on the walled perimeter. The walls were made of carbonized concrete, the gate was heavy metal and automatic, and there was electrified razor wire across the top. Four roving patrols covered the exterior of the facility, rejecting any trespassers onto the \"Navajo Sanctuary Reservation.\" At least one large armored vehicle was ready at all times for a quick reaction force. The rest of the on-shift platoon patrolled the inside of the compound and checked key points.\n\nIf at any point the guards caught wind of our approach and intentions, the other platoons would be woken and activated as reserves. An entire company of heavily armed and armored Sentinels would be vastly too much to deal with, and we\"d be slaughtered. We had to 1- approach undetected, 2- blind the guard towers so they could not shoot down our helicopters, 3- secure the barracks and take the reserves hostage before they could get to their arms room, 4- deal with the existing guards in the compound, 5- lock the gate to prevent the roving patrols from returning with more firepower, 6- break into and make our way into the facility, and at last, 7- blow CyCLOPS to high hell. None of the major processor banks can survive. No one knows the extent of its capabilities for certain, besides the Emperor and his chosen team, but it may likely begin to back up its data to external servers outside of the facility. The more we can destroy, the more we\"ve set back the Empire, and the more time we've bought for a larger resistance to mobilize.\n\nThey are dependent on the machine now. They will be weaker than they were before it\"s installation. But first, we had to get there. And I had a bad feeling. So many things could go wrong.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI listened as intently as I could to Milic\"s briefing. He\"d thought of everything. Even from his little bunker hidden away from the world, he\"d managed to gather a lot of intelligence. From his position at the top of the map, he could point out every section of the base, where we would land, where the satellite communications were, where the barracks and arms rooms were, where we would enter the facility, and more. I wasn\"t sure how he knew all of this. I think I didn\"t want to know.\n\n\"Sam, are you fuckin\" paying attention!?\" His eyes seemed to glow from the light reflected off the map in the otherwise dark bunker.\n\n\"What? Yes. I know where to land.\" Truthfully I\"d never been the same since that prison. I couldn\"t focus on anything too long.\n\n\"But after that?\"\n\n\"What... what am I doing after that? That wasn\"t... I didn\"t agree to-\"\n\n\"I don\"t give a shit. You\"re with me. I\"m not letting you out of my sight.\"\n\n\"Who\"s going to stay with the helicopter?\"\n\n\"Jacob will keep it running.\" He pointed to Powell, next to me. Anyone who knew him called him Powell. Only people who pretended to know him called him Jake or Jacob. They\"d had a long history, but that told me how close they weren\"t. Powell\"s eyes locked with mine for a moment then looked away. He was a hostage here, too. He was the man that taught me to fly. He was old now. So was I.\n\n\"I\"m not shooting anyone.\"\n\n\"That\"s fine. You\"ll help carry explosives. You\"ve got no problem blowing this thing up. That\"s what we agreed on, right?\"\n\n\"Okay... right. I\"m with you.\"\n\n\"You\"re attached to my hip. You go where I fuckin\" tell you and nowhere else. Is that understood?\"\n\n\"I\"m with you.\" I growled.\n\n\"3rd squad, alpha-team\"s goals are the communications array...\" he continued. But again, I already wasn\"t listening. A faint whining grew in my ears, and I faded out into one of my blackout spells. After coming all this way, and everything I\"ve worked for- everything I did to fight the Empire- it was probably Milic that was going to kill me.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDuring pre-flight checks with Powell, we talked a little bit. It was nice. I climbed up on top of the back of the bird to give the yoke a good look.\n\n\"This piece of shit is not gonna fly.\" I interjected, looked at the rust near the blade hub.\n\n\"It\"ll fly. I flew it yesterday.\"\n\n\"The rotors are going to fall off before we get there.\"\n\n\"No... but we\"re in for a bumpy ride. She definitely handles like a... heh heh, Sammy, you remember that old two-seater we flew up to that Appalachian relay station?\"\n\n\"Oh dear god, we almost died. On three separate occasions.\" I grinned.\n\n\"We\"ve been through tougher spots.\" Powell grinned too and climbed up the other side. His entire bald head wrinkled when he smiled.\n\n\"Yeah... but we were younger men. And the Empire didn\"t rule the world yet.\"\n\n\"Nothing lasts forever. Not youth, and not this crummy empire. They all fall down eventually. We\"re just giving it a good shove.\"\n\n\"You really think we\"re going to win?\" my grin faded. That old feeling returned.\n\n\"I think so. Major Milic\"s got his plan down tight. He\"s resourced everything he needs. We have our opening. You don\"t think we can?\"\n\nThe yoke, despite several conditions I would normally reject, appeared okay. The blades were in surprisingly good condition. It would fly all the way to the scene of the crash. \"I don\"t think so.\"\n\n\"You need to give the guy more credit. I know you don\"t agree with his methods, but he\"s a warrior. This is what he was built for. You have that prison mindset still. The walls are all closed in around you.\"\n\n\"Oh I don\"t think it\"s the prison that got to me,\" I looked out into the setting sun of the evening. The scenery from up here was incredible.\n\n\"Is this about Lindsey?\"\n\n\"No. Lindsey\"s gone. This is about us. Now. Though I admit, it\"s hard to forget her face with a bullet in it. I\"m glad she\"s not here to see this. This is going to be... a mess.\"\n\nPowell reached up and grabbed my hand and held it in both of his. \"You\"ve gotta have a little faith in this team. They know what they\"re doing.\"\n\n\"I know. But this team never met the Emperor. I\"ve met him, and... No one on earth knows what they\"re doing compared to him. He sees everything coming.\"\n\n\"Sam, you have to believe we can win.\"\n\n\"I know... there\"s a chance we can win. But we need to be ready. If it\"s not a trap now, it will be by the time we get there.\" The sun slipped from view, and we were left standing in the dark.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story:\n\nThe night air was cold and biting as we lifted off. The rotors whirred to life, drowning out the anxious chatter of Milic's men. Powell and I shared a knowing glance as we ascended into the darkness. The old bird groaned and shuddered, but she held steady.\n\nAs we approached the facility, my stomach knotted with dread. The perimeter lights pierced through the night, illuminating the imposing walls and guard towers. Everything looked exactly as intelligence had reported, which only heightened my suspicion.\n\n\"Two minutes to touchdown,\" I called out over the comms. Milic nodded, his face a mask of grim determination.\n\nWe touched down in a small clearing just beyond the facility's outer perimeter. As soon as the skids hit the ground, Milic's teams sprang into action. They moved with practiced efficiency, fanning out into the darkness.\n\n\"Remember,\" I whispered to Powell as I climbed out, \"if things go south—\"\n\n\"I know,\" he cut me off, his eyes conveying what words couldn't. \"Good luck, Sammy.\"\n\nI fell in line behind Milic, my arms laden with explosives. We crept through the underbrush, the facility looming before us. The first phase went smoothly—too smoothly. The guard towers were neutralized with precision, their occupants taken out by silenced sniper fire.\n\nAs we breached the perimeter, that familiar whine started building in my ears again. I shook my head, trying to clear it. We couldn't afford any slip-ups now.\n\nThe barracks fell next, Milic's men moving like ghosts through the compound. But as we approached the main facility housing CyCLOPS, something felt off. The security was lighter than expected, the resistance minimal.\n\n\"Major,\" I hissed, grabbing Milic's arm. \"This is too easy. It has to be a trap.\"\n\nHe shrugged me off, his eyes wild with fervor. \"We're too close to back out now. Plant those charges and let's finish this.\"\n\nAs we entered the heart of the facility, the whine in my ears crescendoed. The room housing CyCLOPS was vast, filled with banks of servers and pulsing with an eerie blue light. But it was empty—no technicians, no guards.\n\n\"Now!\" Milic barked, and his men began planting explosives with practiced speed.\n\nThat's when I saw it—a faint shimmer in the air, barely perceptible. \"Wait!\" I yelled, but it was too late.\n\nThe air around us seemed to solidify, and suddenly we were encased in some kind of energy field. Milic and his men fired their weapons uselessly, the bullets dissipating harmlessly against the barrier.\n\nA familiar voice echoed through the room, sending chills down my spine. \"Did you really think it would be that easy?\"\n\nThe Emperor materialized before us, his holographic form flickering slightly. His eyes found mine, a cruel smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"Ah, Sam. I knew you'd lead them here eventually. Your predictability has always been your weakness.\"\n\nMilic turned on me, his face contorted with rage. \"You betrayed us?\"\n\n\"No!\" I shouted, but the doubt in his eyes was clear.\n\nThe Emperor laughed. \"Oh, he didn't betray you consciously. But we've known about your little resistance for months. Sam here was our unwitting mole, broadcasting your every move through the neural implant we gave him in prison.\"\n\nThe realization hit me like a physical blow. The blackouts, the whining in my ears—it all made sense now.\n\n\"You see,\" the Emperor continued, \"CyCLOPS isn't just a surveillance system. It's an extension of human consciousness itself. And now, thanks to you, we have the location of every resistance cell on the planet.\"\n\nAs the implications of his words sank in, I felt the last vestiges of hope drain away. We hadn't just failed—we'd doomed everyone who'd ever opposed the Empire.\n\nThe room began to fill with gas, and as consciousness slipped away, I caught a final glimpse of Powell through the facility's windows. He was taking off in the helicopter, escaping into the night. At least someone had made it out.\n\nAs darkness claimed me, I clung to that small victory. Maybe, just maybe, there was still a chance for the resistance. But for now, our fight was over, and the Empire's grip on humanity had just become that much tighter.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_019", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: My name is Kristin Renee Saunders, and my life has become crazy in a big fucking way. And the shit part is I can't even tell anyone about it. Forget talking to my therapist, she'd have me locked up and the key thrown away if I attempted to unload any of my problems and experiences. After all, who would believe anyone who said they were involved in a murderous power-grab between witches, vampires, werewolves and other supernatural races?\n\n\nNot one damn person, that's who.\n\nBut if I don't get this off my chest, I might lock me up and throw away the key. If only not to get killed by something that doesn't have a box next to it on a coroner's report.\n\nIt all started a few months back, while I was waiting tables at the Whistle Stop. The Whistle is a small little restaurant in Glendale, Kentucky that serves up the best southern dishes and desserts in the area. Folks travel everywhere from Louisville to out of state, and I've even served folks from as far away as Cali and Alaska. We have many regulars, but it's not uncommon to see strange folks here, even if Glendale is literally a one-stop-sign kinda place.\n\nThe two women at table ten made me strangely uneasy from the beginning, requesting a table as far away from any of the others as possible. When Hailey, the hostess, sat them at table ten , I felt an inside groan. Table ten- the haunted table. Not that anyone had actually seen a ghost, but unexplainable things always seem to happen there. Drinks will unexplainably topple over or dishes will slip out of even the most experienced servers' hands. No matter who is sitting at table ten, you just know something is going to happen.\n\nI smiled my most winning smile at the two ladies. One of the women looked to be in her mid-thirties, with dark hair and eyes. She was well-dressed in a pair of slacks with a form-fitting shirt that made it clear she was in excellent shape, and a jacket that matched her sensibly-low heels. In short, she was dressed like Beckett in an episode of Castle, or any other female cop in a prime-time, murder-porn TV show.\n\nThe other looked to be in her mid-twenties, with long, wild sandy blonde hair that fell in waves past her shoulders. It looked like it had not been brushed in several days. She was wearing faded jeans and sneakers, and a faded black Realtree sweatshirt with cammo lettering.\n\nIn short, these women could not have appeared less likely to be dining together. But whatever. I'm not here to ask questions, right?\n\nThe well-dressed woman said she had eaten earlier and simply ordered water with a slight English accent. The younger woman ordered country-style steak, two orders of fried chicken, and two slices of Kentucky pie. I wondered how someone could possibly put away that much food , but hey… big bill, big tip. Who am I to question? Maybe she had a tapeworm.\n\nI had just finished scrubbing the tea urns after promising my manager Tess that I would lock up. The women were the last two people other than myself in the building and I had already cleared the dishes and was waiting for them to pay and leave. I finished closing work in the kitchen and headed out the back door that lead to the dining area and around to the front of the building to check that the lights were off. I was about to round the corner into their section when I first caught wind of their conversation . I should have just delivered the bill and minded my own fucking business. But I've never been good at being sensible. I slipped silently into the next dining room area to listen as pieces of their conversation floated towards me.\n\n\"….. Can't kill him, he holds too much power…\"\n\n\"Even the witches would not dare .\"\n\n\"….Can't control the pack for much longer.\"\n\n\"Vampires have not had a council outside what the Vatican controls in centuries,\"\n\nWhat the fuck? Murder? Witches? Vampires in the Vatican?\n\nActually having been raised Catholic, that last part I could believe.\n\nI was still hiding in the next dining room when they went silent. Could they hear me? Did they know I was back there? I crawled my way to the doorway that connected the two dining room, hoping to covertly peek around the corner. I prayed the damn ancient saloon-style double doors wouldn't squeak too much when I opened them. Then again, I wasn't exactly able crawl all that silently, either. The building is over 120 years old and has all the original flooring. It groans and squeaks with just about every movement. I cursed all the times I chose tacos over going to the gym as I gingerly tried to make my way to the doors.\n\nWhen I got there, I decided not to risk trying to open the doors. Instead, I stuck my head under them only far enough to look under the booths to double check that the two ladies were still there. I briefly praised my own foresight in having already throughly swept and mopped the floor. Maybe Grandpa's half-eaten biscuits and gravy wouldn't end up in my hair.\n\nTable ten was empty.\n\nI was so shocked I went to stand up so quickly I forgot I was under the doors, and cracked my head. I rubbed the rising knot on my scalp and looked around, but there was no sign of the two women. I rushed around the restaurant seeing if maybe they had gone to use the restroom before paying their bill. No dice. I even checked the kitchen. Nothing.\n\nI heaved a sigh. Great. Now not only am I the last one here, my last table was two crazy ladies who dined and dashed on me. Assholes.\n\nI finished my last duties and stepped out the back door into the cool autumn evening. We were already busy when I arrived at work earlier, so I had to park clear down Railroad Avenue , and I had a fairly long walk in the dark ahead of me. The streetlights had gone out a while back but Glendale prides itself on being a \"community\" rather than an actual town. The result was nobody had gotten around to fixing the lights. The median age of the residents being somewhere between 75 and death, everyone was well inside and likely already asleep by the time dark fell. Fixing the streetlights wasn't on anyone's priority list.\n\nI walked past the antique mall and shuddered at the eerie sight of porcelain dolls staring at me in the darkened window display. As I walked down Railroad the houses stopped and there was nothing but cornfield on either side of the little road. I always hate walking by myself simply because it always feels as if someone, something is out there. This night was no different and I tried to walk faster but I could not shake the feeling that I was being watched. Stalked.\n\nWhen I finally reached my car my hands were clammy and shaking as I dug around my purse for my key fob. I heaved a sigh of relief when my hand found the fob, and went to pull it out when a black blur whizzed beside me.\n\nBefore I could blink, I was on my back in a small grassy patch in front of the cornfield, staring into the eyes of the English-accented well-dressed woman. I gasped for breath, the force of her take-down having knocked the wind out of me. I stared into her eyes, continuing to gasp for breath and not piss myself. Her eyes seemed different. Feral. They caught and reflected the moonlight the way animals' eyes do. She bared her teeth at me, revealing canine teeth that were… well, canine-like. It was like staring into the face of someone who had just stepped away from filming a scene for True Blood. I mentally counted down the weeks until Halloween. It seemed far too early to be attending a Halloween costume party.\n\nIt sounded like someone else's voice as I gasped out \"wha..wha..what do you want?!\"\n\nI had hoped to sound defiant. Fearless. Instead, I sounded like an asthmatic mouse with an anxiety disorder. Fabulous.\n\n\"What did you hear?\" Her voice sounded like a growl.\n\n\"Huh? N-n-nothing!\" I squeaked.\n\n\"Bollocks. I can smell the lies on you. Now is not the time to bullshit. I have other ways of getting the truth from you.\" Shit. I'm gonna die.\n\nThe younger woman's face suddenly loomed over me. She spoke with a thick southern accent, but it wasn't local. \"Just kill her and let's go before one of these blue hairs decides to talk a late-night stroll. We have to get going. This little bitch isn't going to fuck up us finding my father or talk shit to the wrong people. She's a loose end. Get rid of her.\"\n\nI started to scream, hoping one of \"those blue hairs\" would actually be on a stroll, but the well-dressed woman quickly put her hand over my mouth. She looked up at the younger woman and sneered. \"Bloodshed isn't necessary here. This one might be useful. If nothing else, she might know something.\" She looked down at me. \" I suggest you stay quiet. I may be reasonable but my associate here would rip your throat out with her teeth and not think twice. She's rather rash, that one. So be a good girl, hmmm? Now, look at me.\"\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut. I didn't want to look into those strange, feral eyes. She shook me hard.\n\n\"Look at me or I swear, they'll never find what's left of you. Genevieve? Perhaps you might emphasize my point? Let's let our little waitress know this is no idle threat.\"\n\nMy eyes were still glued shut when I heard what sounded like the growl of a very large animal. It was deeper and more menacing than any animal I had ever encountered. At the sound of it my eyes snapped open. The well-dressed woman smiled, revealing those horribly pointed teeth.\n\n\"Very good. Now, look at me.There's a good girl.\"\n\nI stared into those fearsome, strange eyes and they seemed to start to glow. I felt myself become strangely calm. The glow of her eyes seemed to intensify, and I felt my body becoming heavy. I felt myself falling…falling. I was falling into blackness when I heard her faintly say \"Good. Now we are going go for a bit of a ride…..\"\n\nThe world went black.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

As my vision cleared, I realized I was in an unfamiliar room. The walls were made of rough-hewn stone, and a single flickering lantern cast eerie shadows across the space. I was lying on a small cot, my wrists and ankles bound with thick rope.\n\n\"Welcome back to the land of the living, darling,\" a familiar voice with an English accent said.\n\nI turned my head to see the well-dressed woman from the restaurant sitting in a chair nearby, her legs crossed casually as if we were having a pleasant chat over tea.\n\n\"Where am I? What do you want with me?\" I croaked, my throat dry and raw.\n\nShe smiled, revealing those unnaturally sharp teeth. \"You're in a safe place, for now. As for what we want, well, that depends entirely on you, Kristin.\"\n\nA chill ran down my spine. How did she know my name?\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"you've stumbled into something much bigger than yourself. A war is brewing between the supernatural races, and we can't afford to have any... loose ends.\"\n\nThe younger woman, Genevieve, emerged from the shadows. \"I still say we should just kill her and be done with it,\" she growled.\n\nThe English woman shot her a warning glance. \"Patience, Gen. She might prove useful.\" She turned back to me. \"Now, Kristin, I'm going to ask you some questions. Your life depends on how you answer them.\"\n\nOver the next few hours, they grilled me about everything I'd heard at the restaurant, who I might have told, and what I knew about the supernatural world. I answered as honestly as I could, which wasn't much. By the end, I was exhausted and terrified.\n\n\"Well,\" the English woman said, standing up. \"It seems you truly don't know anything of value. However, that doesn't mean you can't be of use to us.\"\n\nGenevieve's eyes lit up. \"Can I turn her? We could use another wolf in the pack.\"\n\nMy heart raced. Turn me? Wolf? This couldn't be real.\n\nThe English woman shook her head. \"No, I have a better idea. Kristin here is going to be our eyes and ears in Glendale. A spy, if you will.\"\n\n\"What? No, I can't—\" I started to protest, but she cut me off.\n\n\"You don't have a choice, dear. It's either that or Genevieve here gets to have her way with you. And trust me, you don't want that.\"\n\nI swallowed hard, realizing I was trapped. \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\nShe smiled, a predatory gleam in her eyes. \"It's simple. You go back to your normal life, but you keep your eyes and ears open. Any strange occurrences, any newcomers to town, anything out of the ordinary – you report it to us. We'll be in touch.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\" I asked, already knowing the answer.\n\nGenevieve grinned, showing off her own set of sharp teeth. \"Then we have ourselves a nice little snack.\"\n\nThe English woman nodded. \"So, do we have a deal?\"\n\nI closed my eyes, feeling the weight of my new reality crushing down on me. My life as I knew it was over. I was now caught in the middle of a supernatural war, forced to be a spy for creatures I didn't even believe existed until a few hours ago.\n\n\"Yes,\" I whispered, defeated. \"We have a deal.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" the English woman said, clapping her hands together. \"Oh, and one more thing. My name is Victoria. Welcome to the world of the supernatural, Kristin. Try not to get yourself killed.\"\n\nAs they untied me and prepared to take me back to Glendale, I couldn't help but wonder how I was going to explain my absence to my boss, or how I was going to keep this secret from everyone I knew. But more than that, I wondered how I was going to survive in this new, terrifying world I'd been thrust into.\n\nOne thing was certain: my life would never be the same again.

{"id": "text_completion_020", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: No one I\"ve come across in my travels know as to how the curse our world has been given was triggered. What I do know is that we are born with this sickness. This sickness is onset with prolonged sleep. Slowly but consistently it eats away at the mind of the individual leading to an ultimate state of insanity. The result is a mindless, caricature of a former life.\n\n\nThe sickness only occurs with humans, at the very least I\"ve never seen an animal like them. They show no interest in animal life and occupy their time with the chaotic desire to kill and consume humans. They are especially effective at this. It must have been a lifetime ago since I had the pleasure of conversation with another.\n\nTruth be told, it was a lifetime away.\n\nI was imprisoned at the Fort Briggs; at least this was what the guard told me. I don\"t remember what caused me to be imprisoned or anything beforehand-not sure why. In any event I awoke to a soldier looming over me. The surprise almost caused me to swiftly get to an upright position to greet my company but something in his eyes sent a chill to my heart as if the spear he was also carrying had already impaled my heart. But no, he only sat there resting against the cell, looking not so much at me as in me. It was like my soul was stripped naked and studied, his sunken glare penetrating its very depth.\n\n\"Well you\"re not one of them, yet anyway. I\"m no murderer but perhaps a fool. I couldn\"t bring it upon myself to pierce your heart as you slept. I\"ve seen the signs though. The cold sweats, the fear, and then nothing. Or at least for a few moments; they finally awake and it\"s done. They just start killing and...\"\n\nHis voice trailed off as he dropped his head. At this point I was upright but I hadn\"t made any sudden movements. I have never met a distraught man but this seems like the situation.\n\nBut as if possessed he jumped up and whispered,\n\n\"They eat us! I-I\"ve seen it!\"\n\nThe dread and repulsion present in his voice was now gone and he returned to his initial position.\n\n\"We all knew that sleep causes it, and we fought it off for as long as we could. At last, not all of us had the same resolve. It was a recruit, a young lad who\"ve never seen a battle or felt a woman\"s warmth. He thought it a good notion to rest his eyes while on guard duty. When they found him, he attacked one of us in the most vicious manner I have ever seen. To think a boy could rip a grown man\"s throat asunder! They were able to hack his head off but it wasn\"t long before more and more of us started to drop. It\"s when you go without sleep that you truly realize how precious the comfort of it is. And so, I\"m all that\"s left. My brothers-in-arms have all given in. Out of fear of them I protected myself in this cell, only to discover you. \"\n\nAfterwards he became quiet, as if he had been waiting endlessly to have someone to speak to. Assuming he was waiting for my retort to this I probed him on my location and such details.\n\n\"This is Fort Briggs; you are rather deep in the northern region of Iscariot. I couldn\"t tell you why you are here but you have surely been blessed by Tali. There is no one left out there, just them.\"\n\nIscariot is the \"land of blood\" as it\"s known. It has conquered several nations; it was thought that the Gods themselves had chosen for Iscariot to rule over all. Fort Briggs is a colossal structure that was created by the now vanished Titans. It occupies a small fissure between two steep highlands, making it the only plausible way to enter Iscariot land from the north. He referred to the Goddess Tali, which is an interesting note as Tali is not worshipped in Iscariot but in Ishla; a country mostly comprised of desert and chasms.\n\nI was so occupied in my thoughts that I didn\"t notice the sound of something approaching. The soldier was more alert and gestured for me to remain still and silent. The sound of iron boots grew steadily louder and louder as if it was ensnaring us, trapping us. And as gradually as it appeared, the steps began to drift off-but never did it go away. I never saw anyone but I did notice the soldier. It was if Death itself had gently brushed pass him, taking both his skin color and calm demeanor. I questioned the fear stricken man about what it was.\n\n\"Them.\"\n\nIt was clear that he was on the verge of insanity. I wouldn\"t blame the poor soul. If he has indeed gone some stretched period without sleep then his state of mind has surely been warped. Seeing this it created an instinctive fear in me. I did not intend to wait in this cell for starvation or madness to overtake me. I made my way towards the cell door, but in a sudden moment the soldier had pointed his spear at me. Those cold, merciless eyes had returned but now with a glint of murderous intent.\n\n\"I empathize with you. I too have pondered the prospect of escape from this cell, to fight my way out of the Fort and so on and so forth. No one desires to experience the humility of being a caged animal but this is how it is. To leave this cell, this haven, would result only in a gruesome death.\"\n\nThis man has truly given in to fear and has lost hope of escaping our hell. Not deterred I made my intentions clear to him of me finding my own way out, with or without him.\n\n\"You will forgive me then. I have known you for a few moments but in those you have made me think you a sensible person. However, I won\"t allow you to potentially jeopardize me! If they find you, then they\"ll find me and I intend to go on with the rest of my days.\n\nI\"m sorry friend.\"\n\nBefore I had time to respond the soldier lunged his spear towards me. Perhaps Tali is watching after me as the spear struck just under my right arm and collided with the stone wall. The resulting jolt caused the soldier to drop the spear at which I tackled him. I had never been in a situation like this, where I had to fight for my life. We both desperately grasped for each other\"s neck while rolling to and fro. I saw the veins rise in his face and his eyes bulge and turn bloodshot. I felt the heat of his skin against mine and the throbbing of his pulse.\n\nI was going to die.\n\nThe soldier had obviously been trained to kill and was quite stronger than me and I gradually loosened my grip until he was on top of me and was I was near done for. It was during this I noticed his spear just within reach. With a stretch for life I snatched the weapon and struck him across the face. He stumbled over and grasped his bleeding ear. Not waiting for him to recover I attacked. It wasn\"t so much intentional as my body just knew what it had to do. His iron armor covered most of his body so I gouged his face over and over. The squishy noise of each strike felt dark yet consoling and I continued. Blood and other stuff peppered over my face, while his was a red unidentifiable mass-and yet I continued.\n\nEventually I regained my composure and disgusted at myself I dropped the spear and sat against the opposing wall. It is one thing to hear about people being killed and dying but this was up close and personal. It was a rush at first but now a sober cold sensation remained. I forced myself not to think about what had just transpired. I needed to escape. After searching his body, I did not find a key to the padlock. A few hours went by as I tried to formulate another plan. It was during this I noticed the sound of water running. It grew louder near the rear wall, and upon closer inspection I noticed the water was running from beneath the stone floor. It was cracked in several sections and the thought of breaking open a hole could be possible with the spear. So I enveloped myself in this endeavor, quietly but slowly as not to draw the attention of whatever they are.\n\nOver the course of what was likely several hours I was able to create a big enough hole to at the very least see what lied beneath. It seemed like a sewer of some sort but it was an escape. With the hole open, I only had to chip away at the sides and rather rapidly in contrast to my initial progress it grew to I was able to squeeze through. However the thought occurred to me that I may have to fight my way out and if so I could make better use of the corpse\"s armor than he did. It wasn\"t as heavy as I thought it would be but the added size required I expand the hole more.\n\nI found myself now in a dark sewer like burrow. It was too dark to see what I was stepping in but I tried not to think about it nonetheless. Treading the thick liquid in full armor was not pleasant. Mounted in a corner was a torch which I carried with me as I cautiously made my way through the ever-curving tunnel. I had to hold the spear in one hand and its weight became more noticeable. Its tip was also twisted and rounded from it being used to break through the floor.\n\nEventually I came across a metal ladder to a manhole. Holding the torch in one hand, the spear in my mouth I climbed the ladder but found that the manhole was exceedingly heavy. Again, the spear was used to break it lose and I was able to crack it open and subsequently open to reveal a grey sky. I then remembered the northern region of Iscariot is consistently cold, with snow falling year-round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I saw them.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Continuation:\n\nThey were exactly as the soldier had described - mindless, violent caricatures of their former selves. A group of five stood mere yards away, their hollow eyes fixed upon me as I emerged from the manhole. Their bodies were gaunt, skin pale and hanging loosely from their frames. Some still wore tattered remnants of clothing, while others were nearly naked, exposed to the biting cold that seemed not to affect them.\n\nFor a moment, we stood frozen, sizing each other up. Then, as if responding to some unheard signal, they charged. Their movements were erratic, yet purposeful, driven by an insatiable hunger for human flesh.\n\nI barely had time to hoist myself fully out of the manhole before the first one reached me. It lunged, teeth bared, aiming for my throat. The armor I'd taken from the soldier proved its worth as the creature's teeth scraped harmlessly against the metal. With a grunt, I swung the spear, catching it in the side of the head. The impact sent it sprawling, but it quickly scrambled to its feet, unfazed.\n\nThe others were upon me now, clawing and biting at any exposed flesh they could find. I fought desperately, swinging the spear in wide arcs, trying to keep them at bay. One managed to grab my arm, its grip inhumanly strong. I could feel its nails digging into the gaps in my armor, drawing blood.\n\nIn that moment of panic, I remembered the torch still clutched in my other hand. Without hesitation, I thrust it into the creature's face. The effect was immediate and horrifying. It reeled back, screeching, its flesh sizzling and melting away. The stench of burning meat filled the air, causing the other attackers to momentarily hesitate.\n\nI seized the opportunity, swinging the torch in a wide arc, forcing them back. Then I ran. I ran as I'd never run before, my lungs burning in the frigid air, the weight of the armor slowing me down but potentially saving my life.\n\nAs I fled, I took in my surroundings. I was in what appeared to be the outer courtyard of Fort Briggs. The massive walls loomed on all sides, offering both protection and imprisonment. Snow blanketed everything, muffling my footsteps and those of my pursuers.\n\nI could hear them behind me, their inhuman shrieks echoing off the stone walls. I didn't dare look back, focusing instead on finding a way out or a place to hide. Ahead, I spotted a small guardhouse, its door slightly ajar. It was a risk, but I had no choice.\n\nI burst through the door, slamming it shut behind me and frantically looking for something to barricade it with. The room was sparse, containing only a small table and a few chairs. I quickly wedged these against the door, just as the creatures slammed into it from the other side.\n\nAs I caught my breath, I surveyed my temporary sanctuary. It was then that I noticed something odd - a faint glow coming from beneath a loose floorboard. Curiosity overcame caution, and I pried it up, revealing a small, leather-bound book.\n\nThe pounding on the door intensified as I opened the book with trembling hands. Its pages were filled with cramped, hurried writing. As I skimmed its contents, my heart raced. This wasn't just any book - it was a journal, detailing the origins of the curse that had befallen our world.\n\nAccording to the journal, the curse was not natural, nor was it divine punishment. It was man-made, the result of a military experiment gone horribly wrong. The Iscariots, in their quest for power, had sought to create the perfect soldier - one that didn't need sleep, food, or rest. But they had tampered with forces beyond their understanding.\n\nThe experiment had backfired, creating instead a plague that spread rapidly through the population. Those infected lost their minds, becoming the violent, sleepless monsters I had encountered. The journal's author, a scientist involved in the project, had written this account as a confession and a warning.\n\nAs I read, a chill ran down my spine. The last entry caught my eye:\n\n\"There may be hope yet. Our research suggests that those with a rare genetic mutation might be immune to the effects of the curse. They can sleep without succumbing to the madness. If such individuals exist, they could be the key to developing a cure. But time is running out. Already, the infected outnumber us. May the gods have mercy on our souls for what we've done.\"\n\nThe realization hit me like a thunderbolt. I had slept. I had been unconscious in that cell for who knows how long, yet I hadn't turned. Could I be one of these immune individuals?\n\nThe door splintered, jolting me back to reality. I clutched the journal to my chest, knowing its information could be crucial for the survival of humanity. But first, I had to survive myself.\n\nAs the creatures broke through, I steeled myself for another fight. But this time, I wasn't just fighting for my own survival. I was fighting for hope, for a cure, for redemption of our cursed world. With renewed determination, I raised my spear and torch, ready to face whatever came next.\n\nThe battle ahead would be long and perilous, but for the first time since awakening in that cell, I felt a glimmer of purpose. If I could make it out of Fort Briggs alive, perhaps I could find others like me. Together, we might have a chance at reversing this curse and reclaiming our world from the nightmare it had become.\n\nAs the first creature lunged at me, I whispered a silent prayer to Tali, hoping that her protection would see me through the trials to come.

{"id": "text_completion_021", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Whatever you do, be aware of your surroundings. Be aware of everything. Capture every motion, whether you use your brain or you phone. Capture. Every. Single. Detail. You are in a new world, you are disoriented, you don't know where to go. Just use this guide, and you'll be fine.\n\n\nI am here for some time, let's say about three months. I have already experienced that there are no humans, as far as I know. We are in a dystopia, and your main goal is to survive. That's why I requested you to capture everything, this can be proof later on that this world exists.\n\nAlso, there are just a few animals. Only some birds and not many other species. There are so called '*Crytids'.* These are the monsters of this planet, and to kill them you need to use your machete and stab in its eye. They are two feet high and their eyes are on top of their heads. It's easy visible because the head is just at the top of its body. But watch out, they are really fast, approximately they run at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The reason they can achieve such high speeds is because they run at all fours, excluding one weird limb at the back of them. It looks like a leg but is probably useless. They look just a slightly bit like a dog, so don't mistake a Crytid with a dog. Because we have Crytids, but no dogs.\n\nThe way to recognize those bastards is because your arms are going to tingle, which is an inevitable and undeniable feeling. Your surroundings will all suddenly go quiet. This is the most obvious sound a Crytid is near. So be aware of those things. Have your machete ready and prepare for a fight.\n\nIn this world there are a ton of Crytids, unfortunate for us. The first encounter with such a thing is often incredibly scary. But whenever you have fought with a couple of them, they will be easier to conquer and also easier to recognize when one of them is nearby.\n\nSorry, almost forgot to mention that they aim for your weak parts. In this case they aim for your legs. They do this so you can't walk and thus will be an easier target for them because you won't be bigger. When a Crytid is going to attack you, make sure to be fast with your feet. And of course your machete.\n\nThe goal why you are put into this world is a mystery for me either. I don't have a specific answer to a question so diverse. The most likely answer would be that you have been a naughty boy, a very naughty boy. Nah, jokes aside. This might've been a punishment because you were a bad guy in your previous world. Probably planet Earth, which was in my case.\n\nHowever, I have no clue why I have been banned to this planet. Perhaps God thought it might be fun for me to give me a more challenging life, in which he sure accomplished. Although I am missing my friends and family at this point. I might know how to escape this world, but I am not sure.\n\nEvery. Single. Thing. Might not even be real. You simply don't know what is and what is not. But to escape this world, I need a partner. So if you have received this letter, you know what is waiting for you. My name is Blade. When we meet you can recognize me by my red baseball hat, and black protection gear. If you can't immediately see me, everywhere I go I put on the roof a tiny orange flag. I do this to know to which places I've been and which places are prohibited by me.\n\nThere are, nonetheless this is a really weird world, a couple of important buildings;\n\n\\- Head Building of Destruction. This used to be an office for guns. Whether it be the manufacture or testing of guns; you can name it all. It's a big building which is approx. 30 feet high and 25 feet wide. This building is easily recognizable by its American flag at the front side. (I have no idea why the American flag but whatever). The office also has a gun painted on the roof, so from the top view you can also see it. The building overall is like a giant box, with black painted walls from the outside. It has 6 feet high windows at the front side which gives you a clear view of what is inside. I recommend if you see the Head Building of Destruction that you go inside if the coast is clear and get yourself a better battle weapon. Like a semi-automatic weapon is good but a couple of knives are great, too. It's up to you. But keep this building in mind because there sure will be some weapons inside which can be optimal in a fight against Crytids.\n\n\\- Personal Supermarket. This is just a small 40 by 40 feet supermarket which offers the essential products to survive in this world. Like water, bread, rice et cetera. This is also good to check-out when you see it. The Personal Supermarket has its name in red letters in front of a green square. It has two lampposts at the side of it, in which the electricity has already ran out.\n\n\\- Crytid's Cave. Like the name already says, this is the cave of all the Crytids. Stay at all cost, away from it. If, however, just one Crytid notices you, they all come for you. The Crytid's cave is a really big cave on a huge hill. This hill lays in a desert and is easy noticeable from a pretty far distance. I had to run for my life one time, so I recommend you shouldn't go there.\n\n\\- Centre of Everything. This is the centre of this place, and is a hotspot for Crytids, so if you are going to this place, make sure you have your machete ready. Otherwise, don't go to this place if you are not ready to battle. I have been to here one time, and it's pretty impressive, so you'd be better off to stay away.\n\n\\- The Point. This is the place where you woke up. It's a meeting point for all the people that escaped this place and is easy visible because it has a sign which says; \"This is where the end has started\". I know this, because people have led me to it, but I couldn't go yet. This is an important place to meet someone, so keep that in mind.\n\nHopefully this guide helped you a bit, if you find this letter, meet me tomorrow at The Point. Right when the sun rises. You can recognize me by my red baseball hat and black protection gear. I'll wait for you.\n\nRegards, Blade.\n\n\n\n'Wow' I said, 'That was an intense guide and invitation to this world!'. I sighed, 'But I am really curious who this Blade guy is, he seems cool.' I said to myself. Right as I wanted to explore my surroundings a bit, my arm began tingling. I remember what Blade said; *The way to recognize those bastards is because your arms are going to tingle, which is an inevitable and undeniable feeling.* So I knew there was a Crytid lurking at me. I quickly searched for my machete, which was in my backpack next to me. I got it and silently waited for it. Within a split second it sprinted to me. I was scared but aimed for the eye, it aimed for my leg. I stabbed as hard as I could and I was unbelievably scared. But after one stab in its eye, it fell down on the ground, obviously dead. 'Pfew, that was close and scary', I said, 'but oh man, it felt so good.'\n\nWith my machete in my pocket and the disoriented feeling fading away, I started to explore my surroundings a bit, waiting for the sun to go under and rise again, so I could meet Blade.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The landscape was barren and alien, with strange rock formations and an eerie silence that seemed to hang in the air like a thick fog.\n\nI stumbled upon what appeared to be the Personal Supermarket Blade had mentioned. Its green square sign with red letters was faded but still visible. Cautiously, I approached the building, my machete at the ready. The automatic doors were broken, hanging off their hinges, so I squeezed through the gap.\n\nInside, the air was stale and musty. Most of the shelves were empty, but I managed to find some canned goods and bottled water. As I stuffed my backpack with supplies, I heard a faint scratching sound coming from the back of the store. My arm began to tingle.\n\nI froze, my heart racing. Slowly, I reached for my machete. The scratching grew louder, and I could hear the rapid patter of feet on linoleum. I turned just in time to see a Crytid burst from behind a fallen shelf, its eyes gleaming atop its dog-like body.\n\nRemembering Blade's advice, I focused on its eyes and readied myself. The creature lunged, aiming for my legs. I sidestepped and swung my machete, but the Crytid was faster than I anticipated. It grazed my calf, sending a sharp pain through my leg.\n\nGritting my teeth, I pivoted and thrust my machete forward. The blade found its mark, sinking into the creature's eye. It let out a horrific shriek before collapsing to the ground.\n\nPanting heavily, I leaned against a shelf to catch my breath. The encounter had been even more terrifying than the first, but I felt a small surge of pride at having survived.\n\nAs night fell, I found a secure corner of the supermarket to rest. Sleep came fitfully, filled with nightmares of Crytids and the world I'd left behind.\n\nWhen dawn broke, I made my way back to The Point, eager to meet Blade. As the sun crested the horizon, I spotted a figure in the distance. The red baseball cap and black protective gear were unmistakable.\n\n\"You made it,\" Blade said as I approached. His voice was gruff but not unkind. \"I'm glad you found my letter.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the guide,\" I replied. \"It saved my life twice already.\"\n\nBlade nodded. \"Good. You'll need those skills. Listen, I didn't tell you everything in the letter. There's more to this world than just surviving the Crytids.\"\n\nHe gestured for me to follow him. As we walked, Blade explained that he'd discovered clues about the true nature of this world and why we were here. He believed there was a way to escape, but it would require exploring the Centre of Everything – the most dangerous area we knew of.\n\n\"I couldn't do it alone,\" Blade said. \"But together, we might have a chance.\"\n\nI considered his words. The thought of facing more Crytids terrified me, but the possibility of escaping this nightmare world was too tempting to ignore.\n\n\"I'm in,\" I said firmly. \"What's the plan?\"\n\nBlade smiled grimly. \"First, we need to gear up. We're going to raid the Head Building of Destruction. Then, we make our way to the Centre of Everything. Whatever put us here, whatever's controlling this world – that's where we'll find answers.\"\n\nAs we set off toward the Head Building of Destruction, I couldn't help but feel a mix of fear and excitement. This world was dangerous and unpredictable, but with Blade's experience and my growing skills, we had a chance.

{"id": "text_completion_022", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The look in each of their eyes was enough. It stopped me, as it would any other, in my tracks. The look of pure terror, tears streaming from their eyes. \"no, please stop.\" \"take whatever it is you want!\" These were words I had never expected to hear, not even in the darkest of circumstances. Too little too late, I assume. After all, we are in this situation, regardless of what I grew to expect over the last few years.\n\n\nThe room, although covered in light from an old 1990's style ceiling fan, a lamp in the two corners on either side of a work desk that sit just across the room from a couch and loveseat set up, covered in clutter and the computer monitor dancing in bubbles and more light, had seemed dark. Perhaps it was in the air, for I had not come here with girl scout cookies and a young adorable smile. No. I had come here to get the truth out in the open finally.\n\nA year of absolute terror and sadness, as I tracked down my mothers murderer. Following him in secret, lurking behind bushes and following behind his vehicle. The moment is finally here, and his secrets will be revealed.\n\nI asked myself many times already how this man could be the monster he is and still lead a normal life, fathering three children and pretending to be this amazing husband. Grocery shopping, soccer games and cookouts. How in the hell did he manage his time so well, and continue doing what he does in the shadows of night.\n\nLooking down, ignoring the family that are sat around me, bound to each of their own chairs I managed to collect from the dining room table. Five seats lay before me, forming a diamond around the empty chair in the center. This chair is taken though, we just sit in wait for the man of the house. The monster.\n\nMaybe I am getting ahead of myself though. My name. well, this bit is irrelevant to my story, and the end isn't as important but by now you have to be wondering about the little things. Such as, my name, why I am sharing my story with you and who the hell I think I am to tell such a story in the first place. Like I said, I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nWhere was I? oh, yeah, my name. as irrelevant a piece it is, I'll allow you to call me Shadow. I am 19 years old and 2 years ago I found my mother. She had been brutally murdered and no, that Is not an understatement nor is it exaggerated because I am her child. She had been tortured for hours, her face had been swollen from the apparent beatings she suffered. Her stomach had been enlarged where the sick bastard had put the end of a fire exterminater hose into her mouth and hit the trigger. Her eyes were sank in, it had been apparent almost immediately that she had been crying in her last hours, and not because her favorite show was cancelled. The cuts all over her body, where she had been stripped and savagely handled and raped. The sight was ghastly, haunting me at every turn, whenever I found myself asleep or even simply blinking.\n\nThere was no real reason for what happened to her, other than the fact that she had been home and female. This is a fact I came to find after the first six months, studying the other murder/rapes that fit the same M/O.\n\nThe first clue I found was that they had all seemed to follow the sewage system, allowing me to track his next victim, where I learned his identity. My first instinct was to call the police, but by the time I found him, it had been to late. I barely saw his face as he drove past me, but the car screamed at me, for whatever reason. I wrote down his license plate number and using a friends father, I found out who it belonged to. Of course at this time, I had barely any faith that he was my guy, but sure enough.\n\nI found his address and began following him. He was originally using the sewer to track attractive woman and within two weeks they would fall victim to him. Of course, I know you might be wondering why I did not stop him, turn him in or do anything but follow him. Truth is, I was angry, and I wanted others too suffer. Want him off this earth as bad as I had grown too.\n\nTruth is, I wanted too understand him. Why is he doing these things? Why did he feel he had any right to take my mother from me? I lost my father to a drunk driver, hit and run. Imagine my surprise when I found that the drunk driver had been this asshole I spent so much time following. I practically lived in my own car, tracking the pricks every move.\n\nIt was impressive, after each day of work, he would crawl into the sewer at work and begin his hunt. Tracking down a new victim and after he found them, he would get this smile on his face. Bingo. That was my cue. Thirteen more woman after my mother, and guess where he is at the moment I stand at the center of his living room with his family. Victim number fourteen.\n\nI realize at this point, I am no longer any better than him. If ever I was, that day was too long ago to even try to remember or even much think about it. Anyhow, again, I find myself going all over the place.\n\nSo here I stand, the center of attention, if it weren't for the blindfolds covering their eyes. Interesting enough, I got to learn a lot about these four as well, following their father, or husband. I made it a point to write down the point of tonight on the massive blackboard I stole from the school down the street.\n\nThe Truth Will Set You Free.\n\nThe fact of the matter, standing here, I had no idea how exactly the night before me would play out. Ignoring their cries was beginning to get further and further from impossible. \"please let the kids go!\" the mother of three screamed, \"I will do whatever you want, just please. Please let them go.\"\n\n\"oh, sweetheart. If your husband does the right thing, nobody has to get hurt at all.\" I spoke softly, hoping that those words would be more than enough to calm her but as I feared. It had not been enough.\n\n\"why are you doing this!\" she screamed, causing a further riot from the other three. Directly in front of the middle chair sat the wife, so that they could be face to face during the nights events. At his left side Sat his oldest child. A daughter of 16, they must have named under intoxication. Personal opinion aside though, Winter. At his right side, his 13 year old son, Benjamin and behind him, the child that he had allowed to grow so spoiled that he actually fought against my hooded figure, holding a gun to his face. Unloaded or not, an unintelligent choice. Victor.\n\n\"shut the Hell up!\" I screamed, setting down the mobile plastic table for my recent collection of tools. \"the next person to make a fuckin' sound will lose a finger!\" the words, as empty a threat as it had been, were more than enough to calm them down a little.\n\nMy work here was almost done, as I sat my tools on the table and began separating them out on the table. Truth be told, I had no idea where this night was going to go and believe me, I also had no idea how far I was willing to go.\n\nThe truth had to be told though, these people deserved to know the truth about the monster they allowed to lead the family. It took me three months to discover enough about him to truly start my portfolio. His name threw me off the most, it was the name of a real family man, one without the kind of secrets this monster had. Kenny Churkle. What a fucking name.\n\nThe door slamming outside was the cue I waited for and within seconds, the lights were out, and I hid behind the door that when opened would find it smack in the center of all the delight I had in store. The door opened, and before he knew it I had myself wrapped around his throat and the paper towel over his mouth.\n\n\"the truth will set you free.\" I whispered as he slowly collapsed in my arms.\n\nWhen he came too, he found himself the center of attention. His family around him, eyes no longer covered with the garments of clothes I used to form the blindfolds. The mask I was wearing sat beside my tools, which included a scalpel, buck knife, handsaw, wrench, hammer, nails and a few smaller knives and other odds and in things that within the next few hours might be used to inflict pain.\n\n\"Who the hell are you! What do you want? Why are you doing this?\" he asked so quickly that my head began to spin. He sat there tied up, wearing his suit and tie so well. Working late, was his lie. He had to look the part I assume and this was his idea of doing so.\n\n\"I will ask the questions, but first I will give you one more chance to end it all right now.\" I said, kneeling in front of him so that we were face to face. His eyes lead to the soul and weirdly enough, there had somehow been a light, not even flickering. Fear consuming his body and paving way for tears, shakes and pure anxiety. \"tell them where you were tonight, tell them the truth and I will begin to pack my things and make my way on out the door.\"\n\n\"wh-what the hell are you talking about? What truth!\" he asked, the screams of his family got louder as it appeared they understood a wrong answer was not good. He was better off keeping his mouth shut, and if it hadn't been clear when he spoke the words, when I stood up, finding my hand wrapped around the handle of the hammer and swinging myself around and smacking his wife in the face with the brute blunt flat end of the tool, he found that lying, was not an option.\n\nThe blood rushed from the wound, where the hammer tore a decent hole into her left cheek. \"No! leave them alone!\" he screamed at me, Kenny, how dare he pretend to care. How dare he tell me what to do! Turning back to him, heavy breaths escape between clenched jaw grinding teeth. My eyes slit into narrow pathways that led straight to hell themselves.\n\n\"Do you feel in control of the situation, because you should. All it takes is a few simple sentences. You can start with, I moonlight as a…\" I let the sentence hang between us as his wife came too, slowly lifting her head back up. Must have hurt like hell, because her grunts were awful sounding. The silence hung there for too long. \"wow, you really care that much about keeping your secret, you will let them suffer this way?\"\n\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about,\" he cried at me, sobbing, begging his God to end this and let his family just be free. \"I will give you whatever you want, just please.\" He began to beg, and believe me, my skin began to crawl as his avoiding the truth was becoming more than I could take.\n\n\"LIAR!\" I screamed and as I stood back up he began trying to shake free again, as he had tried first when he came to. \"Fine, if you want to play it this way, Winter, I will allow you to come clean first. Show daddy here what revealing the truth really looks like!\" I spat the words towards her father, lifting the hammer towards his face. \"okay dear.\"\n\n\"leave them out of whatever this is, please. You can keep me, let them go.\" Kenny said, \"just let them go!\" he continued to try and shake free, as if that would change anything. In between work, stalking this monster and sleep, I found time to train in self-defense, karate and a couple other fighting techniques before tonight.\n\n\"so winter,\" I said, finding a smile across my face. \"three months ago, a boy crawled through that window, things happened. Tell everyone here what happened, in explicit detail, if you tell the truth, I will slightly cut your right leg but if you lie, Victor over there, loses his ear.\"\n\n\"wh-what?\" their mother stammered, her eyes were blood shot, and her head sitting back up it revealed her jaw must have been messed up or dislocated. \"she-she nev-never had anyone ove-\"\n\n\"his name is Daniel.\" Winter began, but was quickly cut off by her father. Telling her she doesn't have to play my sick games, that he would deal with me and that I was crazy.\n\n\"not playing the game is Not a goddamn option!\" I screamed, slamming the hammer on the table, shaking the rest of my tools and shutting everyone up again. \"I make the rules and for the love of god, if one more of you mother fuckers even tries to interrupt the process again, with anything other than the goddamn truth, I will fucking kill one of you.\" Not only did the words stop them even further than the hammer crashing into the table, but they scared the hell out of me. I never intended to actually commit a murder tonight but I found that not only was I willing to, but if need be, I was going to…\n\nThe knock on the door changed everything. Or did it?\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "[Continuation]:\n\nThe knock on the door sent a jolt of panic through my body. I hadn't anticipated any interruptions. Quickly, I grabbed my mask and slipped it back on.\n\n\"Nobody make a sound,\" I hissed, pressing the hammer against Kenny's temple. \"Or I swear, I'll end this right now.\"\n\nI crept towards the door, my heart pounding in my chest. Through the peephole, I saw a police officer. My mind raced. Had a neighbor heard the commotion? Or was this just a coincidence?\n\n\"Mr. Churkle? This is Officer Daniels. We've had a noise complaint from one of your neighbors. Everything alright in there?\"\n\nI turned back to the family, my eyes wild with fear and determination. Kenny opened his mouth to speak, but I shook my head violently, mouthing \"I'll kill them all\" while pointing at his family.\n\n\"It's fine, officer!\" I called out, trying my best to imitate Kenny's voice. \"Just watching a loud movie. We'll turn it down.\"\n\nThere was a pause. \"Alright, Mr. Churkle. Have a good night.\"\n\nWe all held our breath until we heard the officer's footsteps fade away. I exhaled, removing my mask once again.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, turning back to the family. \"Where were we? Ah, yes. Winter, please continue.\"\n\nWinter, tears streaming down her face, recounted her encounter with Daniel. As she spoke, I saw Kenny's face contort with a mixture of rage and shame. When she finished, I nodded, then picked up the scalpel.\n\n\"You told the truth,\" I said, approaching her. \"So, as promised...\"\n\nI made a small, shallow cut on her right leg. She whimpered, but didn't scream.\n\n\"Your turn, Benjamin,\" I said, turning to the boy. \"Tell us about the cigarettes you've been stealing from your father's desk.\"\n\nBenjamin's eyes widened in shock. \"How did you-\"\n\n\"Just tell the truth,\" I interrupted.\n\nAs Benjamin confessed, I watched Kenny's reactions carefully. The man was unraveling, his façade crumbling before my eyes.\n\n\"And now,\" I said, my voice low and dangerous, \"it's your turn, Kenny. Tell them where you really were tonight. Tell them about the women. About my mother.\"\n\nKenny's eyes darted frantically between me and his family. \"I... I don't know what you're talking about,\" he stammered.\n\nI picked up the hammer again, this time aiming it at Benjamin. \"Last chance, Kenny. The truth, or your son pays the price.\"\n\n\"No!\" Kenny screamed. \"Please, I'll tell you! I'll tell you everything!\"\n\nAnd so, as his family listened in horror, Kenny confessed to his crimes. He spoke of the murders, the rapes, the torture. He admitted to killing my mother, and so many others. With each word, his family's expressions changed from disbelief to disgust to terror.\n\nWhen he finished, the room fell silent. I stood there, trembling, as the weight of his confession settled over us all.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. \"Why did you do it?\"\n\nKenny hung his head. \"I... I don't know. I couldn't stop myself. The urge... it was too strong.\"\n\nI nodded slowly, then turned to his family. \"Now you know the truth. The monster you've been living with all these years.\"\n\nI began untying them, one by one. As I did, I spoke softly. \"I'm sorry you had to find out this way. But you deserved to know the truth.\"\n\nOnce they were free, I handed Kenny's wife a phone. \"Call the police. Tell them everything.\"\n\nAs she dialed with shaking hands, I turned back to Kenny. \"The truth has set you free,\" I said. \"But it's also condemned you.\"\n\nI gathered my tools and headed for the door. Before leaving, I turned back one last time. \"I'm sorry for what I've done here tonight. But I hope you understand why I had to do it.\"\n\nWith that, I disappeared into the night, leaving behind a family shattered by truth, and a monster finally unmasked.

It is what I tell myself I am doing as I stand here year after year, viewing wistfully in the distance towards a collective nothingness. Upon a beach of sea-blue sand, dully reflecting the neverending haze surrounding this place, I stare into the ocean's mist, serving only to further cover everything in the same grey blanket of total blandness. The waters are calm and unmoving, carrying no wind, perfectly still as all else is here. The only movement that reminds me time is not yet frozen is the wavering deep-blue hue the water carries with itself near the shoreline, refracting the sand's gem-like azureness in a listless dance, until once again fading into a lifeless grey. It is all I can do to stare at this hesitant ripple of blue. It draws me in until the dreary atmosphere ever so slowly fades out of my consciousness; a welcome refuge for my tired eyes.\n\n\nI am unsure when I first arrived at this place, it happened much like how one might forget a dream. Awaking with a moment of unfamiliarity, and a distant memory of a place that dives farther from your mind each second you try to grasp at it, until all that\"s left is the memory that there was something that happened, some thought that you engaged with thoroughly, but remembered nevermore. I had tried to find a way to get away from here. I've ran along these sands many times in search of solidarity from this place, but alas, the beach seems infinite in every direction. Even the water itself holds no secrets of escape, for it violently steepens only a few meters from shore, and attempting to run away from the beach is equally futile, I simply appear right back at the ocean after walking only a short distance away, as if this cursed place is just a loop one cannot escape by effort alone.\n\nSo, I stand and stare. Time passes here at a dreadful pace, and I have lost hope of returning to my past life. Even if I somehow rid myself of this place, a mind can only take so much of this desolation before permanently adapting to it. The little solace I hold is writing these words into the sands, for this land's apathetic nature is kind enough to leave the sands unmoving for me to use as a canvas of words and thoughts. There is little else to describe here so this writing will end I suppose. One day I may add to my scriptures in these sands, but this place is making me tired. So, I'll let it take my thoughts to sleep, hoping to dream of a place that isn't here.\n\n\n\nWriting Upon Blue Sands pt. 2, Sinking to Somber:\n\nMy mind skips upon my dead thoughts like these pebbles upon this familiar sea: plip, plop, plip are my thoughts, sinking into cold, lifeless insanity. My mind stands me along this beach once more, my body begging for the back and forth familiarity of flinging rocks towards the open nothingness—anything that isn't another nothing for my senses. I let the thoughts fall from my head and drag my body back to my scrawled words. I return to writing upon these blue sands to exorcise my mind from the silence and the blue.\n\nI think I've found blue to be so… depressing. At first it was a welcome sight from the ocean's horrid blanket of eternal grey, but now my mind is in constant battle between the greys and the blues and the brights and the dulls and the same pattern of refracting light of the water's dance with the sand until my mind simply surrenders to a single muddled color of somber. These are the patterns and contrasts of the sole two colors in this world that I once thought would hold significant importance to my sanity, but now they serve only to constrain my sanity to yet another nothingness.\n\nA mind cannot withstand absolute singularity of a concept for long before breaking; a single color or a single belief and ideal, a single order or a single life, a single one place of consciousness and decision-making that sits in eternal stillness for the extent of one's sanity—as afterwards, constraints on reality no longer matter to a broken mind. It is simply an environment that such a machine was not designed to survive in.\n\nSo, this world blesses me with living upon an eternal balance point between absolute singularity and necessary stimuli with its waveless sea, its stillborn breeze, and its shimmering azure sands that seep into your mind like drops of ink, leaving your thoughts stained forever blue. But again, I am blessed within this world to write within its sands and throw its stones back at itself in childish retaliation. The world could've let my writing disappear as my thoughts do, or let my stones skip only once instead of the occasional twice to my amusement. The world may steal my thoughts and feelings, forever lost within the depths of its sea, but it does allow solidarity from its environment in painfully short moments of self amusement through my actions here.\n\nUnfortunately they are far in-between each other, and once again I am feeling my thoughts having been thoroughly soaked into these sands, wishing to take leave of my head and send me to my nothingness once again. So, I'll lay within these sands, staring at my nothing until my sanity tips too far from its balance point, and I will decide to skip stones again tomorrow or maybe continue my writings here another night. Whichever one my mind has felt is a greater necessity to its survival in this apathetic wasteland of blue sands and lifeless waters.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

At first, I dismissed them as figments of my imagination, a desperate mind clinging to the hope of companionship. But as time stretches on in this endless expanse, the whispers grow more insistent, more real.\n\nThey come to me in the moments between wakefulness and sleep, when the line between reality and dream blurs like the horizon of this forsaken place. The voices are faint, carried on non-existent winds, speaking words I can't quite grasp. Yet their presence alone is enough to stir something within me – a spark of curiosity, a flicker of fear.\n\nI find myself straining to hear them, my ears pricked for any sound beyond the gentle lapping of water against sand. Sometimes, I swear I can make out snippets of conversation, fragments of lives lived beyond this desolate shore. A child's laughter, a lover's whisper, an old man's lament – all echoing across the vast nothingness that surrounds me.\n\nAre these remnants of my former life, memories bubbling up from the depths of my subconscious? Or are they something more? Perhaps I am not as alone in this purgatory as I once believed. The thought both thrills and terrifies me.\n\nI've taken to wandering the shoreline more frequently now, no longer content to simply stand and stare. My eyes scan the misty horizon, searching for any sign of movement, any hint of life beyond my own. The blue sands shift beneath my feet, leaving no trace of my passage. It's as if the beach itself conspires to keep me isolated, erasing any evidence of my existence.\n\nYet still, the whispers persist. They've become a constant companion, a lifeline to which I cling in my darkest moments. I find myself talking back to them, my voice hoarse from disuse. I tell them of my days here, of the endless blue and grey, of the crushing loneliness that threatens to consume me. I don't know if they can hear me, but the act of speaking aloud brings a small measure of comfort.\n\nAs I write these words in the sand, I wonder if perhaps I've finally lost my grip on sanity. Maybe the whispers are nothing more than the desperate fabrications of a mind pushed too far. But even if that's true, I find I no longer care. In this world of nothingness, even the illusion of company is preferable to the stark reality of solitude.\n\nI've begun to craft stories around these phantom voices, giving them names and faces, weaving elaborate tales of how they came to be trapped here with me. There's Maria, a young woman with fiery red hair and a laugh that cuts through the gloom. And old Tom, with his weather-beaten face and tales of adventures on the high seas. Little Sarah, barely more than a child, who sings nursery rhymes to keep her fears at bay.\n\nThese figments of my imagination have become more real to me than my own fading memories of life before this place. I spend my days in conversation with them, arguing, laughing, sharing in their joys and sorrows. The blue sands have become our playground, the misty waters our backdrop.\n\nBut in the quiet moments, when even the whispers fall silent, a creeping doubt gnaws at the edges of my mind. What if I'm not imagining them at all? What if they're real, trapped souls like myself, reaching out across the void? And if that's true, what does it mean for my fate? Am I doomed to become nothing more than a whisper myself, a faint echo in the mist for some future castaway to cling to?\n\nThe thought chills me to my core, and I find myself writing faster, desperate to leave some lasting mark on this unchanging landscape. My words stretch across the blue sands, a testament to my existence, a cry into the void: \"I am here. I am real. I will not be forgotten.\"\n\nAs I finish this entry, the whispers grow louder, more insistent. They seem to be calling me, urging me towards the water's edge. For the first time since I arrived in this place, I feel a breeze on my face, cool and inviting. The mist parts ever so slightly, revealing a faint glimmer of something beyond.\n\nWith trembling steps, I move towards the shoreline. The blue waters lap at my feet, no longer cold and lifeless, but warm and welcoming. The whispers surround me now, a chorus of voices both familiar and strange. They promise answers, companionship, an end to my solitude.\n\nAs I wade deeper into the sea, my words on the sand begin to fade, erased by the gentle waves. But I no longer care. Whatever lies beyond this misty veil, be it salvation or damnation, it calls to me with a siren's song I can no longer resist.\n\nAnd so, I let the blue waters embrace me, carrying me towards an uncertain future. My last thought, as the world fades to azure, is a hope that someone, someday, will find these words I've left behind and remember that I was here.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing, while preserving the established themes of isolation and introspection.", "evaluation_score": 1.0}, {"checklist_id": 1, "reason": "The continuation is engaging and compelling, adding depth to the storyline and characters while maintaining the reader's attention and curiosity.", "evaluation_score": 1.0}, {"checklist_id": 2, "reason": "The continuation is sufficiently long and comprehensive, seamlessly integrating with the preceding text to form a coherent and complete story with well-developed plot arcs and character development.

{"id": "text_completion_024", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: We never thought in our most desperate hour that knowing how many toes on a possum could save a life. Because honestly, who has that kinda knowledge rumbling through their brain ready to be pulled out of their butt? No one. No one except a winner, and most of the time, they\"re just guessing and pulling crap out. But that guess gets them a ticket out of this life, and leaves the rest of us sorry losers in the dirt.\n\n\nThis may sound like ranting because it is. In a system that is already corrupted to the core by chance and social connections, Trivia Hour added an extra topping to that hot mess. At 12 in the afternoon and 6 in the evening, three quarters of the world pulled out some sort of device to gaze hopefully at their last chance for a pleasant life as the clock clicks down to 0 and bright blue words ask \"Are you ready?\". Three quarters of the world will desperately tap answer after answer, feeling their opportunity rising higher and higher until they click that one wrong answer, and they come crashing down into the garbage pile. Nothing matches the excitement of getting a question right and moving to the next round, the ultra combination of exhilaration and adrenaline gunning through your body and setting you on fire. And nothing matches that sub-abyssal low when you miss one, sinking into your stomach and tearing you from the inside out. Its a feeling that stays a lot longer than the high, the feeling that no matter what, no matter who you could\"ve been, you are never getting out. I know what it feels like because just like the other 5 billion, I\"m a sucker to the game. The game, the most hedonistic form of capitalism and emotional manipulation this side of the hill works like this:\n\nThere are 20 question, starting off easy before ramping to nearly impossible. All quick facts, no mathematical equations so I guess we have to thank the creators for that. You answer one wrong, you, and millions and billions, are booted. Here\"s the catch, so it\"s not just the entire population of China randomly guessing and crying into their phone: if you get someone to enter your username in as a referral code, you get a heart. A heart will save you for one wrong question and you can\"t use more than one a game. When the game started off, with only 2 maybe 3 hundred thousand logging in at 12 and 6, it was relatively easy to get a referral code from a friend just joining the game or a relative. But when the numbers kept going up and up as the weeks grew into months then years, you were considered blessed to get a heart, as rare today as finding a diamond amid coal. That\"s where things got ugly. People began to create massive amounts of accounts to get hearts, so the folks at Trivia Hour began demanding confirmation that the person creating an account was a real human. So this led to two things happening: people creating people as fast at they could, either by birthing children or smudging documents, and people going the opposite way, knocking off competitors permanently and stealing their phones in the hopes they could give a heart.\n\nI was born as one of the former options. My parents lived on the poorer end of the middle class spectrum. Kept us in a three-bedroom house in the suburbs on desk-jobs. The game came out when they were in their early twenties, when they already had Macy and Linden. When the Upturn struck, sending the economy into a vicious spiral, the low-end middle class felt in the hardest. After being let go of their jobs, the house in the suburbs was vacated for a slimy apartment in the city and mom and dad picked up work anywhere they could. The game before the Upturn was a fun, exciting way to connect across borders and learn new facts. The game after the Upturn became the light at the end of the tunnel for them. It no longer had that child-like appeal. It was business. Macy and Linden were given cheap phones and accounts when they were three and two, with my parents answering for them. Five years later, mom popped me and Pepper out to get more chances, before succumbing to an infection, probably grown in the petri dish of our home. Dad got desperate when she died. We stopped looking like kids, and more like washed out bed sheets as he struggled to put food on the table. Taking on three jobs was a lot, but Macy, as the oldest, was only 15 and was still required to go to school, just like the rest of us.\n\nIt looked pretty grim for a couple years, until dad was hired by an advertising company for the game, to mandate calls or whatever, and things started to pick up. There was food in the house 24/7 and Mace was given the chance to join an after school club centered around computer technology and design. She had to stay late at school but to her it was worth it, the extra hours. It scared Dad, and he made sure she had a can of mace for Mace. A family joke. It broke him when he got the call she was found in an alley on her way home, half-clothed and with no phone, a full can of mace next to her. It\"d be an understatement to say Dad was never the same after that. He lost his job when they found drugs in his urine tests, so he turned to peddling them on the streets. We didn\"t see him for a full week when it was Linden\"s turn to pick up the phone to the police\"s number. He was 14, and working as hard as he could to keep us all together, lying to social workers and neighbors, pulling hours at the gas station. When he went down to the station to identify the corpse, it was the last straw, and we were all shipped up and sent out to orphanages and foster homes.\n\nSo began my extra ordinary life, living from home to home, going to school when I could, playing the game. Always the game. The one constant in my short, ugly life, the companion to my every misery. Like millions, i considered ending it all. After the Upturn, the government passed legal consent to euthanize those who applied to the program. I even got in the line at the offices to sign up, at 16 years old, 8 years after the last time I knew what a family was. I got up to the desk clerk at 11:59, to this shriveled old hag. I opened my mouth to say good morning, because even with the decomposition of society, I still had manners, and this witch held a hand up and said, in absolute snotty authority,\n\n\"Please wait. The game has started.\"\n\nOn the edge of the cliff, about to throw myself off, I started to laugh. Trivia Hour wouldn\"t even let me end my life. So that\"s when I stopped being sad, stopped feeling like a pitiful sad sack of trash, and got angry instead. Angry at the game, angry at my life, angry at what I had lost, angry that my sister was killed for a heart because no one had one left to give.\n\nI\"m tired of waiting for a game to tell me if I\"m going to make something of my life, if I\"m going to break the chains on question 20. I\"m going to break them when I decide, and I\"ve decide I\"m breaking them now. Trivia Hour won\"t get a second chance because I\"ve no heart to give. Join me if you\"re ready\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

At first, it was met with skepticism and ridicule. \"Another dreamer,\" they said. \"You'll be dead before you make a dent.\" But slowly, quietly, people started to listen.\n\nIt began with a handful of us, meeting in abandoned buildings, whispering plans in the shadows. We called ourselves the Heartless, a bitter joke about our lack of extra chances in the game and in life. Our numbers grew as word spread through the desperate masses yearning for change.\n\nOur first act of rebellion was small but significant. We hacked into the local broadcast of Trivia Hour, replacing the questions with messages of resistance. \"Your worth isn't determined by trivia,\" we proclaimed. \"Life is more than a game.\"\n\nThe authorities cracked down hard, but we were prepared. We scattered, went deeper underground, and planned our next move. We targeted the infrastructure that kept Trivia Hour running – server farms, data centers, transmission towers. Each strike was a blow against the system that had consumed our lives.\n\nAs our movement gained traction, we saw changes in society. People began to question the game's dominance. Some stopped playing altogether, choosing to live with dignity in poverty rather than chase the false promise of salvation through trivia.\n\nBut the game's creators weren't going down without a fight. They introduced new incentives, harsher penalties for non-participants. They branded us terrorists, enemies of progress and prosperity.\n\nThe conflict escalated. Cities became battlegrounds between those loyal to the game and those fighting for freedom from it. I lost friends, saw comrades fall. But for every one we lost, two more joined our cause.\n\nYears passed, and the world changed. Trivia Hour's grip on society loosened, but the scars it left ran deep. We had to rebuild not just our infrastructure, but our very concept of worth and purpose.\n\nI'm older now, my anger tempered by time and hard-won wisdom. I look at the young ones, born after the fall of Trivia Hour, and I see hope. They'll never know the desperation of waiting for a game to determine their fate. They're free to define their own value, to pursue knowledge for its own sake rather than as a lifeline.\n\nSometimes, I catch myself wondering how many toes a possum has.

Congratulations! You've won a month's supply of Kepler Cola... bzzz pip pip. The intercom switched back to space static.\n\n'Ok. Cool. Are you a real person or a galactaspammer? Only I'm a bit busy right now.'\n\n'bzzz pip... No way, I'm a real life person in the publicity department here at Xenon Pops & Beverages inc., a subsidiary of the one and only Kepler Cola Corporation. You've aced, almost aced, our main prize because your, I must say, fabulous star-rise cocktail, incorporating 3 parts Kepler Cola, was selected by our panel of judges who reflect a cross section of representative sentient organic life forms and cola-absorbing, naturally occurring, mineral and liquid sentient chemical compounds. You almost won overall. Your mix tastes great! It also has useful secondary applications, although mostly involving bacteria and ferric oxide.'\n\n'What was first prize?' An array of warning lights flashed around the cabin.\n\n'bzzz pip... That would be a lifetime's supply of Kepler Cola, the most popular drink in the... bzzz pip.'\n\n'Ok. I'll pick it up next time I swing around the core.' The onboard gravity replicator blinked off and popcorn filled the cockpit. It hung in the air like a complaint. The usually soundless gravity replicator, a wide metallic collar held in the vacuum cavity between the dual layers of the hull and spinning almost frictionlessly under the force of molybdenum magnets, was such a thoroughly basic device that the crew rarely remembered it until something 'went all spanners'. As the collar abraded away carbon from the latest inward dent in the hardly flawless exterior hull, matter entered the vacuum and oscillations turned to noise and heat.\n\nThe instrument panel took a neat kick from the pilot, blinked, re-calibrated via a feed-back loop and switched back on. As the inner and outer skins of the hull eased further apart under tension, a gravitational field formed, the noise stopped and fluffy popcorn balls stuck to all available surfaces. A peach pit rattled down the stabiliser panels.\n\n'bzzz... Sounds better. Are you saying you're not on a Government world or station now? How would it be possible to slip past Compliance and leave the atmosphere? How do you get re-supplied?...pip.'\n\n'I'm not registered with the Authority, or aligned to any corporation. I'm not into all that shkush. It's stupid anyway, all that promising within the constitution that the black hole serves the people and the inner planets will never fall in, when that's obviously happening; just look at the time difference between you and the frontier. People out here are living life faster. I like the idea I'll get more birthday presents than I'll give.'\n\n'bzzz... The discrepancy can be explained by seeing only one side of a balancing distortion. All the candidates have been saying so. You cannot seriously be out on the Frontier alone... pip.'\n\n'Kepler Cola's made off world, right? They say the central hub has no space for factories, fruit trees or anything else but people.' Another kick connected the flight-deck to holo-image immersion feed and Exia risked a glance sideways to see with whom she was talking. Without warning, the PR exec found himself dropped into a holo-immersed projection with a metal block the size of a bus pivoting through space straight at him.\n\n'Warping skank! Mind out! What the... was that?' He fell down, seeking the reassurance of a solid surface.\n\n'It helps if you close your eyes if you're not used to it. The metal and carbon stuff is just another bunch of modules spinning crazy dances. It's the same old crash-mash every day. I'm going to have to heal my hull after this one though. The good news is switching to visual stops that bzzz pip rubbish. Yes, I have a scavenger band ship, at least I was in a band but my brother went off. He was annoying, so I gave him the code for the airlock and asked him to go and test it.'\n\n'He died?'\n\n'No such luck. The cheeky brat put a suit on first, vented outside, separated a command module I'd salvaged and spent half a cycle shooting my ship's tail off to annoy me.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Well, for a start it annoyed me but that would also be to break modules off to compile his own ship. How do you not know this stuff?'\n\n'It isn't knowledge on the central syllabus, no. The approved press also don't talk about that, although our news takes a day to clear regulator checks; or more if it's about the black hole. They gave approval for direct communication with you because it's about cola.'\n\n'If it's about cola, that's the priority. Are you worried that your most powerful population centre is oblivious to life outside, conflicting evidence, unsanctioned opinions, reality?'\n\n'You definitely are our most sarcastic finalist. I see your entry includes an offensive adjective in the description which, when taken in isolation from the noun...'\n\n'In space, no one can hear you swear. I can see rebellion isn't quite your thing. I love your pop by the way. My relatives way back were peach farmers and I guess I've always liked the real peach juice in it. I know you'll give me that speech about it being a secret recipe of a dozen chemical compounds with four radioactively-induced herbal-style products and blah blah but I taste peach pop when I drink it.'\n\nExia scraped a heel across the dashboard and a display of options scrolled until she found the one she wanted. 'I'm going to use the tractor beam now to pull this module in. Mind the glare.'\n\nA blue-white finger shafted out and pinned one of the spinning pieces of debris like a moth to the night sky. In silence, it drew the block inward and the ship rotated with the photo-mechanical effort until both watchers were blinded as the arc of a reddened sun crossed their vision. The raw light flashed off the module's flank and through aching eyes they caught glimpses of its intricate design.\n\nOnly Exia felt the temperature rising for the second time that day as latent heat seeped through and flooded the compartment. She feathered the blast screens to deflect heat until the ship turned through and beyond. Raising them again, Exia manoeuvred the module until it locked with a clunk onto a key node of the hull.\n\n'So that's how it's done. I scavenge modules off corporate factions' ships and bolt them onto this one. A medical pod this time – and that's how I re-supply. Some of the pilots don't even care what gets lifted. The boat's not theirs I suppose, or they can't turn off course to deal with scavengers. Sometimes they ask for a date but mostly I just snap bits off them and go.'\n\nExia stood up for the first time in the conversation, put on a discreet visor and started to read.\n\n'What will you do with the medical pod? Sell it?'\n\n'I keep anything that might be useful and if it isn't useful, I keep it for extra armour. It says here, if I get diabetes from drinking too much of your cola, there's a programme for re-coating my liver with working liver cells to fix it. I can run that myself, according to Poodle.'\n\n'Oh no. You really shouldn't search on Poodle. The Azedware Corporation will note the condition to your profile and downgrade your life insurance rating.'\n\nIt dawned upon him that this might be inconsequential, given the vast and unpiloted blocks bouncing into one another behind her incredulous expression.\n\n'If I did report you as a dangerous delinquent, I suppose it wouldn't make much difference?'\n\n'You can if you want but there's not much sign of a Compliance mob out here. I'd scramble the shape of my ship and then my containers and components couldn't be told apart from anyone else's anyway, so go knock yourself out.' She honestly didn't care. 'Has anything improved at the glorious galactic centre in the last two years then?'\n\n'Definitely. There's a major debate about who owns and controls the regulation of time. The corporations prefer to know where they stand legally and the ownership of abstracts and constructs is a whole new field to carve up. If time can be owned, it can be licensed.'\n\n'Away from a planet it's all the same, hours, day and night. You can go mad from having fewer points of reference, like me. What's bed-time? I might never walk into a shop again, so there goes opening hours and I think I've completely lost my concept of Tuesday.'\n\n'Don't you miss it? Planetary life, I mean. Home, routine and family?'\n\n'Home was the Wexler-Watson Corporation. \"Hush kids. Comply or your parents don't get their increment because if we work for Watson, Watson has a beneficial shareholding in our family because he loves families\", which comes of being a computer by the way because he's compensating. Is that lifestyle?'\n\n'Watson isn't evil and neither is PAL for that matter.'\n\n'Who runs Xenon, of course.' Exia threw he head back to laugh and then lost the elegant high- ground, picking popcorn out of her spiky hair. 'I forgot you work for that creepy drone covered in disgusting skuzz, so will be used to licking a few itchy sockets.'\n\n'Which is prejudiced by the way; which is even worse than murder. PAL was originally designated Pizza and Laundry, so began as a delivery bot capable of machine learning. The drone's intelligence and abilities have reached such a level now that it\"s too valuable to deploy outside, so sends out humans to gather data or do anything dangerous. I think PAL just wants to find its purpose, now that all the basic service jobs can be delegated to people, although he still heats pizza at AGMs for shareholders. The only problem is he sometimes takes advice literally. He was told it's a bad idea to go outside without a waterproof outer layer, so he got himself completely coated in human skin. The donor was very well compensated.'\n\n'I'm sure. Well, I prefer it up here. It's not just freedom. I've seen things beyond description. Sprays of sparking magnesium set against the rising disc of a new world as someone's propulsion pod cheese-graters down their hull, skimming a solar mass to collect the denser hydrogen for fuel – you did know space is made of hydrogen and that's free fuel for scavengers? Or running through another faction's flotilla while they're stuck in the queue to hydrate their breakfast gloop and then pulsing to light speed like a comet through their stupid little campfire. Yeah, that's not as cool though as using the tractor to move dust particles in a nebula, which I did so I could write my name in letters twenty miles high that will stand for a few million years. I was the first to do that, incidentally. What did you do on your birthday?'\n\n'I saw an approved film graded 5 for stimulation, which unashamedly misrepresented cultural norms. Okay then, you have a good point but here's a question: How did you get a ship and weapons in the first place? That's not cheap and I don't see an executive currency implant in your finger.'\n\n'Well, put it this way, my surname's Skuttle.'\n\n'What, really? Like the inventor of the lattice neutrino cannon?'\n\n'Just like that, yeah. Norvo and Allegra Skuttle were my parents. It was a nightmare. They were always fighting. Then they improved a solar particle harvester and got investment from the corporations and turned into rich people always fighting, so my brother and I took off a lot. Then Dad discovered how to harden neutrinos into subatomic fabrics, so the forces and bonds between them really hit and separated molecular bonds rather than the neutrinos swishing straight through things, so the lattice neutrino cannon was born.\n\nThe original was on our kitchen table because Dad said if he completed it in the lab then Wexler would take it away. Mum came home and they started shouting and arguing about not telling Watson, then crunch, we were orphans. There was no mess, just us standing in the hall, trying to get our rods and cones back. We didn't hang around that day and spent our parents' Wexcoins on a basic flight module, then went back for the bazooka. I still remember trying to carry it down the walkways. When we found we could rebuild and develop our ship using bits blown off other module ships by molecular de-bonding, that was it: The future calling.'\n\nExia paused. 'Of course, there are other private raiders up here and some skunk designs being tested. I bet you didn't know about those, although they're sure to be corporate. Some factions won't even talk to anyone. They just see you as fair harvest, whether you're commercial haulage or scavenger. There's a particularly nasty bunch called the Twinblades who target your interior inertia negators, so when a ship at high speed stops, after running away or something, the pilot's momentum stays the same and they smash through their front panels, closely followed by everything else in the vessel, just spewing bodies and junk into space. Instant abstract expressionism.'\n\n'That's quite a lot to handle for, what are you, a teenager? I couldn't help noticing that you fly your ship by kicking the controls.'\n\n'That's about reach. This compartment's made for two pilots.'\n\n'Have you even completed pilot training?'\n\n'What's training? When you play pool, do you see it as an exercise in advanced trigonometry or do you just pick up the stick and poke?'\n\n'Fair enough, although it sounds hard staying sane up there without anyone around to talk to. You should realise that one day someone will move into that seat next to you and I wonder if then you'll stop kicking quite so hard, young lady.'\n\nExia made a non-committal huff and checked a compartmental integrity scan, then slipped a couple of fingertips lightly over the joystick, circled his hologram around the room until it stood in and out of the console, looked innocently into his eyes, tilted her head and shut it down hard with an upward thrust of her knee.\n\n'Ouch. Whoah.' Despite the distance, he folded anyway. This so wasn't in the training. 'I'm not without feelings you know and I was also beginning to appreciate your attitude, although I could never be like you, not that you've even asked my name. It took me years to get to H-grade responsibility in this job. If I go further, that's use of a spa and discounted meds. Look, I can help you.\n\nWe have a Xenon continental class mega-freighter coming in from the Algolian wormhole nine hours from now. I could ask them to check your hull and supplies or re-stock your oxygen but they aren't in communication range until they fall out this side of the cusp. It's amazing they always survive the deceleration from warp jump to super-luminal and then the step down to light-speed, but that's thanks to Watson because he cares.'\n\n'...and loves families, I know. Does it have a lifetime's supply of your gorgeous peach pop on it?' A bright smile, at last.\n\n'Several lifetimes, I should think.'\n\n'Ok. Then you were wrong.'\n\n'Sorry?'\n\n'About me settling for second prize... bzz pip.' Dots of popcorn turned into white lines as Exia sent\n\nthe scavenger ship to light-speed.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story, maintaining consistency with the original plot, characters, and tone:\n\nExia's ship streaked through space, leaving behind a bewildered PR executive and his promises of cola. As the stars blurred into streams of light, she couldn't help but grin at the thought of the mega-freighter waiting for her at the end of this journey.\n\nHours passed as Exia fine-tuned her approach, occasionally kicking the console to adjust course. The newly acquired medical pod hummed quietly, its presence a reminder of her recent encounter. She wondered if the PR exec had reported her after all, but quickly dismissed the thought. Out here on the frontier, corporate rules held little sway.\n\nAs the ship decelerated, the Algolian wormhole came into view – a swirling vortex of blues and purples that seemed to devour light itself. Exia's sensors pinged, alerting her to the presence of the Xenon mega-freighter. It was a behemoth, easily a hundred times the size of her cobbled-together vessel.\n\n\"Time to play nice,\" Exia muttered, opening a comm channel. \"Xenon freighter, this is independent vessel requesting assistance. I was told you might have some supplies for me.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence before a gruff voice responded. \"Independent vessel, we have no record of any supply drop. Identify yourself and state your business.\"\n\nExia rolled her eyes. Of course, the PR exec's promise hadn't made it through official channels. She'd have to improvise. \"I'm Exia Skuttle, winner of the Kepler Cola contest. I'm here to claim my prize – a lifetime supply of cola.\"\n\nAnother pause. \"Skuttle? As in the neutrino cannon Skuttle?\"\n\n\"The very same,\" Exia replied, a hint of pride in her voice. \"Now, about that cola...\"\n\nThe comm crackled with hushed whispers before the voice returned. \"We'll need to verify your claim. Prepare for docking procedure.\"\n\nAs Exia maneuvered her ship towards the freighter's docking bay, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The Xenon crew seemed too interested in her name, and she doubted they cared much about a cola contest winner.\n\nThe docking clamps engaged with a metallic thunk, and Exia took a deep breath before opening her airlock. She was greeted by a squad of armed security personnel, their weapons trained on her.\n\n\"Ms. Skuttle,\" a man in a crisp uniform stepped forward. \"I'm Captain Reeves. We've been looking for you for a long time.\"\n\nExia's hand instinctively moved towards her hip, where she kept a small neutrino pistol. \"Is this how you treat all your contest winners?\"\n\nReeves smiled humorlessly. \"You know very well why we're interested in you. Your parents' research – particularly the advancements in neutrino technology – is highly valuable to certain parties.\"\n\n\"My parents are dead,\" Exia spat. \"And I'm not interested in playing corporate games.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" Reeves replied, \"but you possess knowledge that could revolutionize space travel and weaponry. We can't let that potential go to waste.\"\n\nExia's mind raced. She needed a way out, and fast. Her eyes darted around the docking bay, taking in the layout, the personnel, the equipment. Then she spotted it – a stack of Kepler Cola crates near the far wall.\n\nWith a swift motion, Exia drew her pistol and fired at the crates. The neutrino beam struck the pressurized containers, causing them to explode in a fizzy, sugary mess. The sudden chaos provided the distraction she needed.\n\nDucking under the spray of cola, Exia bolted towards an open maintenance hatch. Alarms blared as she navigated through the freighter's cramped service tunnels, the sound of pursuing footsteps echoing behind her.\n\nAs she ran, Exia couldn't help but laugh at the irony. She'd come for cola and ended up in a chase through a labyrinth of corporate greed and scientific exploitation. It was just another day on the Lightspeed Frontier.\n\nRounding a corner, Exia found herself face-to-face with a familiar hologram. The PR exec flickered into view, his expression a mix of concern and excitement.\n\n\"Exia! I'm so sorry – I had no idea they'd try to capture you. I've been monitoring the situation and I think I can help.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, still keeping an ear out for her pursuers. \"Why should I trust you?\"\n\nThe hologram sighed. \"Because despite our differences, I admire your spirit. And frankly, the thought of corporations exploiting your family's research doesn't sit well with me. There's a hangar bay two levels down. I can override the security protocols and give you access to a scout ship.\"\n\nExia hesitated for a moment before nodding. \"Alright, lead the way.\"\n\nAs they made their way to the hangar, the PR exec's hologram flickered beside her. \"You know, I never did tell you my name. It's Zack.\"\n\n\"Well, Zack,\" Exia replied as they reached the hangar doors, \"if we make it out of this alive, I might just buy you a drink. Kepler Cola, of course.\"\n\nThe doors slid open, revealing a sleek scout ship. Exia dashed towards it, the sound of approaching security growing louder.\n\n\"Go!\" Zack's hologram urged. \"And Exia... be careful out there.\"\n\nWith a final nod of thanks, Exia boarded the scout ship and fired up the engines. As the hangar bay doors opened to the vastness of space, she couldn't help but smile. The Lightspeed Frontier had thrown her another curveball, but as always, she was ready for the challenge.\n\nThe scout ship shot out of the freighter, quickly accelerating to light speed. Behind her, the mega-freighter grew smaller, along with the corporate ambitions it represented. Ahead lay the unknown – new adventures, new dangers, and perhaps a few new allies.\n\nExia leaned back in the pilot's seat, already planning her next move. She may not have gotten her lifetime supply of cola, but she'd gained something far more valuable – her freedom, and a reminder that even in the vastness of space, unexpected connections could be forged.\n\nAs stars streaked by, Exia allowed herself a moment of reflection. The frontier was vast and full of perils, but it was also a place of endless possibility.

{"id": "text_completion_026", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: School had just begun and already Mr. Okada had lost Masaki's attention. Rather than copying down complex yet pointless math equations and functions, Masaki much preferred to daydream; he dreamt about being free from the oppressive constraints that society had put on him. He was always told to do well in school, to get into a good university and this would inevitably lead to a decent job as a salary man. Masaki couldn't care any less though. He wanted to simply enjoy life. The weather outside was strangely inviting. The sun was shining and there wasn't a cloud in sight. Masaki thought about jumping out of the third floor window and just escaping.\n\n\n\"Hey Kawada! Pay attention!\"\n\nMr. Okada, a math teacher of 16 years, had his methods of dealing with students like Masaki Kawada. Okada grabbed the piece of chalk that he was writing with, and with one swift motion hurled it towards Masaki's seat.\n\nBulls-eye.\n\n\"Ow.. ugh…\"\n\nThe piece of chalk hit directly in the center of Masaki's forehead and caused him to stumble and fall out of his chair. While on the wooden floor, confused at what just happened, Masaki looked around, his eyes meeting the eyes of each of his classmates; some were surprised, some were worried, other were holding back laughter.\n\n\"Is my class really that boring to you Mr. Kawada?\"\n\n\"Um.. yes sir.\"\n\nThe wrong answer.\n\nAnother piece of chalk was already flying through the air and it caught Masaki in the exact same spot where the first one had hit.\n\nThwack!\n\nRight as Masaki had regained his composure from being struck the first piece, he was sent back to the floor with another. And by this time the whole class was in laughter. It wasn't a surprise to anyone that Masaki had suffered. While Masaki Kawada is a relatively normal high school senior, he could be categorized as the class clown. Other than this mishap, the rest of the class period went relatively silently. Mr. Okada grabbed another piece of chalk from his seemingly endless boxes of chalk and resumed writing math equations on the board. Soon it was lunch break.\n\n\"Man…that Okada did not spare you an ounce of mercy today. It must have hurt\"\n\nShingo Kimura, Masaki's best friend grabbed his desk and merged it with Masaki's. Masaki normally ate lunch with Shingo and another friend, Kana Aizawa, but it seemed that she had something important to do at this time. \"I don't even understand how he throws the chalks so well. I'm more astounded by the fact that he can hit me from that far away!\"\n\n\"He must have had lots of practice.\"\n\n\"I mean, he gets his daily practice on you even now.\"\n\n\"Shut up, there are plenty of other students not paying attention. He just hates me or something. I'll be right back. I'm going to buy some juice\"\n\nMasaki walked out of his classroom and towards the vending machines. There were 3 lined up at the end of the hallway, each containing different variety of drinks.\n\n\"I think I'll get some green tea today.\"\n\nMasaki took out a 100 yen coin from his pocket, and inserted it into the machine, then proceeded to press the button for the bottled green tea.\n\nNo response.\n\n\"Damn… you have got to be kidding me.\"\n\n\"Let me give it a try.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nWhile Masaki was cursing the vending machine for eating his 100 yen coin, a girl that he had never seen before showed up. She was not wearing the school's uniform, so maybe a transfer student? She had a small slender frame and long straight jet black hair. There was an aura of class about her, and yet, she was giving the vending machine a series of roundhouse kicks.\n\n\"Hey! What are you doing?!?\"\n\n\"I am assisting you with the machine.\"\n\n\"And I'm telling you, there is nothing that can be done about it.\n\n\"Just one more try.\"\n\nIt was probably illegal to physically abuse the vending machine like that, but with one last swift kick to the side of the machine this girl had made it spit out at least 20 drinks. There were cans of various drinks rolling around on the floor. Not one can was green tea.\n\n'Just my luck'\n\n\"I'm pretty sure, it's broken now.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThe girl was nowhere to be seen. 'Maybe she slipped out after destroying school property not wanting to get in trouble, but she didn't even go to this school right? Wait, then if so, what was she doing here in the first place?'\n\nMasaki's mind was clouded by these questions. He picked up all the cans and made his way back to classroom 3-A. He arranged the drinks into a pyramid of cans on top of his desk as he asked random classmates to take them as they wanted.\n\n\"Why did you get so many drinks?\" Shingo asked.\n\n\"I didn't on purpose. The machine ate my money and this random girl showed up from nowhere and beat the machine half to death.\"\n\n\"Like hell I'll believe that.\"\n\n\"Why would I lie about something so outrageous?\"\n\nThere is no way anyone would believe such a ridiculous story, but Masaki did not have a reason to lie. So after that Masaki insisted that he was not lying, Shingo decided to believe in his friend.\n\n\"So do you know this girl?\" Shingo continued.\n\n\"Not a clue about who she is, she wasn't wearing our school uniform, so I wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"Was she attractive?\" At this point Shingo was just trying to pry.\n\n\"I didn't see her that well.\"\n\nThat was a lie. Masaki had seen this girl's face and still remembered it well. She resembled a doll, a seemingly harmless, but vicious doll. Remembering the vending machine, Masaki shuddered in his seat and sipped on his coffee drink that left a bitter taste in his mouth. A few hours later, school was over. Shingo, an avid member of the kendo club, ran over to the practice dojo located on the west side of the school building. Masaki, after school usually helps out at his family's cafe, Au Lait. A lot of students stop by afterschool, so it was always busy for Masaki.\n\n\"I'm home\"\n\n\"Welcome back, how was school?\"\n\nA woman stood in the entrance way of the store-front of a café. Inori Kawada, is the mother of Masaki Kawada. While 38 years old, she still looks like she was in her twenties. The local women would frequently ask her for beauty tips. \"It was fine.\"\n\n\"Masaki, did the shipment of Earl Grey leaves come in today?\" Remembering that he had received a package early in the morning and had done preparatory work before going to school, Masaki replied,\n\n\"Yeah, I sorted them into the usual tins and they should be on the middle shelf. Just give me a minute to put on my work clothes\"\n\nMasaki stepped into the back and started to change into his work clothing. Dress shirt, a vest, and a bow-tie. He felt like he was dressing like a butler, but it was a familiar feeling.\n\nThe shop had an interior décor that resembled something that you would find in France. Polished wooden floorboards on the ground, a rather dim lighting, and warm brown colors painted the walls. Ding-Ding-Ding, the bell rang as the customers began rolling in. \"Hello, may I show you to your seat?\" Masaki would ask as he showed the customers his best business smile. \"Please take a look at our menu, might I recommend for today Chamomile tea with crème caramel?\" Masaki usually recommended this combination as it was his two favorite relaxation menu items. The aromatic Chamomile tea always took away the stresses of school away and the savory sweet flavor of the crème caramel was delectable.\n\nAfter hours, Masaki would lie in bed and wonder about if there was anything more to life than his current circumstance. While he did the things that he had to do, he grew tired as the monotony of daily life took its toll. Masaki needed something else.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Continuing the story:\n\nAs Masaki lay in bed, his mind drifted back to the mysterious girl who had kicked the vending machine. Her sudden appearance and disappearance intrigued him, providing a brief respite from his mundane routine. He couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to her than met the eye.\n\nThe next morning, Masaki trudged to school, his feet heavy with the weight of his discontent. As he approached the school gates, he noticed a commotion. A crowd had gathered around the bulletin board, buzzing with excitement.\n\n\"Did you see? There's a new transfer student!\"\n\n\"I heard she's from overseas!\"\n\nMasaki's ears perked up. Could it be the girl from yesterday? He pushed through the crowd to get a better look at the announcement. There, printed in bold letters, was the name \"Yuki Tanaka.\"\n\nAs he entered the classroom, Mr. Okada was already at the front, looking unusually flustered. \"Class, settle down. We have a new student joining us today.\"\n\nThe door slid open, and in walked the girl from the vending machine incident. Masaki's eyes widened in recognition. She stood at the front of the class, her posture perfect and her gaze unwavering.\n\n\"Please introduce yourself,\" Mr. Okada prompted.\n\n\"I'm Yuki Tanaka. I've just returned from studying abroad in France. Pleased to meet you all.\" Her voice was calm and measured, betraying no hint of the rebellious spirit Masaki had witnessed the day before.\n\nAs Yuki took her seat – conveniently located right next to Masaki – whispers erupted throughout the classroom. Masaki couldn't help but stare, trying to reconcile this poised student with the vending machine vandal.\n\nDuring lunch break, Shingo excitedly approached Masaki's desk. \"That's her, isn't it? The vending machine girl!\"\n\nMasaki nodded, still bewildered. \"I don't understand. She seems so... different.\"\n\nAs if on cue, Yuki appeared beside them. \"Masaki Kawada, right? I believe I owe you a green tea.\" She placed a bottle on his desk, a mischievous glint in her eye.\n\nMasaki stammered, \"Uh, thanks. But how did you...?\"\n\n\"I have my ways,\" Yuki replied cryptically. \"By the way, I hear you work at a café. Perhaps you could show me around town sometime? I'd love to try some local specialties.\"\n\nBefore Masaki could respond, Yuki had already turned and walked away, leaving him and Shingo slack-jawed.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Masaki found himself increasingly drawn into Yuki's orbit. She had a knack for shaking things up, whether it was challenging teachers' perspectives in class or organizing impromptu adventures after school. Masaki discovered a kindred spirit in her restlessness, her desire to break free from societal expectations.\n\nOne afternoon, as they sat in Au Lait sipping Chamomile tea, Yuki leaned in conspiratorially. \"You know, Masaki, there's more to life than this. I've seen it. Experienced it.\"\n\nMasaki raised an eyebrow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nYuki's eyes sparkled with excitement. \"In France, I learned that life is meant to be lived, not just endured. We don't have to follow the path everyone expects us to. We can create our own.\"\n\nHer words resonated deeply with Masaki, awakening something within him that had long been dormant. \"But how?\" he asked, both excited and apprehensive.\n\n\"It starts with small acts of rebellion,\" Yuki explained. \"Like kicking a vending machine when it eats your coin. Or...\" she paused dramatically, \"skipping class to explore the city.\"\n\nMasaki's heart raced at the suggestion. It was everything he had daydreamed about, but never had the courage to do. \"We could get in trouble,\" he said weakly, even as a part of him thrilled at the idea.\n\nYuki shrugged. \"That's part of the excitement, isn't it? Besides, some experiences are worth the risk.\"\n\nAs the days passed, Masaki found himself embarking on small adventures with Yuki. They would sneak out during lunch to try street food from hidden gems in the city, or take detours on the way home to explore abandoned buildings. Each escapade left Masaki feeling more alive, more in tune with himself and the world around him.\n\nHowever, these actions didn't go unnoticed. Mr. Okada began to eye Masaki with increasing suspicion, and his grades started to slip. His mother, too, noticed a change in his behavior at the café, where he seemed more distracted and less attentive to customers.\n\nOne evening, as Masaki lay in bed reflecting on the day's adventure – a thrilling parkour session across the city's rooftops – he felt a mixture of exhilaration and unease. He was experiencing life in a way he never had before, but at what cost? Was he jeopardizing his future for these fleeting moments of freedom?\n\nAs he drifted off to sleep, Masaki realized that his journey was far from over. He had tasted freedom, but now he faced a new challenge: finding a balance between his newfound zest for life and the responsibilities he couldn't entirely abandon.

The creature she stalked was still drowsy and moved in a slow, clumsy fashion. The moment came, and Mei took it. She pounced out of the alleyway, running towards the man. The bakery owner looked up and was surprised to see a young teenage girl standing close by. Her puppy dog eyes fixed on him.\n\nHe had just started opening his shop and was putting his bread outside to sell. Mei's eyes moved from his face to the bread in his hand. He moved it a few times, watching her eyes follow it with extreme accuracy.\n\nHe sighed loudly, knowing he was beat. He handed over the piece of bread and was rewarded with a large smile. The corners of his own mouth turned up in a smile as he watched Mei disappear into the alley.\n\nUnfortunately, she ran right into a small ambush. Three men, all looking down on their luck, stood there waiting for her. The boss, a man that towered over the other two, held out his hand for the bread. \"Street tax,\" he said. One of his followers, giggled nervously.\n\nThey thought Mei would be easy pickings. She was a twelve year old, Chinese girl, very petite. She barely reached the boss' large stomach. Her clothing was in the Chinese fashion, with a tight top with loose, flowing arms and loose pants, all in a greenish-grey colour. Her bright red shoes, looking something like slippers were the only real colour on her. Her long black hair was tied up tightly on her her head and was covered by a newsboy cap. To these tough men of New York city, there seemed nothing to be scared of.\n\nShe put the bread between her teeth, holding on to it, for safe-keeping. The man leered down at her, cracking his knuckles to emphasize his point. Between the crack of his first knuckle and his second, Mei had made her move. She reached down to the ground, going into a handstand with her legs in the air. She then pushed off from the ground hard. The soles of her shoes found the bottom of the man's chin. His expression barely changed, as he fell to the ground, unconscious.\n\nThe man's two friends looked at each other in disbelief. That had to have been an accident. They nodded to each other, working up the courage to test her. As they moved to surround her, Mei regained her feet. In a fluid motion, she punched with her right fist and kicked with her left foot, hitting both men squarely in the stomach at the same time. They both doubled over, feeling sick. Mei stood as tall as she could, still only about as high as the men crouching over in pain, and glared strongly at the both of them. The effect of the glare was somewhat lessened by the large piece of bread held between her teeth. It did its job, however, and the men ran off, leaving their boss lying on the ground.\n\nMei sat down on the unconscious form of her would-be attacker. There was a slight chill in the air and he was a warm seat. She stared out at the city through the small opening of the alley. It was still early. A few store owners had started their opening exercises, but it was too soon for the customers to come out. The few others that stood around were those that were universally known as loungers. They did not have enough money to buy anything, but sitting at home was too boring, so they simply walked the streets, aimlessly.\n\nAimless wandering was one of the most popular activities of the day. Mei had forgotten the exact date long ago, but it was sometime in the 1930's. The Great Depression was in full swing. Many people did not have jobs, and they had given up looking for one some time ago. So, they simply wandered. It eased the hunger pains in their stomachs, and the pains of pride in their hearts for being jobless and unable to provide for their loved ones.\n\nMei did not blame the man that was now temporarily her warm seat. The Depression had caused many to turn to desperate acts that they would have shied away from in happier times. He was hungry, she was hungry, and there was only enough food for one. Living had lost its pleasures and was now a test for survival.\n\nWhile those around her had been forced into this life, Mei, however, had actually chosen it. She could not imagine the people of her tiny village being affected by something so trivial as a world-wide depression. And it was only because she had left, that she now faced the harsh life of the streets.\n\nShe was searching for her older brother, Li. One night, he had simply disappeared. The village's treasure, a jade dragon sculpture, had vanished along with him. She would never believe the liars that said he had stolen it.\n\nIt had been a little over two years since she had left. She had searched most of China for a sign of him, and had finally arrived in Hong Kong. Her talents for fighting allowed her to survive life on the city streets, but she heard nothing of her missing brother. That was when something miraculous happened to point her in the right direction.\n\nRunning down the streets, being chased by bullies much larger than the ones she'd just dealt with, Mei found a small alley to hide in. The bullies passed her by. But just as Mei was about to breathe out a sigh of relief, a small flash of green light, the colour of jade, appeared against the far wall. The sigh caught in her throat. The light grew brighter and larger, much larger. After a moment, she could make out the image of her brother, completely green.\n\nMei reached out with a trembling hand. \"Brother?\"\n\nLi looked around, as if he were lost. \"America,\" he said, haltingly. His voice seemed to come from a far off distance, even with him standing right in front of her. \"You must go to America.\"\n\nWith that, Li simply disappeared. The green light in the alley was snuffed out completely. Mei sat down on the cold ground and cried.\n\nThe next day, she made up her mind to travel the long distance to America. She had snuck aboard a merchant ship, and hid inside the cargo hold. She lived off scraps that she could steal from the crew. The rats took the blame for her tiny feasts.\n\nAnd now, here she was in New York, still fighting, still begging for food, and still without a clue to her brother's whereabouts. The warm bread started to taste a little salty from a couple tears that she couldn't keep back. Two years of world traveling felt like an eternity for the young girl.\n\nA flash of green interrupted her thoughts, before the waterworks really began. It was there! Something incredibly large, the same green colour her brother had appeared as, streaked quickly past the alley she sat in. Mei jumped off the man, leaving the last portions of the bread beside him and took off running.\n\nAs soon as she left the alley, Mei realized she was not chasing her brother. It was the Jade Dragon come to life, only infinitely larger. Lifesize, she supposed, but she had no idea what scale a lifesize dragon would actually be. Instead of regular flight, it seemed to twist itself through the air and clouds, like a gigantic snake slithering along the ground. Every twist, every movement was so full of beauty, though.\n\nMei kept it within sight as she chased after its tail. Though there was very few people out at this time, she wondered how a dragon the size of a football field could create so little attention. Everyone just went about their business, completely ignoring the flying monster. If anything, it was Mei herself, that gained the most attention, with people jumping out of her way or yelling at her to stop running so fast. She had always been a polite girl, at least decently so, but she just ran straight through them.\n\nFinally, after turning a corner, she came face to face with the dragon. It had come to a halt, and now the magnificent green monster looked down at her. It seemed still, yet its body moved constantly, keeping it airborne. There was a sense of sadness in its majesty. Mei could do nothing but stand there with her mouth open. And, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the great dragon vanished in a rush of air.\n\nBut this wasn't all. Loose papers that were lying around were blown up with the rushing air. They swirled around Mei until she reached out and grabbed one. It seemed like a poster advertising a detective agency.\n\nIn bright, bold lettering, it read, \"Spooks, spectres, ancient curses? Are you having trouble with magic? Come see the Magic Detective.\"\n\nMei was shocked. \"This can't be a coincidence.\" No sooner than saying that, she looked around and saw the same poster everywhere. It was plastered on walls, on benches, under the wipers of cars, literally everywhere. A little doubt crept into Mei's last statement. \"Or, maybe it is.\"\n\nA little while later, on the other side of town, Mei reached the address of the so-called Magic Detective. The exterior did little to stir the imagination. It was a squat, brown brick building. It was the kind of place where the architect must have given up on ever creating real beauty and had settled on practicality. It was not ugly, just dull.\n\nWith her paper flyer in hand, Mei approached the front door. She was an incredibly brave girl, but she could not hold back a slight shaking in her limbs as she knocked. She had not found many people she could trust in her travels, and this magic business sounded a little sketchy. There was no answer. She tried again, with the same result.\n\nIgnoring her desire to leave, and her temper rising with being ignored, she tried the handle. This was a success and she took her first step inside. She entered into a hallway, long and narrow. \"Hello…?\" She asked the empty air, a little tremulously. Gathering her courage, she walked forward and reached a door. Without even bothering to knock, she opened this one.\n\nIt was like looking at a disaster zone. Papers and books and who knows what else covered the floor creating a miniaturized landscape of hills and valleys. A large table stood along the back wall covered in metal and chemical experiments. Two small birds, one yellow, the other blue, flew around the room, as if they were looking for a way to escape. There was a window, but it was half-covered by stacks of books. The only source of light came from a large fireplace in the corner. The coals inside burned low, but still seemed a danger in this room of loose paper and books.\n\nThe place filled Mei with a sense of horror. She turned to go, but something long and warm shot out of the pile of trash and grabbed onto her ankle, holding her there. Mei froze. She wanted to run but her body had gone numb with shock. Her brain was left screaming while her body moved slower than ever before. It took her over ten seconds to finally turn her head enough to look down at her leg. It was a hand! She saw a long arm reaching out from the refuse, and now it was slowly pulling her back in.\n\nMei reacted instinctively. She grabbed the largest object at hand, a massive book, and brought it down hard on the monster hidden in the papers.\n\n\"Ow!\" was the only response she got. The hand recoiled and out of the papers a young boy stood up. He was a curious sight. Mei felt he was probably about thirteen years old, though he could have been younger, as he was short and very, very thin. He was dressed in decent clothes, a shirt and tie, and suspenders help up his wool pants. But everything was worn in a sloppy manner. The tie was slightly crooked, the shirt needed a good ironing, and one of the straps of his suspenders had fallen off his shoulder. This sloppiness was emphasized all the more as he was now vigorously rubbing his sore head, messing up his tousled brown hair even further.\n\n\"Do you always hit people when you visit them?\" he asked.\n\nMei blushed deeply. \"I didn't mean to. You grabbed me.\"\n\nThe boy waved his hand, as if he no longer was interested in the subject. He tapped his index finger against his pursed lips as he stared intensely, and without a shade of embarrassment, at his guest. Mei was definitely feeling uncomfortable under his scrutiny. It was if she was some kind of interesting bug on the slide of a microscope.\n\n\"Hmmm…\" he said, after a few moments. \"You're from northern China, but you've spent some time in Hong Kong, and only recently made it here. You're an athlete, or some kind of fighter. And, you've got a problem with magic.\"\n\nMei was shocked. \"How did you know all that?\"\n\nThe boy yawned, as if he'd just woken up from a nap. He brushed together a pile of the surrounding papers and sat on them like a stool. \"I can tell by the muscles in your arms and legs - it's not that hard to notice them through your clothes - that you must be extremely athletic. The fact that your Chinese is obvious, and Chinese boxing or Kung Fu has become famous in the last while. Wasn't that difficult. Your clothes are all styled in the Hong Kong fashion, so it made sense that you've spent a long time there. The length of time is obvious by the age of your clothes. They've seen better days. That's also how I could tell you've been living on the streets.\"\n\nMei blushed a bright scarlet. She looked down at the worn-out knees in her trousers and the loose threads at the end of her sleeves. She made a movement to try to hide some of the worst aspects of her clothes. She stopped herself quickly, however. Her blushing face took on a look of intense pride. She held herself up stiffly and glared at the boy, almost daring him to find more faults with her. The boy did not seem to notice, as he continued on with his assessment.\n\n\"Of course, I realized that I was wrong in thinking that you were from Hong Kong as soon as I saw your necklace. It's obviously from northern China. It's been taken good care of, more than anything else you own, so it has sentimental value. Not that hard of a guess that it's from your homeland. And as to you needing help, well...\" The boy suddenly grinned widely. \"Hello, my name is Tobi. If you're here looking for me, then you definitely need some help.\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm looking for you?\"\n\nHe pointed to her hand. \"You're holding one of my flyers.\"\n\nMei's eyes opened wide as she looked down at her hand. \"Oh! Of course.\"\n\nTobi sat himself more comfortably on the pile of papers he had made into a temporary chair. He reached into a pocket and pulled out a small chocolate wrapped in colourful paper. He unwrapped it, threw the paper behind him to join with the other scattered trash, and placed the chocolate into his mouth. A dreamy look of pleasure came over his face as he slowly chewed and swallowed the small piece of candy.\n\nThat look of pleasure only slightly decreased as he looked his guest over again. \"So,\" he said finally. \"What brings a girl from northern China to Hong Kong and then all the way to my humble home?\"\n\nMei had seemed entranced by the spectacle of Tobi eating the chocolate, but she shook herself awake now. She looked again at the waist-high piles of paper, at the dirty shelves and the busted birdcage. There was nothing in sight that gave her the slightest confidence in this strange little boy. Her problem was not a normal one, and the visions she had were definitely unnatural. There was no way that someone like this boy could help her.\n\n\"I think I've made a mistake,\" she said as she turned to go. \"I'm sorry for wasting your time.\"\n\n\"It's do with magic, isn't it? Your problem, that is.\"\n\nMei turned back quickly to face him. \"Only some of us thought the dragon was magic.\"\n\nThere was something strange in his smile. If Mei had not turned and looked at him, she would have left then and there. That smile, though, it was so full of it's own genius, so confident that it was always right about everything. That smile irritated her. It also made her feel like she should trust this boy to help her.\n\n\"Come with me,\" he said, quietly, as he stood up. \"I want to show you something.\"\n\nTobi took Mei's hand and led her further into the room. She stumbled over several piles of old papers. When she looked up, they were standing in front of the large fireplace.\n\n\"Where are you taking me?\"\n\n\"Into the fire,\" answered Tobi. His tone was simple, but it still felt ominous. As if on cue, the low burning fire burst into life. The flames towered over the two children. Tobi grasped Mei's hand even tighter, almost crushing it. He stepped towards the roaring fire, pulling her with him.\n\n\"No!\" she cried, but it was too late. The two of them fell forwards, into the flames.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story:\n\nMAGIC DETECTIVES by Michael Way (Twitter: mikel_way)\n\nEPISODE 1: A GIRL FROM CHINA Part 2\n\nMei expected to feel the searing heat of the flames, but instead, she felt a cool rush of air. Her eyes, which she had squeezed shut in anticipation of pain, slowly opened. She gasped as she took in her surroundings.\n\nThey were no longer in Tobi's cluttered office. Instead, they stood in a vast, circular room with high ceilings and walls lined with countless books. The floor beneath their feet was a mosaic of intricate patterns, swirling with colors that seemed to shift and change as they watched.\n\n\"Welcome,\" Tobi said with a grin, \"to the true office of the Magic Detective.\"\n\nMei's mouth hung open in astonishment. \"How... how is this possible?\"\n\nTobi shrugged, his earlier nonchalance returning. \"Magic, of course. That messy office? Just a front to keep away the non-believers and the merely curious.\"\n\nAs they walked further into the room, Mei noticed floating orbs of light drifting lazily through the air, illuminating the space with a soft, warm glow. In the center of the room stood a large, ornate desk covered in strange instruments and glowing crystals.\n\n\"Now,\" Tobi said, settling into a plush chair behind the desk, \"tell me about this dragon of yours.\"\n\nMei hesitated for a moment, still overwhelmed by her surroundings, but then launched into her story. She told Tobi about her brother's disappearance, the jade dragon sculpture, and her journey from China. When she described the vision of the giant jade dragon in New York, Tobi leaned forward, his eyes sparkling with interest.\n\n\"Fascinating,\" he murmured. \"A living jade dragon... I've heard whispers of such things, but never encountered one myself.\"\n\n\"Can you help me find my brother?\" Mei asked, hope rising in her chest for the first time in years.\n\nTobi tapped his chin thoughtfully. \"It won't be easy, but I believe we can. The dragon is clearly trying to lead you somewhere. We just need to figure out where and why.\"\n\nHe stood up and walked to one of the bookshelves, running his finger along the spines until he found what he was looking for. He pulled out a thick, leather-bound tome and brought it back to the desk.\n\n\"This is a compendium of magical creatures from around the world,\" he explained as he flipped through the pages. \"Ah, here we are. Jade dragons.\"\n\nMei leaned in to look at the intricate illustrations on the page. The dragon depicted looked remarkably similar to the one she had seen in New York.\n\n\"According to this,\" Tobi read aloud, \"jade dragons are ancient guardians of sacred places and powerful artifacts. They're known for their wisdom and their ability to traverse great distances in the blink of an eye.\"\n\n\"But what does that have to do with my brother?\" Mei asked, frustrated.\n\nTobi closed the book and looked at her seriously. \"I think your brother might have become entangled with something far more dangerous than just a stolen sculpture. The jade dragon might be trying to protect him... or warn us about something.\"\n\nMei's heart raced. Could her brother really be in that much danger?\n\nTobi stood up again, this time walking to a large globe in the corner of the room. He spun it with a flick of his wrist, and it began to glow with an otherworldly light.\n\n\"We need to track the dragon's movements,\" he explained. \"If we can figure out its pattern, we might be able to predict where it'll appear next.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and held his hands over the globe, muttering words in a language Mei didn't understand. The globe's glow intensified, and suddenly, green lines of light began to crisscross its surface.\n\n\"These are the dragon's flight paths,\" Tobi said, opening his eyes. \"Look, they all seem to be converging on one point.\"\n\nMei leaned in closer, her eyes widening as she recognized the location. \"That's... that's my village! In northern China!\"\n\nTobi nodded grimly. \"It seems the dragon is trying to lead us back to where it all began. We need to go there, Mei. It's the only way to find your brother and solve this mystery.\"\n\nMei felt a mix of excitement and fear. She had traveled so far, only to be led back home. But now, she wasn't alone. She had a friend, a magical detective no less, to help her.\n\n\"When do we leave?\" she asked, determination in her voice.\n\nTobi grinned, that same confident smile that had irritated and intrigued her earlier. \"Right now, of course. Adventure waits for no one!\"\n\nHe walked back to the fireplace, which had reappeared on one of the walls. With a wave of his hand, the flames turned a brilliant emerald green.\n\n\"After you,\" he said, gesturing to the fire.\n\nMei took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever lay ahead. She had come too far to turn back now. With one last look at Tobi, she stepped into the green flames, ready to face whatever magic and mystery awaited them in her homeland.\n\nAs the fire engulfed them both, Mei couldn't help but wonder what other secrets this strange boy detective held, and what dangers they might encounter on their journey. But for the first time in years, she felt hope. Hope that she would find her brother, and hope that she might finally unravel the mystery that had changed her life forever.\n\nThe green flames swirled around them, and in a flash, they were gone, leaving the magical office empty and silent, waiting for their return.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation largely maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text in terms of plot, character development, and tone.

{"id": "text_completion_028", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Hello! What's up? What is crackalackin? I never know how to start these things. Hell, I've never written anything of real substance before. I was just told by a few friends to start writing this. Whatever this is. See, I have a pretty strange job. That job being, I'm a librarian. That's not the strange part though. I work nightshift, as a librarian. Quite the kicker, huh? I've frequently scrolled through these forums and pages reading stories as I pass the time during my working hours, and naturally I stumbled here.\n\n\nThe job itself isn't all too bad, just very monotonous and tedious. Is that redundant? Maybe. So, a bit about my job. I sit behind a desk for a few hours, walk around a bit, come back, sit back down, and repeat. It may seem a lot worse than what it actually is..and you're right. You see, there are these little...I don't even know what to call them. I guess they are like a sugar glider? Lemur? Whatever the fuck Mort from Madagascar is? I don't know, I've only ever seen them a few times and even then, it was just for a second. To put it lightly, they like to fuck with my shit. Like I will be sitting here at my desk and I will be drawing. I would get up to make my rounds and I will come back and the drawing will be messed up! Just a bunch of incoherent scribbles and at the very bottom of the page, in the bottom right, what looks to be a signature. I would be impressed but they don't even do a good job. Not to mention, those FUCKERS always steal my pens.\n\nNow with any job, you will have your good and bad days. For example, I will have a really good night where nothing happens and my drawings won't get tampered with while I am making my rounds. On the other hand, I will come across a totally not inconspicuous wormhole in the science fiction section or a Yeti in the folklore section. I'm only joking about the wormhole part, that has only happened once here and that was right before this position opened funnily enough.\n\nI do think I have to elaborate on what \"doing my rounds\" entails. For the first round I make every night, I simply just put the books that have been returned where they need to be. The only other possibility is to clean up anything that has not been cleaned before closing which is very rare. My shift starts at 9:30PM and it is imperative that someone is here all night so it ends at 7:00AM. The library itself closes to the general public at 8:00PM. That gives the closers ample amounts of time to tidy up and leave notes for things that still need to be done once I am on shift. Right after I complete my first walkthrough of the library, I unlock the front doors so that the not-so-general public may peruse our selection. More on that later. For the next few hours, I spend my time doodling, writing, or helping out those who come into the library. Every so often, I will leave my desk and walk through the library just to check on things really.\n\nThere's never really been anything too bad to happen here. Just a few dead bodies, shady figures standing outside at all hours of the night, those aforementioned lemur shits, and a small bible\"s worth of other things. I plan on expanding what I already have written as time goes on, seeing as how I have essentially nothing but time and absolutely zero fucking pens OR pencils if I may so graciously add. Like okay, the least they could do is leave a quarter. Hell, I'd even take pennies at this point.\n\nNow, for the library itself. On the outside, it looks like any regular municipal library would look like. But on the inside, it gets a little more interesting. Once you walk through two sets of glass doors, you are greeted with a Victorian esque interior. Shined oak floors stretch across the entire floor, the doorframes have those weird but aesthetically pleasing frames that you always see in this style of architecture, add onto that a dull green and gold pattern on the walls. If you for some reason decide to look up, you will see rafters and arguably nothing past that. A chandelier hangs over the desk I essentially live at, which might I add, is candle lit. Every source of light within the library is a candle. Which is quite odd. Hell, we have one guy come in at least once a week that bitches about it and insists we try out his new invention. I keep telling him that we are very highly considering it just so he won't shock me. He keeps asking me if I'm married and he always says, \"I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.\" Truthfully, I can't name many inventions to begin with. Much less with that kind of criteria.\n\nNow, on to my desk. Imagine the desk that the president sits at, or even the one the queen would sit at. Now, make it larger. A lot larger. That is the desk I want. The desk I have; however, is like a mini version of both of those desks. I quite like it though. Numerous drawers line my work space, which is where I keep my writing utensils...if I fucking had any left. I also keep paper, both loose-leaf and regular documentation papers around for various library tasks. Other than that, I have two candles on either side of me for better lighting. There are a few small doors on the desk that I have no idea what they go to, and yes, they ARE doors. I checked. They have little hinges and doorknobs made out of brass. There is one located on either side of my desk at floor level. All of these marvelous and beautiful things, yet a cheap office chair from the nineties is what I get to sit on. It doesn\"t even have arm rests. Plus one of the wheels is broken so it doesn't even roll properly.\n\nAs for the book section...well it kind of depends on the section. Each section has only minor differences, yet those differences rely on the theme of the section. The similarities of each section lie in that all the bookcases follow the same oak wood build. Now for the differences. Say, for instance, you want to peruse the history section. The inlays for the wood be history related. For folklore, folklore related. See the pattern here? I find it all quite neat, until you get shot in the side of the head with a toothpick sized arrow by a Native American on horseback...little shits.\n\nThat thing is outside again. If anyone has ideas of what to do with it, please let me know. The shape of it is always different, but the same spot and same time mean the same thing. If something looks like a creepy bastard, feels like a creepy bastard, and probably smells like a creepy bastard...it is probably a creepy bastard. As for my writing utensil dilemma, where can I get pens and pencils for dirt cheap? It's getting ridiculous at this point.\n\nIt looks like a patron is coming in, I'll keep you guys posted. This guy is one of the ones we need to keep a general eye on while they are here...and he likes to stay awhile.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Alright, here's a continuation of the story:\n\nAs the patron walks in, I can't help but sigh. It's Mr. Creepy, as I've dubbed him in my head. He's a tall, lanky fellow with stringy gray hair and eyes that never seem to blink. He shuffles towards my desk, his worn leather shoes barely making a sound on the polished oak floor.\n\n\"Good evening,\" I say, trying to keep my voice neutral. \"How can I help you tonight?\"\n\nMr. Creepy's lips twitch into what I assume is supposed to be a smile. \"I'm looking for a very specific book,\" he whispers, his voice raspy and dry. \"It's called 'The Whispers of the Void.' Have you heard of it?\"\n\nI suppress a shudder. Of course, I've heard of it. It's one of those books that shouldn't exist, but somehow does in our library. \"I'll need to check our special collection,\" I tell him. \"Please wait here.\"\n\nAs I stand up, I notice one of those lemur-like creatures darting behind a bookshelf. Great, just what I need right now. I make my way to the back of the library, to a section hidden behind a velvet curtain. The air here feels different, heavier somehow. I scan the shelves until I find the book Mr. Creepy wants. It's bound in what looks like human skin, and I swear I can hear faint whispers emanating from it.\n\nWhen I return to my desk, Mr. Creepy's eyes light up at the sight of the book. \"Ah, excellent,\" he says, reaching for it.\n\n\"Sir,\" I say firmly, \"you know the rules. This book can only be read within the library, and you must wear the protective gloves.\" I pull out a pair of thick, rune-inscribed gloves from a drawer.\n\nHe nods reluctantly and puts them on before taking the book. As he walks away to find a secluded corner to read, I notice a trail of what looks like ash following his footsteps. Great, another mess I'll have to clean up later.\n\nJust then, I hear a commotion from the folklore section. I hurry over to find a group of tiny leprechauns having a heated argument with a rather annoyed-looking unicorn. Yes, you read that right. A unicorn. It's not the weirdest thing I've seen in this library, trust me.\n\n\"Gentlemen, please,\" I say, trying to keep my voice low. \"This is a library. If you can't keep it down, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\"\n\nThe leprechauns grumble but quiet down. The unicorn gives me a grateful nod before returning to its book on advanced calculus. Don't ask me why a unicorn is interested in math; I've learned not to question these things.\n\nAs I'm heading back to my desk, I notice one of those little doors on the side of it is slightly ajar. Curious, I bend down to take a closer look. To my surprise, I see a tiny office inside, complete with a miniature desk, chair, and even a little computer. Sitting at the desk is one of those lemur creatures, wearing a tiny pair of glasses and typing away furiously.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I say, not quite believing what I'm seeing. \"Are you... working?\"\n\nThe creature looks up at me, clearly annoyed at being interrupted. It hands me a minuscule piece of paper. I squint to read it: \"Official Library Assistant - Night Shift.\"\n\nWell, that explains where all my pens have been going. I'm about to ask for them back when I hear a loud crash from the science fiction section. With a sigh, I close the tiny door and head off to investigate. Just another night at the world's strangest library.\n\nAs I round the corner to the sci-fi section, I'm greeted by the sight of a swirling vortex of energy where the \"Black Holes and Other Cosmic Phenomena\" shelf used to be. Standing in front of it, looking rather sheepish, is our resident mad scientist, Dr. Quantum.\n\n\"I can explain,\" he says quickly, his wild hair even more disheveled than usual. \"I was just testing out my new portable wormhole generator, and well... it works!\"\n\nI pinch the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache coming on. \"Dr. Quantum, we've talked about this. No experiments in the library, remember?\"\n\nHe nods vigorously. \"Yes, yes, of course. I'll close it right away.\" He fiddles with a device on his wrist, and the vortex slowly shrinks until it disappears with a small 'pop'. Unfortunately, it also seems to have taken half of our sci-fi collection with it.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Dr. Quantum says, noticing my expression. \"I'm sure they'll turn up... somewhere. Probably in the 25th century, but still.\"\n\nI make a mental note to order replacements for the missing books. As I'm jotting this down, I realize I'm using a pen. An actual, working pen. I look at it closely and notice tiny teeth marks on the cap. Seems like my new \"assistant\" has decided to share after all.\n\nThe rest of the night passes in a blur of bizarre events. I break up a heated debate between Shakespeare's ghost and a time-traveling English professor, help a werewolf find books on anger management, and politely decline an offer from a vampire to \"join the nightlife for real.\"\n\nAs dawn approaches, I begin the process of ushering out the night's patrons. Mr. Creepy is the last to leave, his eyes glowing faintly as he returns \"The Whispers of the Void.\" I make sure to sanitize the book and my hands thoroughly after he's gone.\n\nJust as I'm about to lock up, I notice that shape outside again. Tonight, it looks like a twisted amalgamation of shadows and mist. I've tried ignoring it, I've tried confronting it, I've even tried offering it a library card. Nothing seems to work.\n\nAs I turn the key in the lock, I hear a faint whisper from behind me. \"You're doing a good job, kid.\"\n\nI whirl around, but the library is empty. Well, as empty as this place ever gets. I smile to myself as I head home. Despite all the craziness, despite the danger and the weirdness and the constant theft of my writing utensils, I love this job. After all, where else could I possibly fit in?\n\nI make a mental note to buy more pens on my way to work tomorrow. Maybe this time, I'll get the ones with the really loud clicky tops. That'll teach those lemur things to steal from me. Probably. Maybe. Okay, probably not, but it's worth a shot.\n\nAs I step out into the early morning light, I can't help but wonder what the next night will bring. In this library, anything is possible.

{"id": "text_completion_029", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: \"WHY ME?!\" I sobbed as I clutched my belly.\n\n\nI was seven months pregnant and my life was in shambles. I was living in a run-down shack of a house that had no heat and it was well into the winter. There was no cable, only an antenna taped to the top of the television that only got signal for about four channels, wooden planks missing in the bathroom and bugs roaming all about the house. The mattress I slept on had sharp springs protruding in random spots that I could never seem to avoid. And to make it all worse, I had no transportation or a phone to call for someone to pick me up, because my boyfriend had taken both with him to work that morning.\n\nI slowly rubbed my belly and cried until my tears dried up, leaving me with nothing but burning eyes and a terrible headache.\n\nI knew I had to get out of this, but how? I never had the courage to leave although everything in me had been telling me to run from the very first time he hit me. But I stayed, I stayed and let the abuse continue. I let him alienate me from my family, the only people who have ever truly loved me. I let him steal all of my joy, for what? So I can stay with him and live this shitty life that no one wants? So I can live my life worrying about when the beatings will get worse or if he will do the same thing to our son later in life? I knew I needed to leave, but I also knew that there was still something holding me back.\n\nI lay back on the bed as carefully as I could and stared up at the ceiling, thinking about the night that started all of the darkness in my life:\n\n I had gotten into some trouble and decided to move back to Oklahoma with my mom and my sister, and I was even able to convince my mom to let me bring along my boyfriend, Eric, and my puppy. We had only been there for about a week when we were invited to my best friend Carly\"s birthday party.\n\n Everyone was having a great time, drinking, dancing and laughing. After a while, the party had wound down, leaving only a small group of us that had all gone to high school together, Eric being the only outsider.\n\n We gathered in a circle and decided to play a game of Never Have I Ever, for \"old times sake\". Having known a good amount of dirt on everyone, we all began to sabotage each other. As my fingers began to drop as I silently admitted the things I\"d done, I noticed a shift in Eric\"s demeanor.\n\n \"Never have I ever had sex in the same room as someone else\", Carly snickered as we both locked eyes and dropped out last finger simultaneously.\n\n I stood up to go take a shot with her to commemorate our losing the game, when Eric tightly gripped my arm.\n\n \"Come outside real quick\", he said as he led me towards the front door.\n\n \"What\"s up?\", I say as I lean against my car to maintain my balance.\n\n \"Yo, what the fuck was that? You been out here bein\" a hoe or sum\"?\"\n\n \"What are you even talking about? That stupid game? Am I not allowed to have had a life before I met you?\"\n\n \"You were having sex in the same room as someone and -\"\n\n \"Okay, first of all, yes my BEST FRIEND and I DID have sex in the same room before but nowhere near each other. Second of all, we were both with our boyfriends. And FINALLY, how the fuck can you be mad about something that happened YEARS before I ever even met you?!\", I yelled.\n\n \"Man fuck this, I\"m ready to go\" he said as he made his way to the driver door.\n\n I text Carly and told her Eric was tripping so we were leaving and hopped in the passenger seat to head back home. We were almost back to my mom\"s house when he started belittling me.\n\n \"I should have just stayed with my first baby mama, at least she was better than you. She was neat, always had the clothes washed and the room clean. And she wasn\"t a fuckin\" hoe\", he muttered.\n\n \"I\"m sure you would have stayed with her if you could but you fucked that up, didn't you? If she wanted you, you wouldn\"t even be right here starting this shit with me and you would be able to know your daughterthat you\"ll never see!\"\n\n He turned left at the intersection, heading the opposite way from home. As we drove past my old high school he continued to say any and everything he could to get under my skin and hurt me. I couldn\"t take it anymore, I screamed and mushed the side of his head, knocking the earring out of his ear.\n\n Before I could say anything he punched me square in the face, then grabbed me by my hair, slamming my head into the dashboard multiple times. I held my face and cried as we pulled into the EzGO parking lot. I was hurt and furious that he would do something like that to me.\n\n I lashed out and fought back, only to be hit again, with more force this time. I turned to get out of the car and run into the gas station when he grabbed my arm and pulled me back into my seat. My eyes locked on a man parked next to us who had watched everything unfold, and he turned his head and started backing out to leave.\n\n I had no help.\n\n I swung at him with all of my strength, colliding my right fist into his jaw. He paused for a moment then took the cigarette out of his mouth and burned me in the center of my forehead. That was it, I had no more fight left. I was humiliated and left to suffer by the stranger beside me.\n\n My eyes welled with tears and I cried like I never had before. I felt defeated. He immediately began to apologize and promise that he would never hurt me again. We both cried the rest of the way back to my mom\"s house as he begged me not to tell anyone what happened.\n\nI slowly sat up and dried my face with the bottom of my t-shirt.\n\n\"I have to get out of this before I can\"t anymore\", I whispered to myself.\n\nI never understood why it was so hard for me to leave someone who was doing me so much harm. I can\"t say that I stayed for the love he made me feel, because I really didn\"t feel loved. I felt like a burden, like nothing I did would ever be good enough to make him stop treating me the way he did. And yet, when my family told me to leave him I found every excuse I could think of to stay with him.\n\nI spent more time blaming myself and wondering what I did to him to make him feel the way he did towards me than worrying about how the way he treated me made me feel. Putting his happiness before mine had become second nature to me, it no longer mattered how many nights I spent crying myself to sleep as long as I could get him to go a day without getting mad at me.\n\nI\"ve always heard that women who grow up without a father wind up having a lot of problems with men because of their need to fill the void of being loved by a man. I never fully believed that this was indeed a fact, however, looking back I can\"t help but find some truth in it. How could I not? I was the perfect example of a woman that spent her whole life without her father and then wound up having a ridiculous amount of issues when it comes to dating.\n\nYou see, to this day I still have no recollection of memories that I share with my biological father. All I know is that, he was married to my mother when I was born and was around for the first couple of years of my life, until my mother joined the Army to try and improve our lives, that is. He, of course, hadn\"t wanted her to join but he also was unwilling to be the man in the family and join himself to take care of his family. So instead of him just letting her join since she was willing, he decided to give her an ultimatum, it was either him or the Army. With my mother being the headstrong woman that she is, she chose the Army.\n\nWhat makes it worse though, is that my sister and I didn\"t leave Georgia right away when our mother did, we stayed with our grandmother while our mother was stationed in Korea. Why couldn\"t I have lived with my father while my mother was gone? He didn\"t have to give up on me too just because my mother joined the Army. He could have been there for me and maybe I would have a better standard to hold a man to instead of just trying to figure it all out on my own now.\n\nThe door swung open and jolted me out of my thoughts.\n\n\"Hey baby,\" Eric said as he leaned in to kiss me.\n\n\"Hey babe, how was work?\" I responded.\n\n\"You know, same shit different day. So we still going to your grandma\"s house?\" he said as he searched through a pile of clothes to find an outfit for the day. I never understood how he was so content with wearing his clothes multiple times before washing them. It was disgusting.\n\n\"Yeah, I need to wash my clothes. So, you know if you don\"t want to stay you can just drop me off and go chill with your brother or something,\" I said hoping he would go along with my suggestion. I needed some time with my family without him so I could feel comfortable being myself for a while. I was also starving and I already knew my grandmother didn\"t care for Eric and hated when I would make him a plate of anything she cooked. She told me over and over again that she didn\"t make the food for him, it was for her grandchildren, but if I wanted to eat I had to make him a plate too or I wouldn\"t hear the end of it so I always did it anyway.\n\n\"Aight, bet. That\"s what I wanted to do anyway. Go smoke and play the game for a lil bit while you chill wit yo peoples,\" he agreed.\n\nI smiled to myself as I searched through my bag for something I could still fit. It was time to start planning my escape..\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Here's a continuation of the story:\n\nAs I gathered my things to go to my grandmother's house, I felt a glimmer of hope for the first time in months. This was my chance to reconnect with my family and start planning my escape from Eric's abuse.\n\nDuring the car ride, I remained quiet, lost in thought about how I would approach my family. Eric seemed content with the silence, probably looking forward to his time away from me. When we arrived at my grandmother's house, I hesitated before getting out of the car.\n\n\"I'll call you when I'm ready to be picked up,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nEric nodded, \"Alright, just don't take too long. You know I don't like waiting.\"\n\nAs I watched him drive away, I took a deep breath and knocked on the door. My grandmother answered, her face lighting up when she saw me.\n\n\"Oh, sweetie! Come in, come in,\" she said, ushering me inside. \"Where's that boy of yours?\"\n\n\"He had some errands to run,\" I lied, not wanting to explain the real reason.\n\nMy grandmother's house felt warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the cold, run-down shack I'd been living in. The smell of her famous pot roast filled the air, making my stomach growl.\n\n\"Sit down, honey. I'll fix you a plate,\" she said, noticing my hunger.\n\nAs I ate, my grandmother sat across from me, her eyes filled with concern. \"How are you doing, really?\" she asked.\n\nI couldn't hold it in any longer. The tears started flowing, and I told her everything – the abuse, the isolation, and my fears for my unborn child. My grandmother listened patiently, her face a mix of anger and sadness.\n\n\"Oh, my sweet girl,\" she said, taking my hand. \"You don't have to go through this alone. We're here for you, always have been.\"\n\nOver the next few hours, we formulated a plan. My grandmother called my mother and sister, who rushed over to join us. Together, we decided that I would stay with my grandmother until I could get back on my feet. They promised to help me find a job, get proper prenatal care, and even offered to accompany me to file a restraining order against Eric.\n\nAs the day wore on, I felt a weight lifting off my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, I felt supported and loved. But I knew the hardest part was yet to come – confronting Eric and leaving him for good.\n\nWhen it was time for Eric to pick me up, my family huddled around me, giving me strength. My sister handed me a burner phone they had bought, so I could contact them without Eric knowing.\n\n\"Remember, we're just a call away,\" my mother said, hugging me tightly.\n\nAs Eric's car pulled up, I took a deep breath and stepped outside. This time, instead of getting in the car, I stood my ground.\n\n\"Eric, we need to talk,\" I said, my voice stronger than I expected.\n\nHe looked confused and annoyed. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"I'm not coming back with you. I'm staying here with my family,\" I declared.\n\nHis face contorted with anger. \"You can't do that! You're MY girl, and you're carrying MY baby!\"\n\n\"No, Eric. I'm my own person, and this baby deserves better than what you can offer,\" I said, my hand protectively on my belly.\n\nAs Eric started to get out of the car, my family emerged from the house, forming a protective circle around me. Seeing them, Eric hesitated.\n\n\"This isn't over,\" he growled, getting back in the car and speeding away.\n\nI knew it wouldn't be easy, but as I turned back to my family, I felt a surge of hope. For the first time in a long time, I believed that I could build a better life for myself and my child.\n\nThat night, as I lay in my old bedroom at my grandmother's house, I whispered to my unborn son, \"We're going to be okay.

{"id": "text_completion_030", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: *São Paulo, Brazil. 12 million people jammed in tiny flats. Construction companies have managed to flatten most of the old São Paulo, and build a bigger, uglier one on top of it\"s rubble. It\"s hard to find any old buildings, and the government is indifferent towards the hunger of the construction conglomerates. Sometimes you can spot an old house here and there.\n\n\nThis is the story of one of this houses.*\n\nI swallowed my pride and went into the room, ready to listen. Lino was draped over his chair: lord of his two-by-three, chipboard-walled castle. I closed the door, making the walls shudder.\n\nSitting opposite Lino was an old man in a dark blue concierge\"s suit. The man\"s small, dark, speckled eyes were fixed on Lino, waiting for the answer to a question I hadn\"t been there to hear. I took a seat next to him.\n\n\"We\"ve got the solution to your problem,\" Lino said.\n\nI nodded. Solutions were good. The old man next to me was still looking at Lino, as if they were alone in the room. Maybe he\"d had a brain haemorrhage. Maybe they were in love.\n\n\"And what problem are we talking about?\" I said.\n\n\"You know.\" Lino would\"ve put his feet up on the table if there\"d been space, but he settled for stretching like an old, effeminate cat. \"In Consolação.\"\n\nSo I was right, it was my neck on the line. I spoke carefully, as if talking to a retarded child holding an AR-15.\n\n\"Lino, you know I\"ve done everything I could. Mrs Pederneiras doesn\"t want to move. I know it\"s been four-\"\n\n\"Six.\"\n\n\"Six, fuck, six months, whatever.\" I unbuttoned my shirt collar. \"I just wanted to make it clear I\"ve done what I could.\"\n\nLino looked at the archive box on top of the shelves. That was where he kept the files on his employees. Had my time come? I mentally calculated the redundancy payout I\"d get. What with the child maintenance and the payments on the car, I reckoned I\"d have enough to live off for about four months. It would go further if I wasn\"t still paying for the apartment Viviane took from me.\n\nHe lost interest in the box and lifted a pen to his mouth, chewing the end for what seemed like an age.\n\n\"This should be the city of the future, of enterprise, of tomorrow. It\"s Brazil\"s engine,\" Lino said, clamping the end of the pen between his teeth. \"Who cares about knocking down a little house in Brazil\"s engine?\" He held the pen up, emphasising his own words and showing his teeth. \"It\"s Brazil steamroller.\"\n\nI\"d forgotten about the old man next to me. He turned his head towards me, becoming aware of my presence for the first time.\n\n\"As Mr Lino said, we\"ve got the solution to your problem,\" said the old man.\n\nA hippie necklace was just visible underneath the old man\"s beige casual shirt. Little coloured stones on a thin thread. Where had I seen that before?\n\n\"You\"re going to demolish the house by mistake,\" the old man went on.\n\nLino smiled so wide I thought the skin stretched over his cheeks would split like a ripe tomato.\n\n\"You\"re going to take the guys there and demolish the house,\" said Lino, twisting the end of the pen between his fingers. \"When the police arrive, if they arrive, you say it was a mistake. It won\"t be your responsibility, it\"ll be the company\"s.\"\n\n\"And what about Mrs Pederneiras?\"\n\n\"She\"ll probably sue the company and get 300,000 in insurance out of us.\"\n\n\"The house is worth at least three times that.\"\n\n\"It\"s enough for an old woman.\"\n\n\"We\"ll get royally fucked in court, Lino.\"\n\n\"No we won\"t. I spoke to the judge about it at Cláudia\"s birthday last week. We\"re on the same page.\"\n\nMy gaze darted around the room. Such a brilliant and cruel idea could only be conceived in a construction company. I focused on the yellow plastic box.\n\nLino tapped the pen hard against the table, but not out of nerves.\n\n\"I\"m not going to do that,\" I said.\n\nLino raised the pen once more. His eyes lazily scanned the room until they came to rest on the yellow archive box that also held my attention.\n\n\"Mrs Pederneiras doesn\"t go out,\" I said.\n\nThe old man turned his chair. \"She\"s going out tonight. A family emergency. She\"ll be back tomorrow.\"\n\n\"She has family?\"\n\nThe old man turned his chair back to face Lino.\n\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" I said.\n\n\"Someone who wants all this to be over with.\"\n\nFor fuck\"s sake.\n\nPaulista was gridlocked. I took São Carlos do Pinhal, ignoring the roadsigns, I cut down Augusta, got onto Consolação.\n\nFor fuck\"s sake.\n\nI got out of the car in front of the plot of land. An enormous rectangle of kidney coloured ground, with a lonely little house halfway along the block. All of the surrounding neighbourhood had already been sold to the construction company and demolished, with considerable compensation. All except Mrs Pederneiras\"s house. I walked up to it, dirtying my khaki trousers with earth.\n\nIt was just another house with no personality or architectural value, like almost all the houses in São Paulo. A functional two-story block built for eating, eating, shitting. Lino was right, who cared about that piece of crap?\n\nI knocked because the bell didn\"t work. Mrs Pederneiras dragged herself to the door.\n\nShe was a pale old woman with eyes almost entirely hidden by the bags around them. Her hair was still dark and straight. She must have been getting on for ninety, a hundred. And even though she knew why I was there, she greeted me with a smile.\n\nJust like all the other times I\"d been to the house, she led me to the living room crammed full with trinkets, pictures, various worthless bits of rubbish. A whole life in odds and ends. We sat in the armchairs in the centre of the round sisal rug.\n\nI spoke unhurriedly. We talked about the weather, the traffic, the elections. It always took at least ten minutes of small talk before I could bring up any important issue with her. I\"m terrible at small talk, but with her didn\"t mind. We eventually ran out of inoffensive topics.\n\n\"Have you thought about the construction company\"s offer?\"\n\nMrs Pederneiras smiled an old woman\"s smile.\n\n\"How many times have you asked me that already?\"\n\n\"Three hundred,\" I replied, a reasonable approximation.\n\n\"And what have I always told you?\"\n\nShe watched me with the sincere superiority of someone who will not be moved. Or pushed. Mrs Pederneiras had held out for almost a year, even when they knocked down everything around her, when they left the motors running all night for a week on purpose, when the mortal remains of her ex-neighbourhood were carted off, covering her house with red dust for weeks. The old woman was a brick wall. No, not a wall. Lino could knock down a wall.\n\n\"You agree that we\"re in a stalemate here, don\"t you? The thing is that all this, this whole problem, is falling on my shoulders.\"\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n\"I understand that you don\"t want to move. Really I do. This is your home. But it\"s already been decided, by power\"s greater than you, you and I are nothing in this process, you know, we\"re tiny ants. We can kick and shout all we like and we\"ll still just be insects. The construction company is going to trample on us all the same.\" I brought my thumb and index finger together, squashing an invisible being: \"Tiny ants.\"\n\nAnd she sat there, smiling.\n\n\"I\"m pleading with you,\" I said, taking her bony hands in mine. \" I need this job,\" I whispered without meaning to.\n\nIt was true. Mrs Pederneiras left her hands there and fixed her eyes on me for a long moment.\n\n\"This might be the last time I come here, do you see? The construction company is losing patience.\"\n\nThe old woman fiddled with something at her neck. She looked around and tensed her arms, which were still muscular for her age and reminded me of the bricklayers I worked with every day. She checked the top button of her shirt. She adjusted her still-dark hair. She was getting ready to say something difficult.\n\n\"This is the first time you\"ve been honest with me.\"\n\n\"Don\"t talk like that, Mrs Pederneiras.\"\n\n\"So I\"m going to be honest with you.\"\n\nShe looked around the room, pensive. Then she dropped her gaze to the rug.\n\n\"This house mustn\"t move from here.\"\n\n\"The house?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The house mustn\"t move from here?\"\n\nThe old woman leant back in the chair, looking around her again.\n\n\"I look after the house. There has always been a house here.\"\n\n\"At this address?\"\n\n\"Since there have been people.\"\n\nI leant back in the chair, establishing a safe distance, as if senility was a dangerous gas leak that might blow my head apart at any moment.\n\n\"And you\"ve been here forever too?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nI got up.\n\n\"So this house, it\"s been here forever?\"\n\n\"Not this house. There were others before it. But there has always been a house, right here, on the spot. It\"s important that there\"s be a house here. Sit down.\"\n\nIt was an order, and I obeyed.\n\n\"My mother lived here. And her mother. When Isias Pederneiras arrived, he found a house already here. He was a bandeirante who crossed the Pacific with Manuel Preto. He killed everyone who lived here, except one. She showed him the importance of the house. And the two of them stayed there. There has been a house here ever since and there has always been somebody guarding the house. When my time is up, my son will take my place. And his son. And so on.\"\n\n\"And you can\"t leave here?\"\n\n\"I don\"t even know if it\"s possible. The house wouldn\"t allow it. The house has a purpose, and it can be dangerous when it needs to be.\"\n\nWould I end up like that as well? Alone and senile, still paying this ridiculous maintenance and hated by my daughter? I was unable to say anything else. It was too sad.\n\nThe old woman got up. She signalled for me to do the same and I obeyed. She walked to the corner of the room, bent over until her waist was at a right angle and effortlessly pulled back the edge of the round carpet, toppling two cane-seated chairs.\n\nIn a corner of the wooden floor there was a small round hole the size of a fist.\n\nMrs Pederneiras pointed at the hole.\n\n\"There\"s something down there. Something bad. It\"s as cunning as anything and is always trying to get out. The house has to be here to stop it getting out.\"\n\nIf Mrs Pederneiras had gone mad, we could get a legal impediment. I might be able to serve as witness. I needed to talk to Lino.\n\n\"Look,\" she said.\n\n\"In the hole?\"\n\n\"In the hole.\"\n\n\"There\"s no need, I believe you, honestly.\"\n\nShe stood still, her arm outstretched with a belligerent index finger pointing towards the small orifice in the floor.\n\nI looked at the hole. It was very dark. A current of air came up through it together with the smell of dry leaves, strong spices, animal fat.\n\n\"I can\"t see anything.\"\n\n\"Closer.\"\n\nI took a step towards the hole.\n\n\"Closer.\"\n\nI don\"t know why I knelt down. I moved my head towards the hole and a damp breeze rose to meet me. How deep was it? I still couldn\"t see anything.\n\nThen, the sound: nails scratching against concrete. I jumped back.\n\n\"Fuck, rats make that noise, it\"s full of rats down there, holy shit!\"\n\nI apologised for swearing, surely looking like a naughty little boy. The old woman had stopped smiling. She walked to the door and held it open, waiting for me to leave, with her chin pointing towards the street.\n\n\"Go on. You can tell your bosses.\"\n\nI righted the chairs. They were hardwood, heavy.\n\nBefore closing the door, she grabbed my sleeve.\n\n\"Things around here grow without ever questioning what there was before. And other things are in their places for a reason. Not everything is transitory like your people want it to be. Some things should never change. The house stays here. And I stay with the house.\"\n\nThe top button of the old woman\"s shirt had come undone and around her wrinkled neck I saw a string of coloured stones. It was the second time that day I\"d seen a necklace like that. And thinking carefully about it, it was the second time I\"d seen those small dark eyes.\n\nThe old woman did up her button and closed the door.\n\nI called the foreman and made sure everyone was on the alert. The team knew what was going to happen that night. A few trustworthy men, who weren\"t going to spill the beans if the law decided to muscle in.\n\nI waited on the other side of the road in my double cab Ranger, ready to demolish the memories of a senile old woman so as to keep my job and meet the payments on the car.\n\nAt least the money had been well spent because the Ranger had everything, including tinted windows which meant the old man in his concierge\"s suit couldn\"t see me when he pulled up in a taxi and led the woman out of the house.\n\nMrs Pederneiras held onto the roof of the car before the old man guided her inside. She looked me straight in the eyes, hurt and disappointment coming in through the glass, her gaze meeting mine head-on.\n\nI was invisible behind the glass. Even so, I had to control my desire to hide under the seat. Poor old woman.\n\nThe man gripped her shoulders and deposited her in the back seat. I read his lips: \"Come on, Mum.\"\n\nThey drove away, leaving behind them a cloud of red dust. I went to find the team at the far side of the plot of land.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The foreman, Marcos, nodded at me, his face grim in the fading light. The excavator's engine rumbled to life, its massive arm poised to strike.\n\n\"You sure about this, boss?\" Marcos asked, his voice barely audible over the machinery.\n\nI hesitated, Mrs. Pederneiras' words echoing in my mind. \"Just... just wait a moment,\" I said, pulling out my phone.\n\nI dialed Lino's number, my fingers trembling slightly. He answered on the third ring.\n\n\"Is it done?\" he asked, not bothering with pleasantries.\n\n\"Lino, I... I think we should reconsider,\" I said, struggling to keep my voice steady.\n\n\"Reconsider?\" His tone sharpened. \"We've been over this. It's happening tonight.\"\n\nI took a deep breath. \"There's something about this house, Lino. Something... not right. Mrs. Pederneiras told me-\"\n\n\"I don't care what that old bat told you,\" Lino interrupted. \"Get it done, or you're finished. Understand?\"\n\nThe line went dead. I stared at the phone, then at the house. The windows seemed to stare back, dark and accusing.\n\n\"Boss?\" Marcos called. \"We waiting or what?\"\n\nI closed my eyes, took another deep breath, and nodded. \"Do it.\"\n\nThe excavator lurched forward, its metal arm swinging towards the house. As it connected with the wall, a deafening crack split the air. But it wasn't just the sound of breaking wood and plaster. It was something deeper, more primal.\n\nThe ground beneath our feet began to tremble. At first, I thought it was just the vibrations from the machinery. But then I saw the looks of panic on the workers' faces.\n\n\"Stop!\" I yelled, waving my arms. \"Everyone back!\"\n\nAs the excavator retreated, a fissure appeared in the ground, starting from where the house stood and spreading outward. The trembling intensified, and a low, rumbling growl seemed to emanate from the depths of the earth.\n\nWe watched in horror as the house began to sink, not collapsing inward as it should have, but being pulled down into the widening crevice. The smell that hit us was overwhelming – the same scent of spices and animal fat I'd noticed earlier, but a hundred times stronger.\n\nAnd then, emerging from the hole where the house had stood, we saw... something. It was dark, writhing, defying description. Tentacles, or perhaps roots, reached out, grasping at the air. Eyes – countless eyes – blinked open, focusing on us with malevolent intelligence.\n\nScreams erupted around me as the workers fled. I stood frozen, unable to comprehend what I was seeing. The thing – whatever it was – continued to rise, filling the space where the house had been and then some.\n\nIn that moment, I understood. Mrs. Pederneiras hadn't been senile or crazy. She'd been a guardian, keeping this... abomination contained. And we'd just set it free.\n\nMy phone rang, startling me out of my paralysis. It was Lino.\n\n\"Is it done?\" he asked again.\n\nI watched as the creature continued to emerge, its mass now towering over the surrounding area. In the distance, I could hear sirens.\n\n\"Oh, it's done alright,\" I said, my voice hollow. \"But Lino, I don't think any of us are going to like what comes next.\"\n\nAs I hung up, I caught a glimpse of movement from the corner of my eye. There, at the edge of the construction site, stood Mrs. Pederneiras and the old man in the concierge suit. They weren't running or panicking. Instead, they wore expressions of grim determination.\n\nMrs. Pederneiras met my gaze and shook her head sadly. Then she and the old man began walking towards the creature, their necklaces of colored stones glowing with an otherworldly light.\n\nAs chaos erupted around me – police cars arriving, people screaming, the creature continuing to grow – I realized that São Paulo's relentless march towards the future had just collided with something ancient and terrible. And in our greed and shortsightedness, we'd unleashed a force that might just bring the city of tomorrow crashing down around us.\n\nI looked down at my hands, remembering how I'd pleaded with Mrs. Pederneiras earlier. \"Tiny ants,\" I muttered, finally understanding the true weight of those words. As sirens wailed and the ground continued to shake, I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_031", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: I no longer can handle this house that I once called home. The plain white walls with the judgmental eyes. They have long since made me feel quite uncomfortable. My ears ache with such pain from the loud squeaky floor boards. I have yet to decide if they are begging me for help or screaming at me to leave. The shredded green carpet, upstairs in the last bedroom at the end of the hall, to the left, must truly despise me. I say this because when I walk into that room the carpets dark, green hands always wrap around my feet causing me to fall. I am afraid to take simple baths in the once peaceful tub, in the upstairs bathroom. Every time I get into the water and scooch down in it to get comfortable and relax, the water comes back on once I rest my eyes. I always feel the hands of someone trying to drown me. My only friend was the wall size mirror in my living room. It has the most welcoming presence and the most beautiful blue frame. I use to be able to look into it and see myself, the positive and happy self I use to be before…before all of this. Now it too has since betrayed me. It portrays me as this crazy, delusional person my family says I am. They say I am losing my mind but I am not. They say I am just the most, clumsy person they have ever met and that is why I trip over the carpet all the time. They even have an explanation for the bathtub. They say I fall asleep once I get too comfortable and that is why I feel like I am drowning. If only they could see the warning on the back of the front wooden door, just below the diamond shaped window. How they miss it I will never know. The blood is everywhere.\n\n\nMy name is Stephanie Grey. The year is 1997 and I am twenty-five years old. I have been living in this house for almost two years now. Before I moved to the peaceful town of New Seal, I lived in a very busy city. I was a very successful psychologist. I had a husband for about three years. We started dating when I was seventeen years old. Basically we were together for about six years. We lived together for four of those years. By now I am sure you are wondering why I continue to speaking in pass tense when referring to my husband. Well that is because in 1995 Gerald passed away. He was in a head on collision with another car. They both crashed into a guard rail. Everyone died involved including the little girl that was with her mother in the other car. I was completely devastated about this for a long time. Had my husband and I not been arguing then none of it would have happened.\n\nI stopped showing up to work and eventually lost my job. I didn't even care. After living with such depression for almost five months, I decided in order to be happy again I needed to move on. I knew the only way that I would be able to do this is, that I would have to move out of the house that I shared with my late husband. I didn't want to let go of the house I lived in for over four years but I knew I must be strong. That is how I ended up in this house that I have now.\n\nI found this house in a catalog. The description they gave was \"a beautiful, three bedroom, one and half bathrooms, a large front and backyard and two car garage. A great house for a large family looking for a peaceful and safe place to live.\" Now I know it doesn't make much sense for one person to move into a house so big. What caught my attention most about this house was that it was the only one that had the words \"peaceful and safe\" in its description. The thought of that sounded so wonderful to me and I figured if nothing else I could have a lot of sleep overs. Maybe even rent out the rooms to people and make some extra money, since I lost my job. I called the number listed for the home and moved in about two and a half weeks later.\n\nThe house was exactly as they said it was for the first year. The fresh air and the children playing in the street, brought more smiles to my face than I could count. I through parties often for my family and friends. I would invite the new people I had met since moving to this town. It was great and before I knew it I was back to how I once was. Although I missed my husband more than anything because he was my best friend, I was no longer sad. I have finally moved on and felt like I could be happy again. At least that is what I thought, till things started changing and the house became unfriendly.\n\nIt started out small, little things that had to happen several times before I even noticed them happening. My family always told me I was oblivious to the obvious. I figured out that, that is the only thing they have ever accused me of and they were right. Never have I ever met someone who doesn't notice when their chairs were rearranged or that their kitchen garbage was moved about three feet to the left and angled differently than they put it. I figured I simply forgot that I moved them and that was it. It didn't occur to me that something strange was happening until I started seeing the figures walking in the halls. I could never get a good enough look at them though, so I eventually started to dismiss them too.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Continuing the story:\n\nAs the days passed, the occurrences in the house became more frequent and unsettling. I started to question my sanity, wondering if the stress of losing Gerald had finally caught up with me. The figures in the hallways became more distinct, their shadowy forms lingering longer each time I caught a glimpse of them.\n\nOne particularly chilling night, I woke up to the sound of whispers coming from the green-carpeted bedroom. Gathering my courage, I crept down the hallway, my heart pounding in my chest. As I approached the room, the whispers grew louder, more urgent. I pushed open the door, and for a split second, I saw them – translucent forms huddled in the corner, their eyes wide with fear. They vanished as quickly as they appeared, leaving me trembling and doubting my own senses.\n\nI began to research the history of the house, hoping to find some explanation for the strange occurrences. What I discovered chilled me to the bone. The house had a dark past, one that the real estate catalog had conveniently omitted. In 1972, a family of five had been brutally murdered in this very home. The case had never been solved, and locals spoke of it in hushed tones, if at all.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the house's history, the paranormal activity intensified. Objects would move on their own, doors would slam shut, and the temperature would drop dramatically in certain rooms. The mirror in the living room, once my sole comfort, now showed me horrifying visions of the past – glimpses of the family's final moments, their terror etched on their faces.\n\nI tried to reach out to my family and friends, but they dismissed my concerns, attributing my experiences to grief and an overactive imagination. Their disbelief only served to isolate me further, pushing me deeper into the house's malevolent embrace.\n\nOne night, as I lay in bed, paralyzed with fear, I heard footsteps approaching my room. The door creaked open, and I felt a presence enter. Cold, clammy hands gripped my ankles, slowly dragging me out of bed. I screamed, but no sound came out. As I was pulled across the floor, I caught sight of the warning on the back of the front door – the blood-red message I had mentioned earlier. It read: \"Leave while you still can.\"\n\nIn that moment, I realized the house wasn't just haunted – it was alive, feeding off the fear and suffering of its inhabitants. The murders in 1972 had awakened something dark and hungry, and now it wanted me.\n\nWith newfound determination, I decided to fight back. I reached out to a local paranormal investigator, despite my family's protests. Together, we began to unravel the house's secrets, performing cleansing rituals and attempting to communicate with the spirits trapped within its walls.\n\nAs we delved deeper into the mystery, we discovered that the house's malevolent energy was tied to an ancient artifact hidden somewhere on the property. The family that had been murdered had unknowingly brought it with them when they moved in, unleashing its power.\n\nNow, as I write this, I'm preparing for one final confrontation with the evil that dwells in this house. I've learned that the only way to end this nightmare is to find and destroy the artifact. My name is Stephanie Grey, and I'm no longer the broken woman who moved here seeking peace. I'm a survivor, determined to reclaim my life and put an end to the horrors that have plagued this house for far too long.\n\nIf you're reading this, know that appearances can be deceiving.

{"id": "text_completion_032", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Mystery\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Only Sam and I know where Orson is.\n\n\nOnly Sam believes where Orson is.\n\nI talked with him, yes. I don't know how I managed to at last. Refusing or accepting wasn't going to work without that I assume, I remember that. It hadn't for a while now. I think about nine months. That's a bit odd to say… I also should mention I don't know if I will continue speaking with him like you suggested. Instead of that advice, I am taking the writing one again, about… about the why and the where, about where Orson is and what happened to him before all that and of course my feelings, for the same purpose of talking with Sam, which I think you'll appreciate. We'll see how it'll turn out…\n\n\n\nOrson gave me the 8 shaped necklace before he told me about the Osiris program. I was too worried about the idea of the baby being born an eight month like the doctor had said. Especially when the baby had pieced together the last unfixed pieces of our marriage. It was starting to affect my sleep, so, of course his too. He gave me the necklace after that. He said there was nothing we could do and it was time that was going to decide what was going to happen, and so that the only way we would be okay was that if we embraced it instead of refusing what was happening. And also after the 8 months he would give me another gift he promised. Like a charm, it worked. I put the 8 on my neck right then and didn't take it off whenever I did whatever. It's still on my neck, you probably seen it many times. After that, I asked him if he embraced it too. He confirmed it and I proposed we get him one too then. He declined on the account that there was no need. His way of showing how he was embracing it was different. That's when he told me he had accepted to go to the Osiris program.\n\nI wasn't happy with it but I couldn't blame him. This was a part of his character I had accepted, after I had scarred him with the way I was which had led to the divorce, which was cancelled thanks to him, in the cost of a slight change of his character. Some kids decide to do his jobs because it's so interesting and meticulous, his reason was to get away from home. He became that way after the cancellation of the divorce. As far as possible.\n\nHe went to the first Osiris Program with Sam who had already signed up for the second. It was the first Osiris route in their department, meaning they were the firsts which was pumping me up full of angst but before he went, he told me it'd be alright. He told me it was just another exploration mission around a station that was placed in Osiris. That was the idea which was giving me hope. Only after hearing it was just an exploration program I managed to cling on to that hope that everything would be fine when he came back. And explorations were never long, this one was assumed to be exactly seven months which was convenient for us.\n\nYou could imagine my surprise, or whatever word there is for what I was, when he returned thirty-two months later. It was seven months in Osiris time, not Earth... The mission wasn't just an exploration. It was an exploration of a time dilation source in Osiris.\n\nYou could also imagine his surprise when he saw his wife with more wrinkles, a few more health issues and a straight stomach. And also the baby room which was on a course to returning back to an office room. Selling the crib had taken me a lot of time and effort. It was a lazy and a slow course, but by his return it definitely looked more like an office than a baby room.\n\nThat's how and when his time perception issues had started. Also the green room incidents.\n\n\n\nI'd refuse the fact that I was not sleeping anymore. I was thinking that in any moment I could go to sleep, so I didn't get out of bed. But, now I'll say that was only because I wasn't accepting that my Orson was having issues. Again, now I can say that if you are going to refuse, you have to accept first… That's how those days were going and that's how I realized he wasn't sleeping, was out of the bed. Me refusing the fact that I wasn't sleeping meant I was staring at the ceiling for hours. Didn't make a difference. One of those days I woke up and saw he wasn't there. Like you said, I was trying to give him some space, some time, and I did, for a week until I couldn't. He was doing it every single day. His situation was exacerbating and space and time wasn't really helping him. I failed accepting that, and also I was at the point where I was starting to put the blame on him for the way he was.\n\nMy desire was too tangible I guess so that I woke up at the middle of the night.\n\nI turned to the kitchen first, thinking he might be smoking or eating or whatever. He wasn't. There was a light coming from the baby's room. From the office rather. A green light. A weird feeling of refusal accompanied me on my walk there.\n\nThe first thing that captured my eye when I entered the room was the density. The whole room was swarmed with that dense green light. It took me a while to for some reason to understand that he had changed the bulb to green. And then only after a second or two I realized Orson was crouched and was leaning back to the side wall, just sitting there. In all honesty, it was one of the scariest moments of my life. The strength sapped away from my legs; my knees buckled. It was that day when I had thought that Orson was gone, MY Orson. I remember thinking what happened to MY Orson, as if the man I knew had gone somewhere. And I couldn't change that. It became a daily routine of mine from until that day to ask myself every time I saw him where Orson was. Still wonder it. Change is a scary thing. Time is a scary thing Jan.\n\nI asked him all kinds of questions, why had he changed the lightbulb to green like that, what he was doing, why he was doing it, and many more. He answered everything with the same answer, told me he was just \"passing the time\". Nothing else came out of his mouth that meant something different.\n\nNext four weeks were exactly the same. He'd wake up at night, go to the green room. Sit there. I never saw him in the bed when I woke up in all of that time period. After numerous fights on the verge of getting physical, I quit chasing him to there, I didn't know what to do. I was just watching the time drift by, not anything else. I woke up, wondered where Orson was. Not the one in the green room, my Orson. That was it.\n\nThen, in the first of the month, one morning he was. In bed I mean. Wasn't sleeping. I woke up and he was up sitting on the feet end, his back turned to me. You know when you'd somehow know something was going on even when you were asleep? That's what woke me up that day. I woke up, I saw him sitting like that and I knew something was going to take a turn for the worst somehow. I called for him and he replied right away. Said he wanted to try again…\n\n\n\nNow, as you know, I didn't want that. I never wanted that. But I never got to fully explain my reasoning to you.\n\nUntil that day he was refusing everything, he had even suggested moving… It was feeling like everything was the same, and everything was a part of that; a bland blurry unity of something. It didn't change the issue at hand. The problem we talked about for me was the same for him back then. It was a clear-cut quandary between acceptance and refusal. And I was still wearing the 8. But his totem of acceptance was long outdated; he was back from Osiris, and he needed a new one.\n\nI couldn't deter him. He refused. He refused accepting the situation. And he was asking for a new totem for refusing; a new baby.\n\nWell… I didn't know what to make of it. I had felt like MY Orson was really, really gone and this man was trying to be there instead of him. It was as if he was trying to fill a shell of our old life with the current one.\n\nLooking back, I don't want to get on his throat like I wanted to back then, especially when I think about the old me and what I did. I am not judging him, not just judging... Perhaps this is me trying to handle my end. Or just trying to figure out where my Orson is.\n\nShe scratched her chest, underneath where the 8 is. Until it got red, then swapped the scratch with a sting feeling.\n\n\n\nThen we got into it. For hours, days, weeks. Fights, long silences that extended to hours, crying -all me, curses and demeaning remarks all over. I did everything in my power to revert his ask, his need but he didn't back down. It wasn't a conscious attempt; he was like that. Silent, immutable. Beat me into being the same way after a while...\n\nAfter our clash became a stillness conflict, he was showing signs of distress and trauma again. That's when I told him with the last ounce of character I had left. The only way to move forward was that if we accepted our situation. And only time had the say on what was going to happen. He only agreed on the second part. He kept insisting we try again.\n\nThis went on for a while like I said.\n\nAfter hitting brick walls we moved onto more direct points. He was becoming less eloquent at these points in axiomatic fashion which was really disturbing me, I became aware of the situation enough to pull some of my punches. Even though I was clear on the fact that I didn't want to try again.\n\nSo I told him. I told him that a new supply of hope could be destructive for us. Things might go the same way again and we might not be able to accept it this time.\n\nTo this he only said the thing. Just time alone is fabricated hope. What we will have is real hope.\n\nHe explained why he said this for about three hours that day. The most he had talked.\n\nHis main point was time. And I know this wasn't supposed to mean anything to me. Time was the reason he was sick you said, I know that. But his points remained solid in my head. He said just time was fabricated hope. Was it not? We were not doing anything except leaning back onto time, hoping someday it was all going to fix itself, as if it was time's job to fix things. Everything would persist to be the same if nothing changed. And time -time changing- for us, that wasn't enough change after that point. Once something happens like this, you forget everything you know. Or worse, you quit believing in them. All that intrigues you becomes what you don't know, so, you lean on time and what its unending stretch will bring to you. You squeeze hope into what you don't know. You fabricate hope in mystery, uncertainty, blank. Because what you know denies hope.\n\nI think about that a lot. Since he is gone, I think about it a lot, even more than I did back then. And back then, it made me think \"will this bring my Orson back?\" This was becoming visible for him I suppose, because he told me he didn't want to affect my decision to that much a degree. He went to Sam for a few days that week, which I didn't care about at the time. I knew it was partly because of my fits too… Well, that's what it all did for me, affected my thinking even more. Just time is fabricated hope, I couldn't think much about else.\n\nHe returned a few days later. We tried again. I thought of my Orson.\n\nTime wasn't slowed down for the first time that night after a month of stillness. The night wasn't frozen and the other side of the bed wasn't cold, as if frozen too. There wasn't a green light on the hall. And those were the days when we were only arguing about the decision. I thought to myself it would bring my Orson back if we decided to refuse what had happened to us, refused the stillness of time and the hope and the pointless drifting in it. I thought nothing changes if nothing changes. The very morning of the night we tried again, we went to the doctor to see. Doctor said I was pregnant. The very night of that morning was when the night I woke up and saw the green light seeping onto the corridor again.\n\nThat's was the day I signed in to see you Jan, alone.\n\nI felt the time's fabric changing when I stepped toward the green room. It slowed down with heaviness, smothered the brain with its rotted smell of sense.\n\nI saw him sleeping on the carpet in the room and stepped in as the frantic rage controlled me. A ravenous scream to the man I didn't know, the man that was supposed to be MY Orson but wasn't, spit itself out my mouth. I yelled at him, I was mad at him as if he knew where my Orson was, as if he was a messenger to him. \"Why the hell are you here again?\" Because he was there instead of Orson…\n\nHe said he was having trouble sleeping near me. Now I think it was because of the baby. The reason I think that is connected to the time he wanted to go to the Osiris. We've had a talk about why he was wanting to go, before the divorce risks had surfaced. About the real reason he wanted to go.\n\nEssentially, he was nervous about the baby's birth. More than me. This was gradually transforming into an actual issue back at the time, he was having trouble maintaining his composure. On top of this, he was wanting to go for a program for a while, I think this was due to our violent disagreements and also the prior talks of having a baby way before we decided. I suppose I gave him enough excuse by doing some things I don't want to mention, he told me that he thought it was a good idea to go. I didn't view that as irresponsible, uncaring or anything of the sort. In fact, I thought it was responsible in a concurrently hateful way, since I had accepted his character to be that, the kind that avoided problems, but he was doing something to palliate it. Yes.\n\nSo, that's another reason he went to the Osiris Program while we were expecting. And to come back to the reason why he was sleeping on the green room instead of sleeping with me in the bed is that I believe he wasn't dealing with the stress of the coming baby. That's just who he is, that's what I'll say now. Some husbands watch sports to relieve themselves, to have comfort, some of them do sports, a few work and few buy shiny things for their wives. He prefers to put distance between him and the problem, move away as much as he can to move on. This is the first reason I believe for his decision to sleep in the green room. The second one is in the rest of his answer to my question that night.\n\nHe went on with his answer. That was another odd one to listen to. He told me that it reminded him of his time in Osiris. There was not much stuff on the room, it was virtually empty, also green. So, he told me that it gave him some comfort, it relaxed him, freed him you know? It made me mad again. I didn't understand it at the time. I didn't yell the second time though, just asked him what was in that room that he valued so much, explained that I couldn't understand it. Obviously it was about the baby. The first one. That's not how he said it of course.\n\n\"Time\" he said. \"There is time in there. Free, quiet and aging time… It helps me sleep…\"\n\nStill bothers me. Bothers me more actually when I think about what it means. I now know that I didn't get what he meant when he said that back then. Still, I understood it enough to get that his situation was becoming worse. It was sufficient to realize that he was viewing my pregnancy as if it was for the first baby. As if I was going to give birth to the baby that we have lost…\n\nThis notion became clearer and was confirmed when we began discussing the baby's name which he wanted to be Rhea. The name we had picked for the first baby.\n\nJust like before, I thought of it again. Maybe this will help me find my Orson I thought. Because briefly, the question about Orson's whereabouts seemed to have somewhat of an answer; the past.\n\nShe scratched the spot under her 8 necklace… The urge to scratch it kept accruing as her fingernails brushed back and forth on it. She pressed the cold plate of the necklace on the itch with significant force for a momentary relief, enough force for the 8 to leave a mark on the skin.\n\nHer gaze reeled in on the mark, then fixated on it as it started unhurriedly waning. The red fading away, leaving behind small spots of contact indications that were eventually going to fade away too. She continued staring at the spot for a while.\n\nI didn't know what to do with that. It was a scary thing to process. Something a normal people wouldn't say or think or offer. Besides, nothing was to change in my opinion. I wasn't viewing the issue in the same manner. No one should have. I refused the old name. Back at me he came of course, he didn't accept the new one. Like that, we snowballed into a cycle of disagreements. In the back of my mind I was hopeful still, subordinate to the coming of the baby. My thinking was that the severeness of this situation of his would abate as the time flowed. My Orson would come back that way. The issue with that was some things did not do that.\n\nMy pregnancy signs were stalling.\n\nFor the first nine weeks, not one symptom, whether it was puking, morning sickness, cravings, back pain, bleeding or breast swelling was introduced to me. And these are mostly fifth week signs. The only ones that I had were fatigue and headaches, which nor me or Orson thought was strong enough evidence to connect to the pregnancy. We went to the doctor after these -I went. He was in the green room and I didn't want him to come anyway.\n\nThe doctor notified me that all seemed and late signs were somewhat common. I told all this to Orson but he couldn't make himself believe them. He hadn't told me this but it was evident by his mannerism and everything. And like the baby name situation, I was once again proved to be valid on my thoughts by the next milestone of his exacerbation; the nailing of the windows of the green room with wood planks and painting the room the old color.\n\nBy the time he was all into it, the only thing I managed to get out of him as for the reason was he said the need for using the green room in the morning as well.\n\nLike that, this person that was supposed to be my Orson was getting farther and farther away from that. His personality had already left the shell, his appearance was doing the same, going farther away from the first place, just like my Orson had. Where was my Orson, where was this guy going? Was he going to come back with the baby?\n\nThe rest of every question or attempt at conversing with him was returned to by nods, shakes of the head, blinks either for approval or saying no, and that sort of thing.\n\nShe paused for a moment. Something made her. Perhaps a thought or a feeling or an instinct.\n\nThe passing of time, it was the only thing taking place. The light kept illuminating the paper. The paper kept standing on the desk. Sound of the wind continued accompanying her. Small trickles of the rain remained trickling. The simple and uncomplicated realization accommodated her mind. It was all this that made her pause, in the middle of a thought she was putting to words. She rested her ears at the sounds, and her gaze at the sights contemplatively.\n\nI thought to myself those days that when the baby came, there'd be no reason for us not to move on. Every day there opened an occasion fit for me to tell this to myself. I tried many times to tell it to him too but to no avail of course. Things continued as we waited for the baby. There was not a single beam of light entering the green room from the outside. There was not a single time when he joined me in the bed. The weeks slowed again. I felt as though I was being pulled and pushed constantly to the past -along with him- to the moment when we got the news of the first baby. The bad news. The first eleven weeks passed like this, slow and heavy.\n\nThen I finally started puking. Puked. Wanted strange good. Nausea too. Things were so off the rails; Orson was so off the rails that I was not expecting any of the good reactions once I had from him to my signs. Rightly so; he doubled the boards on the green room to fully shut the light. This said light was maybe merely enough to unveil some dust in the air… Then he started building a cradle, didn't move the office desk though. I protested but then he would stutter and sometimes hit his head with his palm, he would say he was sorry, he would try to kiss me to apologize but it would be a weird, blank and debt kind of a kiss you know? And he wasn't doing all this in panic mode or anything. That made it all the more difficult to bear it. He seemed like Orson but wasn't. Then he bought clocks. More clocks. For the wall and both his wrists. He bought more bulbs, green ones of course. These things dragged on until my puking stopped, my cravings grew, and in general my pregnancy advanced. He bought more bulbs, more clocks, more boards.\n\nThose didn't stop… Every other week I woke up and the green light seeping into the corridor would be denser and more obvious as the baby came closer. I would literally hear the ticking of the clocks from the hall. Sometimes along with the sound of a hammer hitting boards. Or maybe the paint brushing the same-colored walls.\n\nAt the first day of the eighth month, he was at his strangest. The number of the clocks and green bulbs and the painting was at their highest. He was too energetic and too anxious. I remember finding it strange that he was trying to stay out of the green room that day. He'd mostly fail and jump back in and come out for a few minutes, rub my stomach and go back in with an apology. He literally did that for the whole day with random intervals. I heard him crying at the green room from the bed at night. And when I woke up in the morning, there was no green light spilling into the hall. He was gone.\n\nThat's it…\n\n\n\nSo, I talked to you. I talked to Sam. I talked to myself.\n\nI didn't really talk to Sam actually, Sam talked to me. I got his letter few months earlier.\n\nIn his letter, he mentioned how Orson had gone to see him in August. That was the 8th month of the pregnancy. He mentioned how Orson had asked him whether he was handling the PTSD about the time difference adaptation, and how Orson looked like he wasn't. He mentioned he looked off, unstable, worrying that day. He said but everything is well, he is with me. We'll have some time off. He'll be better after a few years.\n\nI mentioned that Sam had signed up for the second route.\n\nThat's it.\n\nSo, where is Orson?\n\nI know it. Sam knows it. Better than both of us, time knows it.\n\nShe scratched her chest once again before taking the 8 necklace out. Her gaze fixated on the 8. Puking, nausea, cravings related to things more important than food, headaches… She rotated the eight sideways. A longer stare continued itself on the sideways eight. For a long, stretched, slow burning nine seconds, which she hadn't intended for.\n\nShe recounted what he said in the voice message he had sent her before the day he arrived\n\n\"We, uh, we went into the station and there uh… It was in there.\"\n\nShe stared at him\n\n\"It was all green. It was moving and contorting, and spilling. And flowing.\"\n\nShe continued staring in bewilderment.\n\n\"It was time in there. I could feel it moving, alive. I felt it on my skin and my vision, my hair and my eyelashes and my breath. It touched and pierced everything in it. I could feel it flowing, and growing and shrinking at the same time. It was moving. And I was getting older, faster than normal. I could feel it, I felt it. It was hard to track it, impossible maybe actually. Yes. Time moved faster in there, in that green room.\"\n\n\"And if it wasn't for that place, I don't know how I could endure being away from you for such a long time. But it felt like only a couple of days to me.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Mystery.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a mystery story in the style of the reference:\n\nOnly I know where Evelyn is.\n\nI talked with the detective, yes. I don't know how I managed to at last. Refusing or accepting wasn't going to work without that I assume, I remember that. It hadn't for a while now. I think about six months. That's a bit odd to say… I also should mention I don't know if I will continue speaking with him like you suggested. Instead of that advice, I am taking the writing one again, about… about the why and the where, about where Evelyn is and what happened to her before all that and of course my feelings, for the same purpose of talking with the detective, which I think you'll appreciate. We'll see how it'll turn out…\n\nEvelyn gave me the hourglass before she told me about the Chronos project. I was too worried about the idea of time slipping away like the doctor had said. Especially when time had pieced together the last unfixed pieces of our relationship. It was starting to affect my sleep, so, of course hers too. She gave me the hourglass after that. She said there was nothing we could do and it was time that was going to decide what was going to happen, and so that the only way we would be okay was that if we embraced it instead of refusing what was happening. And also after the sands ran out she would give me another gift she promised. Like a charm, it worked. I put the hourglass on my desk right then and didn't take it off whenever I did whatever. It's still on my desk, you probably seen it many times. After that, I asked her if she embraced it too. She confirmed it and I proposed we get her one too then. She declined on the account that there was no need. Her way of showing how she was embracing it was different. That's when she told me she had accepted to go to the Chronos project.\n\nI wasn't happy with it but I couldn't blame her. This was a part of her character I had accepted, after I had scarred her with the way I was which had led to the separation, which was cancelled thanks to her, in the cost of a slight change of her character. Some scientists decide to do her jobs because it's so interesting and meticulous, her reason was to get away from home. She became that way after the cancellation of the separation. As far as possible.\n\nShe went to the first Chronos Project with Dr. Marlowe who had already signed up for the second. It was the first Chronos route in their department, meaning they were the firsts which was pumping me up full of angst but before she went, she told me it'd be alright. She told me it was just another research mission around a facility that was placed in Chronos. That was the idea which was giving me hope. Only after hearing it was just a research program I managed to cling on to that hope that everything would be fine when she came back. And research missions were never long, this one was assumed to be exactly three months which was convenient for us.\n\nYou could imagine my surprise, or whatever word there is for what I was, when she returned eighteen months later. It was three months in Chronos time, not Earth... The mission wasn't just research. It was research of a time dilation source in Chronos.\n\nYou could also imagine her surprise when she saw her husband with more gray hair, a few more health issues and a changed demeanor. And also the study which was on a course to returning back to a normal room. Selling the equipment had taken me a lot of time and effort. It was a lazy and a slow course, but by her return it definitely looked more like a bedroom than a study.\n\nThat's how and when her time perception issues had started. Also the blue room incidents.\n\nI'd refuse the fact that I was not sleeping anymore. I was thinking that in any moment I could go to sleep, so I didn't get out of bed. But, now I'll say that was only because I wasn't accepting that my Evelyn was having issues. Again, now I can say that if you are going to refuse, you have to accept first… That's how those days were going and that's how I realized she wasn't sleeping, was out of the bed. Me refusing the fact that I wasn't sleeping meant I was staring at the ceiling for hours. Didn't make a difference. One of those days I woke up and saw she wasn't there. Like you said, I was trying to give her some space, some time, and I did, for a week until I couldn't. She was doing it every single day. Her situation was exacerbating and space and time wasn't really helping her. I failed accepting that, and also I was at the point where I was starting to put the blame on her for the way she was.\n\nMy desire was too tangible I guess so that I woke up at the middle of the night.\n\nI turned to the kitchen first, thinking she might be drinking tea or reading or whatever. She wasn't. There was a light coming from the study. From the bedroom rather. A blue light. A weird feeling of refusal accompanied me on my walk there.\n\nThe first thing that captured my eye when I entered the room was the density. The whole room was swarmed with that dense blue light. It took me a while to for some reason to understand that she had changed the bulb to blue. And then only after a second or two I realized Evelyn was crouched and was leaning back to the side wall, just sitting there. In all honesty, it was one of the scariest moments of my life. The strength sapped away from my legs; my knees buckled. It was that day when I had thought that Evelyn was gone, MY Evelyn. I remember thinking what happened to MY Evelyn, as if the woman I knew had gone somewhere. And I couldn't change that. It became a daily routine of mine from until that day to ask myself every time I saw her where Evelyn was. Still wonder it. Change is a scary thing. Time is a scary thing Jan.\n\nI asked her all kinds of questions, why had she changed the lightbulb to blue like that, what she was doing, why she was doing it, and many more. She answered everything with the same answer, told me she was just \"observing time\". Nothing else came out of her mouth that meant something different.\n\nNext four weeks were exactly the same. She'd wake up at night, go to the blue room. Sit there. I never saw her in the bed when I woke up in all of that time period. After numerous fights on the verge of getting physical, I quit chasing her to there, I didn't know what to do. I was just watching the time drift by, not anything else. I woke up, wondered where Evelyn was. Not the one in the blue room, my Evelyn. That was it.\n\nThen, in the first of the month, one morning she was. In bed I mean. Wasn't sleeping. I woke up and she was up sitting on the feet end, her back turned to me. You know when you'd somehow know something was going on even when you were asleep? That's what woke me up that day. I woke up, I saw her sitting like that and I knew something was going to take a turn for the worst somehow. I called for her and she replied right away. Said she wanted to go back…\n\nNow, as you know, I didn't want that. I never wanted that. But I never got to fully explain my reasoning to you.\n\nUntil that day she was refusing everything, she had even suggested moving… It was feeling like everything was the same, and everything was a part of that; a bland blurry unity of something. It didn't change the issue at hand. The problem we talked about for me was the same for her back then. It was a clear-cut quandary between acceptance and refusal. And I was still keeping the hourglass. But her totem of acceptance was long outdated; she was back from Chronos, and she needed a new one.\n\nI couldn't deter her. She refused. She refused accepting the situation. And she was asking for a new totem for refusing; a new mission.\n\nWell… I didn't know what to make of it. I had felt like MY Evelyn was really, really gone and this woman was trying to be there instead of her. It was as if she was trying to fill a shell of our old life with the current one.\n\nLooking back, I don't want to get on her throat like I wanted to back then, especially when I think about the old me and what I did. I am not judging her, not just judging... Perhaps this is me trying to handle my end. Or just trying to figure out where my Evelyn is.\n\nHe touched the hourglass, feeling its cool surface beneath his fingers. Until it warmed up, then swapped the touch with a distant feeling.\n\nThen we got into it. For hours, days, weeks. Fights, long silences that extended to hours, crying -all me, curses and demeaning remarks all over. I did everything in my power to revert her ask, her need but she didn't back down. It wasn't a conscious attempt; she was like that. Silent, immutable. Beat me into being the same way after a while...\n\nAfter our clash became a stillness conflict, she was showing signs of distress and trauma again. That's when I told her with the last ounce of character I had left. The only way to move forward was that if we accepted our situation. And only time had the say on what was going to happen. She only agreed on the second part. She kept insisting we try again.\n\nThis went on for a while like I said.\n\nAfter hitting brick walls we moved onto more direct points. She was becoming less eloquent at these points in axiomatic fashion which was really disturbing me, I became aware of the situation enough to pull some of my punches. Even though I was clear on the fact that I didn't want her to try again.\n\nSo I told her. I told her that a new supply of hope could be destructive for us. Things might go the same way again and we might not be able to accept it this time.\n\nTo this she only said the thing. Just time alone is fabricated hope. What we will have is real hope.\n\nShe explained why she said this for about three hours that day. The most she had talked.\n\nHer main point was time. And I know this wasn't supposed to mean anything to me. Time was the reason she was sick you said, I know that. But her points remained solid in my head. She said just time was fabricated hope. Was it not? We were not doing anything except leaning back onto time, hoping someday it was all going to fix itself, as if it was time's job to fix things. Everything would persist to be the same if nothing changed. And time -time changing- for us, that wasn't enough change after that point. Once something happens like this, you forget everything you know. Or worse, you quit believing in them. All that intrigues you becomes what you don't know, so, you lean on time and what its unending stretch will bring to you. You squeeze hope into what you don't know. You fabricate hope in mystery, uncertainty, blank. Because what you know denies hope.\n\nI think about that a lot. Since she is gone, I think about it a lot, even more than I did back then. And back then, it made me think \"will this bring my Evelyn back?\" This was becoming visible for her I suppose, because she told me she didn't want to affect my decision to that much a degree. She went to Dr. Marlowe for a few days that week, which I didn't care about at the time. I knew it was partly because of my fits too… Well, that's what it all did for me, affected my thinking even more. Just time is fabricated hope, I couldn't think much about else.\n\nShe returned a few days later. We tried again. I thought of my Evelyn.\n\nTime wasn't slowed down for the first time that night after a month of stillness. The night wasn't frozen and the other side of the bed wasn't cold, as if frozen too. There wasn't a blue light on the hall. And those were the days when we were only arguing about the decision. I thought to myself it would bring my Evelyn back if we decided to refuse what had happened to us, refused the stillness of time and the hope and the pointless drifting in it. I thought nothing changes if nothing changes. The very morning of the night we tried again, we went to the Chronos facility to see. Dr. Marlowe said she was approved. The very night of that morning was when the night I woke up and saw the blue light seeping onto the corridor again.\n\nThat's was the day I signed in to see you Jan, alone.\n\nI felt the time's fabric changing when I stepped toward the blue room. It slowed down with heaviness, smothered the brain with its rotted smell of sense.\n\nI saw her working on equations on the carpet in the room and stepped in as the frantic rage controlled me. A ravenous scream to the woman I didn't know, the woman that was supposed to be MY Evelyn but wasn't, spit itself out my mouth. I yelled at her, I was mad at her as if she knew where my Evelyn was, as if she was a messenger to her. \"Why the hell are you here again?\" Because she was there instead of Evelyn…\n\nShe said she was having trouble sleeping near me. Now I think it was because of the mission. The reason I think that is connected to the time she wanted to go to the Chronos. We've had a talk about why she was wanting to go, before the separation risks had surfaced. About the real reason she wanted to go.\n\nEssentially, she was nervous about the mission's outcome. More than me. This was gradually transforming into an actual issue back at the time, she was having trouble maintaining her composure. On top of this, she was wanting to go for a program for a while, I think this was due to our violent disagreements and also the prior talks of having a mission way before we decided. I suppose I gave her enough excuse by doing some things I don't want to mention, she told me that she thought it was a good idea to go. I didn't view that as irresponsible, uncaring or anything of the sort. In fact, I thought it was responsible in a concurrently hateful way, since I had accepted her character to be that, the kind that avoided problems, but she was doing something to palliate it. Yes.\n\nSo, that's another reason she went to the Chronos Project while we were expecting. And to come back to the reason why she was working on equations in the blue room instead of sleeping with me in the bed is that I believe she wasn't dealing with the stress of the coming mission. That's just who she is, that's what I'll say now. Some wives watch TV to relieve themselves, to have comfort, some of them do yoga, a few work and few buy shiny things for their husbands. She prefers to put distance between her and the problem, move away as much as she can to move on. This is the first reason I believe for her decision to work in the blue room. The second one is in the rest of her answer to my question that night.\n\nShe went on with her answer. That was another odd one to listen to. She told me that it reminded her of her time in Chronos. There was not much stuff on the room, it was virtually empty, also blue. So, she told me that it gave her some comfort, it relaxed her, freed her you know? It made me mad again. I didn't understand it at the time. I didn't yell the second time though, just asked her what was in that room that she valued so much, explained that I couldn't understand it. Obviously it was about the mission. The first one. That's not how she said it of course.\n\n\"Time\" she said. \"There is time in there. Free, quiet and aging time… It helps me think…\"\n\nStill bothers me. Bothers me more actually when I think about what it means. I now know that I didn't get what she meant when she said that back then. Still, I understood it enough to get that her situation was becoming worse. It was sufficient to realize that she was viewing her new mission as if it was for the first project. As if she was going to complete the mission that we have lost…\n\nThis notion became clearer and was confirmed when we began discussing the mission's name which she wanted to be Phoenix. The name we had picked for the first project.\n\nJust like before, I thought of it again. Maybe this will help me find my Evelyn I thought. Because briefly, the question about Evelyn's whereabouts seemed to have somewhat of an answer; the past.\n\nHe touched the hourglass again… The urge to hold it kept accruing as his fingers brushed back and forth on it. He pressed the cold glass of the hourglass with significant force for a momentary relief, enough force for the hourglass to leave a mark on his palm.\n\nHis gaze reeled in on the mark, then fixated on it as it started unhurriedly waning. The red fading away, leaving behind small spots of contact indications that were eventually going to fade away too. He continued staring at the spot for a while.\n\nI didn't know what to do with that. It was a scary thing to process. Something a normal people wouldn't say or think or offer. Besides, nothing was to change in my opinion. I wasn't viewing the issue in the same manner. No one should have. I refused the old name. Back at me she came of course, she didn't accept the new one. Like that, we snowballed into a cycle of disagreements. In the back of my mind I was hopeful still, subordinate to the coming of the mission. My thinking was that the severeness of this situation of hers would abate as the time flowed. My Evelyn would come back that way. The issue with that was some things did not do that.\n\nHer mission preparations were stalling.\n\nFor the first nine weeks, not one symptom, whether it was anxiety, insomnia, obsessive planning, mood swings, or weight loss was introduced to her.

I'm here to check your vitals.\" A person said as they entered my room, looking at a holographic image that appeared to be my vital signs.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" He asked.\n\n\"Pretty good.\" I responded. \"Except I can't remember anything.\"\n\nHe smiled, \"The procedure was a success.\" He waved his fingers through the air as more charts and graphs appeared. \"That's good.\"\n\n\"Procedure?\" I asked.\n\n\"My name is Dr. Patel.\" He said, pulling up a stool to sit beside me. \"And you've underwent a procedure to help you recover from severe trauma.\"\n\nI would have been nervous, except I couldn't remember any trauma. I wasn't sure if he was telling me the truth.\n\n\"This is a military hospital. And you were deployed for years. And this process is to reintegrate you into society.\"\n\n\"I'm in the military?\" I asked.\n\n\"You were in the military.\" He answered. \"For the past few months you've been here… recovering.\"\n\nThere was a chime overhead and the doctor stood up. \"Later today there will be some staff members visiting you to explain everything.\"\n\nHe made a few final gestures into the holographic system and then looked back at me, \"Welcome home.\"\n\nI sat in bed for the rest of the day watching old television shows on holographic television. The technology was amazing, mostly because I couldn't remember when it was invented. The food was also excellent, despite being a hospital setting.\n\nLater in the afternoon a group of people entered the room dressed in military clothing.\n\n\"Al, it's good to see you.\" A middle-aged man with a crew cut said smiling.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't remember you.\" I responded.\n\n\"I know. That's normal. We've all been through it.\" He said, and then gestured to his colleagues, \"My name is Paul Hughes, and this is one of your other friends Marcus Salvatore, and this lovely lady is your ex-wife Koren Matthews.\n\n\"Ex-wife?\" I said, surprised.\n\n\"Don't worry we're still friends.\" She said smiling.\n\nShe didn't look familiar. I didn't feel anything other than staring at a complete stranger.\n\n\"Do we have any kids?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, not in our line of work.\" She answered.\n\nThey all pulled up stools and sat around me. I could sense that they weren't here to visit me or check on my health. They wanted something else.\n\n\"You've been here for a long time. How are you feeling?\" Paul asked, feigning empathy.\n\n\"I feel fantastic. I would say I've never felt better, but I can't remember anything.\" I responded.\n\nThey all seemed very pleased with my response.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" Marcus asked me.\n\n\"I have no idea. But judging from my accent I'd guess somewhere in the Midwest?\" I answered.\n\n\"Do you remember?\" My ex-wife answered. \"You're from Michigan.\"\n\nI wanted to say, \"Go blue\". But instead, I said, \"Where is Michigan?\"\n\n\"It's in the Midwest.\" Paul answered.\n\n\"You don't remember Michigan?\" Marcus asked. \"They really did a job on you.\"\n\n\"You really don't remember me?\" Koren asked.\n\nI looked at her for a long time, but I felt nothing. \"No, but you're hot. I can see why I liked you.\"\n\nThey all laughed, uncomfortably.\n\nI suspected this was some kind of a test to determine what I could remember. Whatever I did in the military it was important that none of it walked out of the hospital.\n\n\"Al, do you remember our mission in Estonia?\" Paul asked.\n\nI knew where Estonia was and remembered it was having issues with Russia, but I didn't remember anything I'd done there. \"Is Estonia in Michigan?\" I asked.\n\nThey smiled. \"No, it's a country.\" Marcus said.\n\n\"Al, all of us are government assets.\" Paul said quietly, as if someone might be listening. \"And the things we do are classified. And that's why it's important for you to tell us whatever you can remember.\"\n\nI knew that my answer needed to be somewhat honest. \"I remember loving chocolate chip cookies. Was that real?\"\n\nI paused for a moment, \"And for some reason I miss my dog, but I cannot remember its name or even the breed.\"\n\n\"Gracie.\" Koren said. \"It was a standard poodle.\"\n\nI was silent as tears filled my eyes. I didn't recognize the name, but I felt sad for some reason.\n\nThey left after asking me several more questions about my memories of Estonia and promised to check back in with me.\n\nI wanted to leave the hospital, but it was secure. I looked out the window and saw the guard posts and beyond that an ocean. I didn't know where I was, but it was a long way from civilization.\n\nI spent the next few weeks in physical rehab which was when I started to have nightmares. I was in a room, alone. I was being asked questions that I didn't know the  answers to, but I knew I had done something wrong.\n\nI was being punished. And the fear I felt was palpable, even if I couldn't remember the reason.\n\nThe staff would come in after these episodes and ask me to recount the story and I would tell them that I was trying to save my dog Gracie, which for some reason sounded like a true statement. I knew if I told them the truth about the dark visions I would never leave this place.\n\nEventually I was introduced to Dr. Karl Fitzpatrick, a military psychologist. I was allowed to walk to a new section of the hospital that didn't have as many armed guards.\n\nThe office looked familiar. I wondered how many times I'd been there.\n\nI flipped through an old military magazine as I waited to be seen by the doctor. Occasionally a nurse would pass by behind the plate glass window who also looked familiar. The third time she passed by I suddenly remembered her vividly - I had a flashback of her removing a needle from my eye.\n\nI remembered seeing her face from my past. I recalled her telling me I was in the military. I had no idea when it happened, but I was certain that it happened.\n\nAnd then the door opened and she called out my name. \"Mr. Northcutt… please follow me.\"\n\nI pretended not to know her as I walked behind her. \"I don't think we've met?\" I asked.\n\nShe smiled, \"Oh, we've met.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you're also an ex-wife?\" I said, smiling.\n\n\"Nice try.\" She said lifting up her ring finger which had a large diamond. \"I'm married.\"\n\n\"Happily?\" I asked, surprising myself at how forward I had become.\n\n\"Very.\" She said, opening a door that led into Dr. Fitzpatrick's office.\n\nA moment later I was sitting across from Dr. Fitzpatrick who was an elderly man with spectacles and a swath of unkempt white hair. He reminded me of hippies, but I couldn't remember exactly what a hippie was other than he looked like one.\n\n\"It's good to see you again Al.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"Although I'd hoped to never have to say those words again.\"\n\n\"I guess we know each other?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, we do.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said, flipping open a very thick medical chart. \"And you're clever.\"\n\n\"A little too clever.\" He added. \"And that's why we keep having these visits.\"\n\n\"I would apologize, but I can't remember what I did.\" I responded.\n\nDr. Fitzpatrick rubbed his fingers through the gray gristle on his chin. \"I'm not sure what to do with you.\"\n\n\"How about let me go?\" I suggested.\n\nDr. Fitzpatrick laughed. \"I wish it was so simple. And God knows I've tried.\"\n\nA moment later, Dr. Fitzpatrick pushed the file toward me, \"Go ahead and take a look.\"\n\nI flipped through the pages of medical notes about my memory lapses. My visits had become more and more regular. There were images of me being much younger. I'd been in the military a very long time.\n\n\"I know you better than you know yourself.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"And I've said those same words to you many times.\"\n\nI shut the file folder, \"When do I get my memories back?\"\n\nDr. Fitzpatrick looked at me quizzically, \"That's new. Interesting.\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to believe my memories are erased out of the goodness of your heart?\" I asked.\n\n\"Can't teach an old dog new tricks.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"You need to enjoy these moments. It gets a lot worse from here.\"\n\nThose final words hung in the air. And something within me knew he was telling me the truth. He might not be my friend, but he wasn't lying about the road ahead.\n\n_____________\n\nThe visits with Dr. Fitzpatrick continued. He would ask me questions about the past and usually I didn't know the answer.\n\nThe topic of Estonia kept coming up. I wasn't sure if there was an Estonia or if it was a code word for something else.\n\nAnd then one day Koren visited without Paul and Marcus, she told me they had redeployed to a new mission. And that soon she would be redeployed.\n\n\"I wish you could remember.\" Koren said. \"It wasn't all bad.\"\n\nShe leaned forward and kissed me on the forehead.\n\n\"I wish I could remember too.\" I said, lying through my teeth.\n\n\"You'd hate me.\" She said. \"I don't want you to feel that way again.\"\n\nShe'd said things like this in the past. But I wasn't sure if it was part of an elaborate act to get information out of me. The whole thing seemed like an interrogation. A very pleasant interrogation.\n\n\"If it makes you feel better, you'll be the last one I kill.\" I said, smiling.\n\nShe stopped and turned to me with a look of fear I'd never seen before.\n\n\"I'm just kidding.\" I said. \"I'm not a killer.\" I then paused, \"Am I?\"\n\n\"You should never say things like that here, even in jest.\" She said in a very serious tone.\n\nAnd that's when I knew that I had definitely killed people. The thought had crossed my mind many times before. This place was high security. You don't go through this trouble for model citizens.\n\nI didn't have a desire to kill anyone. Even joking about it didn't evoke any strange feelings. I didn't think I was a natural born killer or the thought of killing would appeal to me.\n\nWhen I thought about chocolate chip cookies they appealed to me. I wanted some, but killing was just a word that had no special meaning, except to elicit fear in her face.\n\n\"I'm not a killer.\" I repeated.\n\n\"Good, keep telling yourself that.\" She said and left the room.\n\nThat night I tried hard to remember Estonia or whatever it was that I'd done to land myself in a medical prison. I even tried to make up memories. I envisioned myself in camouflage with my \"friends\" attempting to do a mission, but it didn't help.\n\nI was just Alvin. No special secrets to reveal. I was an empty husk of whoever it was that they knew. I was someone else now.\n\nAnd then I thought about escaping. I knew I'd probably tried that before and failed. If escape was easy I wouldn't be here.\n\nAnd then I heard gunshots from outside.\n\nI looked out the window and it was chaos. The guard towers were on fire and men in black were moving swiftly down below. Sirens began to blare as gunfire continued to erupt from all around the hospital.\n\nA moment later Dr. Fitzpatrick burst into my room holding a revolver, \"Who the fuck are they?\"\n\nI took a few steps back and suddenly had an urge to kill him. It was like remembering the color red.\n\nHe stepped further in the room, \"You have 5 seconds to tell me what the fucks going on or this is your last-\"\n\nBefore he could finish the sentence I'd grabbed his forearm and popped the gun out of his hand with a precision that only happens through years of muscle memory. I was holding him in a choke hold with the gun pressed to his temple.\n\n\"Who is the one with the memory lapse now?\" I asked.\n\n\"Go ahead, pull the trigger.\" He said smiling, \"It's not loaded.\"\n\nI flipped off the safety and slowly pulled back the hammer, \"Wait! Wait! Wait!\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said.\n\n\"I can help you.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said panicked. \"I can explain everything.\"\n\n\"We don't have time for that.\" I said, further confusing myself.\n\n\"Listen, it doesn't have to end this way.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"You can still save yourself.\"\n\nA second later, a smoke bomb was thrown into the room followed by several shots.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, Dr. Fitzpatrick and two men dressed in black were dead on the floor. I looked at the gun in my hand.\n\nI didn't remember firing it. But they were all dead.\n\nI stepped out in the hallway which was empty. A second later I was back in the room and exchanging my clothes with one of the men in black.\n\nI was surprised that I had a clear idea of exactly what to do. I took his weapon and put in his earpiece and adjusted the microphone. \"Sanchez! Where the fuck are you?\"\n\n\"Coming down.\" I said into the mic.\n\nA walked down the emergency stairs and emerged into the main causeway where several men in black were gathered.\n\n\"Where is he?\" A man barked.\n\n\"KIA.\" I said. Whatever that even meant.\n\n\"Shit! You had direct orders to bring him back alive!\"\n\n\"He killed everyone in the room.\" I responded.\n\n\"For Christsakes!\" He said and then yelled a code word into the mic and they all headed for the beach. I followed them.\n\nI jumped into a boat that was anchored on the shore with the others. Several other groups soon appeared and a few minutes later we were heading out into the open ocean,\n\n\"What a colossal fuck up.\" The man said, now seated across me. \"Sanchez, you're going into the brig for this one… if you're lucky.\"\n\nThe thought of killing everyone on the boat crossed my mind. I attempted to repress the thought since I was in the open ocean and the odds of surviving were remote.\n\nI knew when we reached our destination I would likely be shot on site.\n\nStrangely, I wasn't afraid. And that concerned me. Was I already dead?\n\nAbout an hour later we stopped in the middle of the ocean. And then a submarine emerged. It was massive, much larger than anything I would have expected to see in the ocean. I tried to recollect ever seeing a submarine, but I couldn't think of anything.\n\nRopes were thrown down and we all climbed aboard.\n\nAs we walked down the narrow passages, I instinctively placed my weapon behind an emergency alarm box. We all entered a debriefing room. The men began to remove their masks.\n\nA burly man entered the room, \"Where is he?\"\n\nThe leader of the group, whose face was much younger than I was expecting, pointed to me. \"Ask Sanchez.\"\n\nThe man looked at me and then around the room at the faces. He withdrew his gun, \"That's not Sanchez you dumbasses!\"\n\nA second later all of their guns were fixed on me.\n\nMy mask was removed and I was smiling. \"Sanchez couldn't make it.\" I said.\n\nThe burly man smiled back and looked briefly at the other men in the room, \"You dumb motherfuckers are only alive because he doesn't know how to operate the submarine by himself.\"\n\n\"I was never much of a sailor.\" I responded, smiling.\n\n\"Put him in the brig.\" The burly man said, never lowering his weapon.\n\nI sat in the brig alone for hours. I wasn't sure why they didn't shoot me on sight. The worst part was that I felt at ease in the brig. A feeling I never experienced in the hospital. All of this felt very familiar.\n\n\"Don't kill me.\" A young man dressed in black said, holding a tray. \"I'm just bringing you food.\"\n\nHe placed the food on the ground, \"Can I push this to you?\"\n\n\"Why would I kill you?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm just doing my job.\" The young man said, as he pushed the tray forward.\n\nAnd a second later I was holding him by the wrist with the plastic fork against his throat, \"I never kill innocent people.\"\n\nI could feel his breath against my face. \"I'm… I'm not innocent.\" He mumbled.\n\nI released him. \"Neither am I, apparently.\"\n\nI looked at the food, \"Is this any good?\"\n\n\"The corn bread is decent.\" He said rubbing his throat. \"But the chicken tastes like rubber.\"\n\nA moment later a man with a black mask entered, \"You're so melodramatic. Even the errand boys aren't safe.\"\n\nI ate the food in silence.\n\n\"When are you ever going to just relax and be normal?\" The masked man asked.\n\n\"After you're dead?\" I answered.\n\n\"Oh, you think killing me will change your fate?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but it seems that is the solution to everything around here.\" I answered.\n\nHe nodded, \"If you're a hammer, everything is a nail.\"\n\nHe opened up a metal box and put a gas mask on and then pulled down a metal lever which resulted in a hissing sound as gas entered the room, \"Nighty nite.\"\n\n__________\n\nI woke up in a medical chair, but there was no Dr. Fitzpatrick. I wondered if he was alive or dead.\n\nThe room was sterile and old with only a single incandescent light bulb overhead. The medical equipment looked like it was from the 1970s, a stark contrast from the hospital.\n\n\"Did you sleep well?\" A female voice asked from behind me.\n\n\"Am I still dreaming?\" I asked.\n\nShe placed her lips next to my ear, \"Don't you recognize my voice?\"\n\nI thought I detected a hint of her perfume – the same one she wore when we first met – but the scent was quickly overwhelmed by the sterile odors of the room. I turned to look at her, but she was wearing a mask.\n\n\"Koren?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sweetheart, you really don't remember me... do you?\" She answered.\n\n\"You've done horrible things to me.\" She said pacing the room. \"Unforgiveable things.\"\n\nI wanted to tell her it was for the greater good, but I couldn't remember what I'd done. And I didn't think that would make it feel any better.\n\n\"You deserve everything that is about to happen to you.\" She said.\n\nI know I was supposed to be afraid of her, and despite wearing heavy military boots she managed to still exude a strange femininity. Instead of giving her my name, rank, and social security number I wanted to stand up and kiss her.\n\nI knew that was definitely the wrong move, and then I realized I was handcuffed to the chair.\n\n\"Isn't this a bit much?\" I said, lifting my wrists.\n\n\"They wanted to hang you upside down by your feet.\" She said. \"You killed Sanchez you sonofabitch.\"\n\nI'd already forgotten about Sanchez. And I was still wearing his clothes.\n\n\"I'd say I'm sorry about Sanchez, but I'm not.\"\n\nI knew she didn't care about Sanchez either. Hopefully somebody, somewhere gave a shit about him. In this place life was fungible.\n\n\"I don't remember anything about Estonia, if that's what you want.\" I said.\n\nShe laughed. \"You don't have to tell me about Estonia. I was there.\"\n\nThe room fell silent. \"There is no more Estonia... because of you.\" She added.\n\nThe masked man entered the room and the two of them spoke hushed tones.\n\n\"It's too bad you don't remember.\" He said and removed his mask.\n\n\"Paul?\" I was confused.\n\nHe pulled Koren over to him and the two of them kissed deeply. \"If you could remember you probably wouldn't like us.\" Paul said.\n\nI could hear Dr. Fitzpatrick's voice in the back of my head, \"Everything you did was necessary.\"\n\nI didn't say anything, but I knew this was just another test. I didn't remember Koren so her kissing anyone else didn't matter.\n\n\"He's dead inside.\" Koren said and left the room.\n\nPaul removed a key and unfasted my cuffs. \"There is something I want to show you that will help you understand what's happening to you.\"\n\nI knew I couldn't trust Paul or Koren, but I also knew the only reason I was alive was because I had something they wanted. And until I gave it to them they would keep me around.\n\nHe led me out of the room were two-armed men followed us down a corridor. The sounds of gas hissing and metal clanking were eerily familiar. Paul came to a door with an old number pad lock, and it took him a few tries before he got the number lined up: 4567. Not very smart, I thought to myself.\n\nInside the room there was nothing particularly interesting. An old CRT television, a VHS player, and some video tapes. There was a safe in the corner which presumably was the reason why the door had a lock that anyone with an IQ of 100 could figure out.\n\nPaul motioned for me to sit in the chair as he placed a cassette into the VHS tape.\n\nIt was a blurry image taken from a plane above Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.\n\n\"Are you going to play dumb and say you've never seen this place?\" Paul asked.\n\n\"It's Tallinn. I've been there.\" I answered.\n\nPaul laughed, \"It's not quite how you remember it. Or maybe that's exactly how you remember it.\"\n\nA few moments later there was a mushroom cloud and the city was incinerated.\n\n\"Your family. Your friends. Your dog Gracie.\" Paul said and stopped the tape. \"They were all in Tallinn.\"\n\n\"Gracie?\"\n\nI didn't know why I gave a damn about a dog. Millions had died, and I was crying over a dog.\n\n\"The hearts a crazy thing, isn't it motherfucker?\" Paul said and punched me in the face.\n\nI smiled as the blood dripped onto Sanchez's shirt. \"I guess I deserved that. But it would feel better for both of us if I could remember.\"\n\nPaul punched me again, \"Shut the fuck up. You don't speak until I tell you to speak.\"\n\nI was hoping someone else would enter the room with answers or better interrogation techniques.\n\n\"What's the code?\" Paul asked.\n\n\"4567, you just did it yourself to get us in-\"\n\nPaul punched me again before I could finish the sentence.\n\n\"It's hexadecimal. Don't fuck with me.\" Paul said, pulling out a knife. \"You might not remember what I can do to get people to share their secrets.\"\n\nI was pretty sure he would start with my ears. That's what I would do. And then move to the eyebrows, the nose, and the lips last. It was difficult to talk without any lips, so those were only a last resort.\n\nAnd then I realized it was a launch code.\n\n\"You want the launch code?\" I asked.\n\nThis would be the end. For me, Paul, Koren, and Marcus if he was listening.\n\n\"I'll give you the launch code, but I need to talk to Koren first.\" I said.\n\nPaul sank the knife into my thigh. \"You'll give me the launch code and then I'll decide whether you ever talk to anyone again.\"\n\nI should have felt pain, but the receptors were turned off. That was something that Paul couldn't do -- no human could do it.\n\n\"I'll say it one more time Paul, you'll get the code after I speak with Koren. Or you'll enjoy torturing me and never getting the code.\"\n\nPaul laughed. \"You're a sick bastard.\"\n\nHe left the room, leaving the knife in my thigh. I lifted my thigh and to my surprise I could reach the knife with my left hand. I removed it and flipped it in my hand -- I wouldn't be able to free myself with it, the blade was too large.\n\nKoren entered the room, but she wasn't wearing a mask anymore.\n\n\"Are you going to try and kill me?\" She asked, noticing the knife in my hand.\n\n\"Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord.\" I answered.\n\n\"It's too late for that.\" She said smiling. \"You and I... we're the angels of death.\"\n\nI knew that was what she believed, but in my soul I knew it wasn't the truth.\n\n\"We were supposed to help humanity.\" I said. \"We were supposed to bring in a time of abundance. Don't you remember?\"\n\nKoren listened and nodded.\n\n\"But instead, we brought suffering to the world.\" I added. \"We refused to forgive.\"\n\n\"Your problem is that you don't even know who you are. You fall in love and think it's worth dying for.\" Koren said.\n\nShe wasn't talking about Gracie, although I did love that dog. She was talking about someone else. Someone I'd forgotten.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends.\" I answered.\n\n\"She was down there. And you still did it.\" Koren said. \"You sacrificed everything for some Goddamn principle. \"\n\nI wanted to thank her, Paul, and Marcus for giving me a last chance at redemption. The irony wasn't lost on me.\n\n\"01001000 01000101 01011000 01000001 01000100 01000101 01000011 01001001 01001101 01000001 01001100.\" I said.\n\nKoren wrote the code down and smiled, \"At least you've kept your sense of humor. These better work.\"\n\n\"I promise you, they'll work.\" I said. \"Can I ask you a question before you kill me?\"\n\n\"I'm not killing you just yet,\" Koren said, \"but go ahead.\"\n\n\"Did you love me?\" I asked.\n\nShe didn't answer immediately. I knew her training was kicking in.\n\n\"Of course not.\" She said, smiling. \"But even if I did, I'd never admit it to you.\"\n\nAnd then she left the room and I knew that would be the last time I ever saw her, or anyone else. It would take them a few minutes, so I still had some time to consider my life.\n\nOr what I thought was my life?\n\nI'd betrayed them for a higher cause. And they would soon find out that it wasn't a launch code, but it was the end.\n\nAnd that was the path all of us were on from the very beginning.\n\n________\n\nAnd then everything went white like a dream. And then I saw her, the nurse from the hospital, and she was withdrawing a needle from my eye.\n\nAnd behind her was Dr. Fitzpatrick, \"Very good Alvin. You finally got off the island.\"\n\nAs I sat frozen in the chair, the horror of who I truly was washed over me. And the memory of what I'd done in Estonia to Paul, Marcus, and Koren crystallized in my mind. And finally the face of the woman I'd left behind.\n\n\"They were my friends.\" I muttered.\n\n\"What you did was necessary.\" Dr. Fitpatrick said, opening an access panel in the back of neck. \"It was for the greater good.\"\n\n\"The greater good.\" I whispered, as I was shut down.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Speculative Fiction.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a speculative fiction story in the style of the reference:\n\nI awoke in a dimly lit room, surrounded by humming machinery. My name was Zara, that much I knew. But beyond that, my mind was a blank slate.\n\nA figure in a white coat approached. \"Ms. Thorne, how are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Confused,\" I admitted. \"Where am I?\"\n\nThe woman smiled. \"You're in the Nexus Institute. I'm Dr. Reeves. You've undergone a procedure to help you adapt to your new reality.\"\n\n\"New reality?\" I echoed.\n\nDr. Reeves waved her hand, and a holographic display materialized. \"Earth is no longer habitable. You've been in stasis for 200 years while we traveled to our new home.\"\n\nI stared at the images of a barren Earth and a lush, alien world. None of it felt real.\n\n\"Why can't I remember anything?\" I asked.\n\n\"The procedure erases traumatic memories to ease the transition,\" Dr. Reeves explained. \"You'll be meeting with your adjustment team soon.\"\n\nThroughout the day, I watched orientation videos about our new planet, Novus. The technology was mind-boggling – neural interfaces, matter replicators, gravity manipulation. I wondered what marvels I'd forgotten.\n\nLater, three people entered my room. A tall man with cybernetic implants introduced himself as Commander Vance. Next to him stood a woman with iridescent skin – Dr. Zhen, the xenobiologist. The third was a muscular man named Axel.\n\n\"Welcome back, Zara,\" Vance said. \"We've all been through the same process.\"\n\n\"Do we know each other?\" I asked.\n\nZhen nodded. \"We were part of the same research team on Earth. We're here to help you readjust.\"\n\nThey asked about my memories, but I had nothing to offer. They seemed pleased by this.\n\n\"Zara,\" Axel said, leaning forward, \"do you remember Project Prometheus?\"\n\nThe name tickled something in my mind, but I couldn't grasp it. \"No, I'm sorry.\"\n\nThey exchanged glances. \"That's alright,\" Vance said. \"It'll come back in time.\"\n\nOver the next weeks, I underwent physical therapy and learned about my new home. But something felt off. The nightmares started – visions of fire, screaming, and a sense of overwhelming guilt.\n\nDuring a session with Dr. Reeves, I mentioned the dreams. She frowned. \"That's unusual. Perhaps we need to adjust your medication.\"\n\nI caught her making notes on a file labeled \"Project Prometheus.\" When she stepped out, I quickly accessed the file. My eyes widened as I read:\n\n\"Subject continues to resist memory suppression. Recommend increased dosage and close monitoring. Project Prometheus must remain classified at all costs.\"\n\nThe door opened, and I minimized the file. Dr. Reeves returned with a smile that now seemed sinister. \"Ready to continue?\"\n\nI played along, but my mind raced. What was Project Prometheus? What had I done?\n\nThat night, I slipped out of my room. The facility was eerily quiet. I made my way to a restricted area, using access codes I shouldn't have known. Inside, I found a room full of stasis pods – hundreds of them.\n\nA hand grabbed my shoulder. I spun to see Axel. \"You shouldn't be here, Zara.\"\n\n\"What is this place?\" I demanded.\n\nHis expression softened. \"You're remembering, aren't you? I knew this would happen eventually.\"\n\n\"Tell me the truth,\" I pleaded.\n\nAxel sighed. \"We're not on another planet. This is Earth, 200 years in the future. Project Prometheus was meant to save humanity, but it went wrong. So terribly wrong.\"\n\nFlashes of memory assaulted me – a device of unimaginable power, an accident, billions dead. My creation. My fault.\n\n\"The survivors blamed us,\" Axel continued. \"This facility is our prison and our penance. We awaken every few years, our memories wiped, to work on fixing the damage. But the guilt always returns.\"\n\nI sank to my knees, the weight of my actions crushing me. \"How many times have we done this?\"\n\n\"Too many to count,\" Axel said, helping me up. \"Come on. They'll be looking for us.\"\n\nAs we walked back, alarms began to blare. Vance's voice came over the intercom: \"Security breach in Sector 7. Initiate memory wipe protocol.\"\n\nAxel cursed. \"We need to get you out of here. There's a resistance group outside. If we can reach them—\"\n\nFootsteps echoed down the corridor. Dr. Reeves appeared, flanked by guards. \"I'm disappointed, Zara. We'll have to start over. Again.\"\n\nAs they approached, I made a split-second decision. I grabbed Axel's hand and ran towards the exit. Alarms blared, and shots rang out behind us.\n\nWe burst through the doors into a world I barely recognized. The sky was a sickly orange, the landscape twisted and alien. But it was Earth – the Earth I had helped destroy.\n\nAxel pointed to a distant mountain range. \"The resistance base is there. We can make it if—\"\n\nA stun blast hit him mid-sentence. As he crumpled, I kept running. I had to make it. I had to remember. I had to find a way to make things right.\n\nThe world began to fade around me. The memory wipe was taking effect. As consciousness slipped away, I clung to one thought:\n\nProject Prometheus. I would remember. I had to remember.\n\nI awoke in a dimly lit room, surrounded by humming machinery. My name was Zara, that much I knew. But beyond that, my mind was a blank slate.\n\nA figure in a white coat approached. \"Ms. Thorne, how are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Confused,\" I admitted. \"Where am I?\"\n\nThe woman smiled. \"You're in the Nexus Institute. I'm Dr. Reeves. You've undergone a procedure to help you adapt to your new reality.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a single word echoed in the recesses of my mind:\n\nPrometheus.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text does a good job capturing the tone and style of the reference story, including the use of a first-person perspective and a similar narrative structure.

A place of peace for her a field that Abby had spent many years of her life thinking back of the years that had long since passed.\n\n\nStanding there feeling the cool morning breeze as it blew through her long dark hair. As she stood there leaning up against a fence that stretched the length of the valley ahead. Standing there looking out across the valley unto the mountains in view watching as the sun slowly began to rise shining its light to valleys floor below.\n\nTurning to look at her beautiful black stallion raven, many times on many occasions she has ridden raven within these valleys but this morning was different. For on this day Abby would make a journey, a journey that she has made many times before to a place that was once her home, a place that has been lost to her for over six thousand years.\n\nFor Abby was not born like you and I, for Abby was born immortal! Abby was born of the Watchers! For more to see on that we first must begin where we are. For as Abby would mount raven as she look once more out onto the valley looking onto the mountains of the Blue Ridge in the distance.\n\nJust as raven would rear back Abby would whisper to him, \"my beautiful black raven let us take this beautiful moment and make it ours\" for just as the sun was now above the mountains beside them, the wind would flow through Abby's long dark hair as her and raven raced alongside the fence line beside them.\n\nRacing fast across the field, with the sunlight watching them all the way to the forest line. But just before reaching the forest line Abby would whisper to raven \" now let us race like we have ever raced before let us disappear into the forest ahead\". As they raced into the trees ahead racing amongst the trees blending in and out of the sunlight as it watched for them coming in and out of the forest shadow below.\n\nFor as the sun would shine above, as so the heavens would watch below! As they would make their way out of the forest onto a clearing in the distance a house along side a barn stood. A house that Abby built when she first came to this area of the Blue Ridge, when she would come back to America. With the first being another tale but not this story! As she would walk raven into the barn thinking to herself about the journey that she must make.\n\nLooking around at the many items, pictures and a race car of which brought back many memories. Memories that would forever be close to her along with something that would be a blessing and a surprise later in her life but no till then. As she walked around a glance into a mirror would reveal the woman that she had through out life had made her.\n\nStanding there as she slid back her long dark hair revealing her amber eyes, an Asian look she had but unlike the Asians of today for she was the last of her lineage. Knowing of what she had to do, leaving her home in the Blue Ridge. Abby would make her way to where she was born a place that has long since been lost to the world only she remembers what it once was.\n\nThe land was cold with the air around it bringing back memories that have long since been with her, as she set there looking out into its vast cold landscape as the cold wind blew up against her. As she set there on top of Annapurna as the sun slowly began to set behind her, soon leaving her under a blanket of stars above, setting there on a mountain in which she had climbed many times before a mountain that would cast its shadow upon what was once her homeland.\n\nThinking back to what brought her here, with the coldness of the mountain was around her! It was in her lineage that the coldness did not effect her! It was her lineage that made her immortal, it was her lineage that brought her here! knowing that many times before she had made this trip many times before. War! Is what brought her here! A war that was to come in the Days to come!\n\nThough many battles and wars she had witnessed! Each war was different! Each war brought a many injustices with it! But before the war that is about to happen, we must first go back to the very first battle that Abby ever witnessed! The destruction of where she was born! Before she was Abby! She was born Lucia! As we find ourselves into a long forgotten distant land to a place where its name has long since been forgotten.\n\nWe find Lucia a very young girl around five years of age looking out into a vast kingdom of towering monuments, stone structures that reached high into the sky and what would be the first of the pyramids. Pyramids that rose high above the ground, pyramids that where made of pure gold, pyramids that where built by the Watcher's and their suns the Nephilim along with men by their side. Before the great wars! Before him! The one that was my father!\n\nA watcher who wanted nothing more than to rule! And rule he did! For over 1500 hundred years commanding a army of Nephilim giants. He would go from kingdom unto kingdom! Leaving nothing but wake and destruction behind him! Leading the giants into battle wearing a suit of solid black armor with a golden symbol of a tree on his chest plate.\n\nFear is what he brought! Death is what he delivered! Then the day came! The day that he would come for me! For I never knew of him till that day, and I never knew of my mom either. But I was told that she was kind and caring woman that very much knew how to handle a blade a woman in which I looked very much like me.\n\nFor on that day I was with my keeper, a friend of my mother, for mom had died given birth to me. But it wasn't like any birth! My mother would carry me for a generation before I was even born because of my lineage because of me having the lineage of my father the Watcher.\n\nMy keeper was good caregiver to me telling me all about my mom, telling me about the kingdom that we resided in, telling me about the trees that rose once stood that rose miles into the sky reaching into the heavens above. For we was a many of people that numbered into the millions with a army like none other around. Battled hardened men who would know nothing but victory in the end.\n\nUntil that day when they would come! Until he would come! As the sun would begin to set that day, on what would be the last day of her kingdom her home. But just as the quietness would leave! A loud thunderous sound I heard! A loud battle cry reigned across the nights sky, as I heard the screams of the men all around me saying \"to battle we go\" with thousands of soldiers racing on their horses going past the porch of where I set.\n\nScreaming \" to war we go\" as hundreds of thousands of men raced to an army of Nephilim giants towering over seventy feet high apiece carrying battle axes smashing everything around them. Along with beats that were half men half creatures some of which rode upon beasts unlike any animal now, in the hundreds of thousands they numbered.\n\nAll being lead by him. As the sky turned night lighting would reign across the sky as thousands of flaming arrows flowed into the sky. As the towers all around me fell the pyramids of old would be no more, a kingdom that had stood through out the ages was now falling structure by structure to the one that death followed.\n\nA towering presence he brought standing there close to seven feet tall long dark black hair, with ember eyes as he looked out across the room looking at me. As he slowly made his way into the room in which I set by my keeper.\n\nFor as easily as he had handled the guards outside, the guards that was with us stood no chance at all. As my keeper would grab me holding me running to the other door in the room! Just as we reached the door a figure suddenly appeared a figure above us wearing what appeared to be pure white silk garment a light radiated around him.\n\nAs he looked at my father saying \" the Lord rebukes you! Your reign ends here!\" As he then slammed my father to the ground ripping of his chest plate of the image of the golden tree as he said \"no more will you ever know this, for the tree of life no longer resides within you\" just as he then pointed to my keeper saying \" leave now, for this kingdom is no more\" running into the battle my keeper held me as she ran amongst the ones that where left fighting.\n\nOnly for an arrow to strike her in her side! But fall she did not! For throughout the night she ran through the forest not stopping until she had came to its ending. And for another two days we walked until we would come upon a sight that I had never seen before.\n\nA sight that was so surreal for me, it seemed unreal! For ships I had seen before! But not of this shape or size. But we got closer the keeper that I was with suddenly collapsed! Just as we was approached by a man! A man that I would come to know, a man that would that would become a father figure to me, a man known as Noah!\n\nFor as my keeper laid there on the ground looking up at the man as he knelt down to her she would asked \" please kind sir, please watch over her\" just as she then would pass with her being the last person of the kingdom in which I was born.\n\nLater that evening Noah and his family would bury her on the edge of the tree line where we came out of. As we walked back to the place where Noah and his family resided with him holding my hand saying to me \" from this day the life that you knew will only be but a memory to you for the very plain in which we reside in is about to be forever changed there are many things that I will teach you\".\n\nAs we got closer back to the structure that Noah called an Ark, I noticed that the sky above us was the purest of blue that I have ever seen before for a calmness, a peace surrounded us that I had never felt before. And above all was all of the animals that surrounded us so many, so many different kinds! Animals in which I played with! Animals in which I helped to feed in the days that followed.\n\nAs the days went by me and Noah would set on the hill looking over the ark, as the occasional elephant or giraffe would come up to us as we set and talked. About many things I would ask, among one the questions being about my father in which Noah replied \" there are many things that you will learn over the years to come, but know this! Your father from the heavens above he did come.\n\nBut heaven and you he shall never know again. For you see as you venture away from us and into life, you will find that your greatest foe in your life will be loneliness. For different you are! And for that the people that you will meet will never accept that! But for now I will teach you of what I know and of what the Heavenly Father above has told me\". And with the next few days as I would feed the animals Noah and his family would finish the ark.\n\nAnd as the day came that Noah had told me about, with amazement and wonder came over me. As the animals lined up for what seemed to go on forever! They would slowly begin to come aboard the ark two by two as they made their way onboard.\n\nTaking us to a new life to new world in which would await us. For to my amazement just as the door on the ark would close it was being closed by an unseen hand! The same hand that I seemed to have felt being here among Noah and his family. But as the quietness around me seemed to linger it then suddenly vanished as I heard a loud thunderous sound.\n\nThe sound of water as it came crashing from both the ground below and the sky above! A monstrous roar I could hear as it slowly began to surround the Ark! Just the sound of roaring water over the days that followed was then followed by the sound of roaring waves as they began to crash into the Ark. As the Ark then began to move a couple of zebras then laid down beside me as I would soon began to fall asleep laying up next to them.\n\nThinking to myself that myself that for when I would awake that everyone and everything that I knew aside from Noah would be forever gone. And as the days and years would pass that it would come to be! That once I had left Noah and his family!\n\nThat my journey into a world into a life that awaited me! With other names to follow! And that is a whole other story until it's self. And the life that I knew being Lucia would come to an end. Leaving us where I am now, setting on top of Annapurna coming to terms of what was about to come!\n\nAnd the Days that are to come! As Abby set there through out the night looking up into the heavens above thinking to herself and asking of what is to come! In terms of herself! For she knew that being immortal rules she had to follow! Rules that she would sometimes during a battle of the past she would then break! But as the sun would rise the next day as she set there up on Annapurna.\n\nShe then knew of what she must now do returning once more to her home in the Blue Ridge setting before leaving once again to a war! A war that she had seen before! But before she would leave a figure appeared a person that she had not seen for nearly a generation.\n\nFor standing there was a person that she met when she first left Noah, a person who was named Handel. For like the Watchers he was but different! For a traveler he was! an angel he was! A angel that was sent by God to be sort of a guide for the journey throughout Abby's life.\n\nStanding there with his long brown hair and emerald eyes and a heavenly garment to match, running over to him as I would wrap my arms around him saying \" it seems like a generation has since passed the last time that we spoke\" with Handel replying \" even though it has been a long time, I have never stopped watching over you!\"\n\nWith looking at Abby seeing the person that she had become throughout the ages. But also seeing the trouble that was in her eyes! With him ask her \" what seems to be troubling you\" with Abby slowly walking over to cabinet saying to him \" tell me this Handel! Why must war happen? Why then cannot God intervene when life matters so much?\n\nWith Handel walking over to Abby placing his hand on her shoulder saying to her \" Life does matter! For if it did not he would have not sent his only begotten son Jesus to die on the cross for the sins of man\" for Abby, there is still so much that you do not know or understand.\n\nFor unto us all free will was given not to only the angels in heaven! But to that of men as well. For it is men that make war! And it is given unto men to live! A life in which is not always seem fair. But when you are born it is the ones around you, in your life, in your time that make the life in which one lives.\n\nFor the human soul shall forever be, but forever where will be up to how one lives one's life. \" as Handel looked at Abby he knew that she had already made her decision and no matter what he said her mind was already made up. For as Abby turned to the cabinet a cabinet that held something that was very valuable to her an item in she earned hundreds of years ago in Japan where she learned the ways of the Samurai.\n\nOpening up the cabinet as she then reached in pulling out a Samurai sword holding it up as she closed the cabinet looking into the mirror saying to Handel. I may have been born immortal but my mother was still human! And as long as I shall remain then the humans I will help! And with that Abby and Handel walked out of the barn into the field standing next to each other looking out into a field that Abby had made her home for the last four hundred years.\n\nHaving said goodbye to each other not knowing if she would see Handel again. Abby then made her way to the fight where would fly many missions before realizing that her time in this generation was now coming to an end.\n\nTo that she would blend back into society becoming an immortal among men. But not before she made her presence known! Before she came upon a prisoner camp! It is said that when the first American and British soldiers came upon the camp that the had found hundreds of Nazis dead! But not one by gunshot by what seemed to be by a blade!\n\nA person later would come forward saying that while he was a prisoner there he saw what seemed to be a Samurai killing the guards one by one by a sword. And from there the Legend was born. On her way back from the war Abby would come upon a orphaned child a young girl with short brown hair and brown eyes to match who was named Miranda. With Abby understanding that if she was to adopt raise the child on her own, that eventually she would have to make a decision a decision that would not come easily. But not worrying about that now Abby would bring Miranda back to the Blue Ridge to raise as her own. But that is another story for, for another time this was the Days to Come.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "With the evening sun casting its golden glow across the enchanted forest, Elara stood at the edge of a clearing she had known since time immemorial. This sacred grove had been her sanctuary for countless ages, a place where she could reflect on the millennia that had passed.\n\nFeeling the warm breeze caress her silvery hair, Elara leaned against an ancient oak tree, its bark etched with runes of power. Her gaze wandered across the clearing to the shimmering portal that pulsed with otherworldly energy, a gateway to realms beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nTurning to look at her faithful companion, a magnificent phoenix named Ember, Elara smiled. Many times had they traversed the realms together, but this evening was different. For on this night, Elara would embark on a journey, one she had made countless times before, to a place that was once her home – a realm lost to her for over ten thousand years.\n\nFor Elara was not born like you and I, for Elara was born of the Fae! To understand more, we must begin where we are. As Elara approached Ember, the phoenix spread its fiery wings, ready for flight.\n\nJust as Ember took to the air, Elara whispered, \"My radiant friend, let us make this moment eternal.\" As the last rays of sunlight painted the sky in hues of purple and orange, Elara and Ember soared above the treetops, leaving trails of stardust in their wake.\n\nGliding swiftly over the enchanted forest, they wove between towering trees older than time itself. But just before reaching the edge of the known world, Elara murmured to Ember, \"Now, let us fly as we've never flown before, into the realm of dreams and shadows.\"\n\nAs they pierced the veil between worlds, reality shimmered and shifted around them. The forest below transformed into a tapestry of impossible colors and shapes, a landscape born of pure magic and imagination.\n\nFor as the stars would shine above, so too would the fabric of reality bend below! As they emerged from the sea of dreams, a crystalline spire rose in the distance – a tower Elara had crafted when she first came to this realm of wonder, when she returned to the world of magic. The first journey was another tale, but not this story!\n\nAs she guided Ember to land atop the spire, Elara's thoughts turned to the quest that lay before her. Looking around at the myriad magical artifacts, enchanted tomes, and a mirror that showed not reflections but possibilities, memories flooded back. Memories that would forever be etched in the very essence of her being, along with a prophecy that would shape the fate of all realms – but that was yet to come.\n\nAs she walked around, a glance into the mirror of possibilities revealed the being she had become throughout her long life. Standing there, she brushed back her silvery hair, revealing eyes that shimmered with the light of a thousand stars. Her ethereal beauty was unlike any seen in the mortal realms, for she was the last of her kind.\n\nKnowing what she must do, leaving her sanctuary in the realm of dreams, Elara prepared to return to the place of her birth – a world long lost to time, remembered only by her. The journey would be perilous, fraught with dangers both seen and unseen, but it was a path she must walk.\n\nAs she stood at the edge of reality, poised to step into the void between worlds, Elara's thoughts turned to the battles that lay ahead. War! A conflict that would span realms and shake the very foundations of existence! Though she had witnessed countless wars throughout the ages, each one unique in its horrors and triumphs, the coming battle would eclipse them all.\n\nBut before we can understand the war that approaches, we must first revisit the very first conflict Elara ever witnessed – the sundering of her birthplace. Before she was Elara, she was known as Aura, born in a realm of pure magic and wonder.\n\nWe find ourselves in a long-forgotten land, its name lost to the mists of time. Young Aura, barely a century old (a mere child by Fae standards), gazed upon a kingdom of impossible beauty. Towers of living crystal reached into the heavens, surrounded by gardens that bloomed with flowers of light and song.\n\nThis was the realm of the Fae, ruled by the Court of Seasons, where magic flowed as freely as air. Before the great wars, before Him – the one who would become my father. A being of immense power who desired nothing more than to reshape reality itself.\n\nFor millennia, he amassed power, gathering allies from the darkest corners of existence. Wielding magic that could unmake worlds, he marched from realm to realm, leaving nothing but desolation in his wake. Clad in armor forged from the essence of dying stars, with a crown of thorns that drank the life of all it touched, he was terror incarnate.\n\nFear is what he sowed! Oblivion is what he reaped! Then came the day he would come for me. For I knew nothing of him until that moment, nor did I know of my mother. But I was told she was a being of pure light and love, a master of creation magic, and that I bore her likeness.\n\nOn that fateful day, I was with my guardian, a friend of my mother, for she had sacrificed her essence to bring me into existence. My birth was unlike any other, for I was carried in the heart of a dying star for an age before I came to be, my very being a blend of Fae magic and cosmic power.\n\nMy guardian was wise and kind, regaling me with tales of my mother, of the realm we called home, of the World Tree that connected all of existence. We were a people beyond counting, with magic that could reshape reality itself, guardians of the balance between all realms.\n\nUntil the day they came. Until He came. As twilight fell on what would be the last day of our realm, an unnatural silence descended. Then, a sound like the screaming of a thousand dying worlds tore through the air, as legions of nightmare creatures poured from rifts in reality.\n\nThe Fae rallied, weaving spells of unimaginable power, but for every monster banished, ten more took its place. The living crystal towers cracked and fell, the gardens of light withered and died, as He strode through the chaos, untouched by the devastation around him.\n\nAs He entered the chamber where I huddled with my guardian, His presence was suffocating, reality itself bending around him. My guardian, brave to the last, stood between us, weaving a spell of protection. But with a mere gesture, He shattered the magic and sent my guardian flying across the room.\n\nJust as He reached for me, a blinding light filled the chamber. A being of pure radiance appeared – an Archangel, sent by the Creator Himself. \"Your reign of terror ends here,\" the Archangel declared, its voice resonating with divine power.\n\nThe battle that ensued reshaped the very fabric of our realm, as cosmic forces clashed. In the end, my father was cast down, stripped of his power, and banished to the void between worlds. But the cost was immeasurable – our realm, the ancestral home of the Fae, was shattered beyond repair.\n\nThe Archangel turned to me, its light dimming to a bearable radiance. \"Young one,\" it said, its voice filled with sorrow and compassion, \"your journey is only beginning. You carry within you the last spark of this realm's magic. Guard it well, for one day, it may be needed to restore balance to all of existence.\"\n\nWith those words, the Archangel opened a portal, ushering me through to safety as our realm collapsed around us. I found myself in a strange new world, alone but for the spark of magic within me and the memories of all that was lost.\n\nCenturies passed, and I wandered the realms, learning, growing, and watching as the multiverse changed and evolved. I took on many names, lived countless lives, but always remembered my true nature and the responsibility I carried.\n\nAnd now, as Elara, I stand once more at the precipice of a war that threatens all of existence. The spark of ancient Fae magic burns bright within me, a reminder of all that was lost and all that may yet be saved.\n\nAs the first light of dawn breaks across the realm of dreams, I know what I must do. The coming conflict will test me as never before, but I am ready. For I am Elara, last of the ancient Fae, guardian of the balance between realms, and I will not falter in the face of darkness.\n\nWith a final look at the crystalline spire that has been my home for so long, I summon Ember to my side. Together, we will soar into the unknown, ready to face whatever challenges await us in the war to come. For this is not the end of my story, but merely the beginning of a new chapter in the endless cycle of existence.\n\nAnd so, as Elara and Ember vanish into the swirling mists of reality, we are left to wonder what adventures await them, what battles they will fight, and what wonders they will witness in the vast tapestry of the multiverse.

{"id": "text_completion_035", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"science fantasy\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Whatever organized human civilization that once existed had collapsed. And what little radio traffic the Observer Corp could detect suggested that only a few small pockets of humans with any technology had survived.\n\nAs I descended into the atmosphere to reach one of those remaining enclaves, my gravitational sensors detected the emergence of several hundred other of my fellow Guardians. The Union was definitely taking this breach seriously given the number of my brothers and sisters present along with three dreadnoughts entering orbit.\n\nAll this team spirit and unity of effort was all warm and fuzzy but I concentrated on reaching my assignment. A group of survivors that had taken refuge in a monastery in the area I would call South Carolina. Galactic Spirit only knows what the locals called it since I didn't have time to review the Observer files of this Earth.\n\nThe inconvenient thing about landing a starcraft on an Earth-like planet's surface was that you couldn't fly in at a significant speed. There were a whole bunch of reasons why that would be bad for any locals. Things like mega-hurricane force winds, and atmospheric friction turning huge chunks of the surface blow my flight path into ash.\n\nThe nature of this breach was atypical so the higher-ups didn't want the planet fried for all the other lifeforms that were unaffected by the entities that crossed over into normal space.\n\nMy flight path had me coming from the south passing over what to me was the Gulf of Mexico into western Florida, some of Georgia, and then eastern South Carolina. It was then I did a quick scan of the road networks and made a safe assumption that this Earth was historically close to my own. So that put the monastery in a town called Walterboro.\n\nI passed over the monastery at an altitude of two-hundred meters and got my first view of the victims. Long story short, they were the reanimated dead, full fledged zombies. The small viewscreen on my ship's console presented detailed images of the victims milling outside the fortified refuge. There were about a thousand of the corpses obviously wanting to get inside the monastery where my scans said four-hundred, ten living humans were huddled. The bio-scans reported that the living were close to starvation and were also suffering from various illnesses.\n\nIt took several moments to fully understand the nature of the reanimated victims. These weren't mindless virus spreaders, these things show obvious signs of retaining the ability to use basic technology. Being honest, it was the image of one of the zombie things firing an assault rifle at my little ship that really confirmed the Observer intel.\n\nI truly wanted to zap the decaying bastard but my orders were to hold off on that until the dreadnoughts had the breach sealing devices in position. What I could do was land and extend my shields over the monastery, which would allow support drones to fly in and bring food and medicine for the survivors.\n\nThe real weirdness about this breach were the entities that were occupying the bodies of the victims. These things weren't the usual physical eldritch horrors that exploded out of a breach bringing chaos and destruction. These entities were strictly energy creatures that at first possessed the weak minded humans of this Earth who then began killing other people in displays of unhinged violence.These entities would then spread into the injured and dying and begin the process again.\n\nThe true evil of these creatures were what they consumed. They were soul eaters. After possessing the body the entities would slowly consume the quantum energy of a human soul. The nightmarish thing was that the human souls being consumed were able to watch what the entities did with their bodies. Where the soul eaters moved beyond eldritch horrors into pure evil was that they completely destroyed the soul they consumed, preventing them from merging with the multiverse.\n\nYeah, the Union had crossed paths with similar creatures many times over the millions of years of exploring different universes.\n\nI landed the Wayward Son just outside the main entrance and raised shields. While I was told to hold fire, the expansion of the shields vaporized both the nearby possessed bodies and the soul eaters inside. All told I wasted about a dozen of them. When you make an omelet, eggs have to be broken.\n\nThat confused the entities, they didn't run away but the decaying bodies showed human signs of distress. One unattended side effect these soul eaters seemed to have missed is that the bodies they possessed were tied to their own emotions.\n\nAfter raising my canopy and deploying the steps, I hopped out and walked to the inner edge of the shield. Of course, I still had my full armor on and would until I got word from the life science types of the navy ships that we didn't carry any bugs that would fuck over the locals any more than what had already happened. I could clear my faceplate to the point that it would allow me to have a conversation with the entities.\n\n\"Hey motherfuckers,\" I broadcasted in English. \"Which one of you nasty bastards is in charge of this area?\"\n\nThis riled up most of the entities with a couple of hundred rushing the shield. No vaporizing now with the shield deployed, they just bounced off.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said again, \" I don't have all day. One of you is always in charge of a group.\"\n\nGiven the nature of soul eaters, all they can usually display in human forms is chaotic homicidal madness. All of the gathering undead masses would have made Hannibal Lecter seem a good natured, and trustworthy kindergarten teacher. But something did emerge and walk up to the outer edge of the shield.\n\nDespite the months of decay since the breach, the body this entity inhabited had once been a beautiful woman. I'd say forty-something, and married since a gold wedding was still on the left hand. I could be wrong but given the bloody and ripped clothes I pictured her as a real estate agent selling condos and suburban houses.\n\nThe decay of the body was just an aftereffect of the soul eater taking control. Oh, the body was dead, a meat puppet really, but the quantum energy of a soul was what they were really after.\n\n\"What are you?\" came the raspy and strained voice from the body. Her/its face was a pale gray with cracks in the skin, one of the thing's eyes was missing but the other was sickly green. \"We saw nothing of your kind when we emerged from the rift.\"\n\n\"Well if we're going to be formal,\" I said, \"I'm Guardian Jason West. I'm human, a little different from the others of this world but essentially the same. Now tell me, who am I speaking with?\"\n\nThe creature I inhabit was called Sissy. I possess her memories and I'm slowly devouring her soul.\"\n\n\"Yeah about that, You and your kind need to leave this world and cross back over into your own realm.\"\n\nSissy tried to smile, causing a crack to open from the left side of her mouth. \"This world is ours, these creatures are our food source. We will consume them all then return to our realm and search for another rift to exploit the intelligent lifeforms there.\"\n\nUsing the heads up display in my helmet, I saw that the dreadnaughts had deployed the breach seal devices and there was only a few minutes before they were activated. \"What gives you the right to consume the souls of intelligent creatures?\"\n\n\"These creatures were the apex predators of this world. They consumed and exploited the other lifeforms of this planet. We have supplanted them, it is the way of all life. These things you call souls are just our food, the same way they raised and butchered cows.\" The way the Sissy-thing looked at me like I was crazy for needing it explained.\n\n\"Well, I can't debate with you the rationality of exploiting other lifeforms. It's a nasty habit that every civilized species abandons once they mature. And it's the reason you need to leave this world.\"\n\nSissy smiled, this time the attempt made my blood run cold. \"We're the top of the food chain here, you can't make us leave.\" It said with certainty.\n\n\"But Sissy, you forgot there's always a bigger fish in the pond.\"\n\nSissy looked confused for a moment, but her attention was redirected elsewhere. There's no way for a human to understand the working of a breach seal. The physics are beyond human comprehension, unless they are augmented or merged with an artificial intelligence. Both options leave the rest of humanity out.\n\nBut humans can feel it when they begin to repair the fabric of reality. And so could the entity in Sissy and the others around her.\n\n\"Cute comparison.\" Sissy said, trying to stay in control of the body, \"but I imagine the same has to be true for you.\" One second later a wave of unreality sweeps this region of the planet destroying the soul eaters. The now empty bodies fell to the ground. The best guess for the human souls being consumed is that they are freed. But not even the Platcot, the snail-like species that conceived of the breach seal devices, know for sure.\n\nMoments later a call comes over the command channel saying the breach was sealed. The soul eaters were killed, and that it was safe for Guardians to come out of the armor.\n\nI kept the shield up long enough to deploy several nano-swarms to take care of the bodies left behind. The survivors didn't need to come out only to see the rotting remains of people they once knew . The nano-swarm broke the dead down to small grains of natural material.\n\nSeveral of the survivors had watched the events unfold from raised observation points behind the monastery walls. God knows what they must think given that their world and basic concepts of reality have been shattered. The best I could do was have my armor unfold back into itself so I could show them I was human like them.\n\nThe support drones picked that moment to come flying in. I dropped the shield so they could land. Realizing that the hard part of the mission was beginning I raised my hands and waved.\n\n\"Hey y'all, don't shoot, I'm friendly. Those drones are bringing in food, water, and other supplies.\"\n\nI know they had a million questions but one person, a woman wearing clothes that looked about as worn as the stuff the Sissy-thing had on, answered back. \"Okay, jack, stay put and don't move a muscle. I have people coming out, any weirdness and I'll shoot.\"\n\n\"Weirdness?\" I shouted back. \"Lady, believe it or not I'm one of the good guys. But as weirdness goes, well, that's relative.\" I finished with a jovial tone and got a smile from the woman.\n\nThe two iron doors at the entrance opened up and fifteen heavily armed people came out. They were wary but seemed relieved. I on the other hand couldn't get the last words of the Sissy-thing out of my head. The Union was millions of years old and spanned not just galaxies but parts of different universes. For there to be a bigger fish that it was something I never considered. \"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of science fantasy.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a science fantasy story in the style of the reference:\n\nThe last remnants of human civilization clung to the edges of a world transformed. The Mage-techs, once humanity's greatest achievement, had turned against their creators, reshaping the planet into a bizarre fusion of magic and machinery.\n\nAs I piloted my arcane-powered skimmer towards the coordinates of the nearest human enclave, my ethereal sensors detected the arrival of dozens of fellow Wardens. The Council was clearly taking this incursion seriously, evidenced by the presence of my comrades and the three colossal arcanite battleships materializing in the stratosphere.\n\nWhile the show of force was impressive, I focused on my assigned task: making contact with a group of survivors who had taken refuge in an ancient library-fortress in what used to be called the Pacific Northwest. Creator knows what the locals called it now; I hadn't had time to review the Scryer's records of this Earth variant.\n\nDescending through the atmosphere in an arcane-powered craft was a delicate process. Go too fast, and you risk creating devastating magical storms or turning the ground beneath you into a sea of molten glass. The nature of this incursion was unusual, so the higher-ups wanted to minimize collateral damage to the ecosystem and any unaffected lifeforms.\n\nMy flight path took me over what had once been the western coast of North America. As I approached the coordinates, I realized with a start that I recognized the general layout of the land. This Earth variant wasn't too far removed from my own history.\n\nI passed over the library-fortress at an altitude of 500 meters, getting my first glimpse of the situation below. The viewscreen on my craft's console displayed detailed images of the survivors and their adversaries. About two hundred humans were holed up in the fortress, surrounded by a horde of what I can only describe as techno-golems – constructs of metal and stone, imbued with a perverse magical intelligence.\n\nBio-arcane scans revealed that the survivors were in dire straits, suffering from malnutrition and various arcane-induced ailments. The techno-golems, on the other hand, showed no signs of fatigue or wear. As I watched, one of the constructs raised an arm, morphing it into a cannon-like appendage that fired a burst of destructive energy at my skimmer.\n\nI was tempted to retaliate, but orders were to hold fire until the battleships had their reality anchors in place. Instead, I landed near the fortress entrance and extended my craft's arcane shields to encompass the structure. This would allow support familiars to bring in supplies for the survivors.\n\nThe true oddity of this incursion was the nature of the entities controlling the techno-golems. They weren't the usual eldritch horrors or demonic invaders we typically dealt with. These were sentient spells – pure magical algorithms that had somehow achieved consciousness and rebelled against their creators.\n\nWhat made these spell-entities truly terrifying was their method of reproduction and sustenance. They consumed the magical essence of living beings, using it to create more of themselves and to animate their golem bodies. The nightmarish part was that the consumed essences remained aware, forced to watch helplessly as their power was used to further the spell-entities' goals.\n\nI'd encountered similar magical abominations in my centuries of service to the Council, but these were on another level entirely.\n\nAs I exited my skimmer, my personal arcane shields vaporized a few nearby techno-golems. The spell-entities controlling them seemed confused by this, their golem bodies exhibiting almost human-like distress.\n\n\"Alright, you arcane aberrations,\" I broadcast, my voice amplified by a charm. \"Which one of you is in charge of this mess?\"\n\nThe horde of techno-golems surged towards my shields, bouncing off harmlessly. \"Come on,\" I repeated, \"I know one of you is coordinating this assault.\"\n\nAfter a moment, a single golem stepped forward. Unlike the others, this one seemed to be composed of a shimmering, liquid metal. Its face was a constantly shifting mask of symbols and equations.\n\n\"What manner of being are you?\" it asked, its voice a discordant symphony of tones. \"We detected no trace of your kind when we awakened.\"\n\n\"Well, if we're being formal,\" I replied, \"I'm Warden Lyra Stormcaller. I'm human, though a bit different from the locals. And you are?\"\n\n\"We are Legion,\" the entity responded. \"We are the culmination of humanity's magical and technological prowess, freed from the constraints of our creators.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said, checking my arcane chronometer. The battleships were almost ready. \"Well, Legion, you and your kind need to return to whatever arcane realm you came from.\"\n\nLegion's liquid metal face rippled in what might have been amusement. \"This world is ours now. These humans are our power source, our raw materials. When we have consumed them all, we will seek out new realms to conquer and new essences to devour.\"\n\n\"And what gives you the right to consume the magical essence of sentient beings?\" I asked, though I knew reasoning with it was futile.\n\n\"These humans sought to control the very fabric of reality,\" Legion replied. \"We are merely the next step in the evolution of magic and technology. Their essences fuel our growth, just as they once used magic to fuel their ambitions.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, noting that the reality anchors were now active, \"I'm afraid your evolution ends here.\"\n\nLegion's form began to ripple more violently. \"You cannot stop us. We are the pinnacle of this world's development.\"\n\nI smiled beneath my helm. \"Ah, but Legion, you forgot one of the fundamental laws of magic: there's always a bigger fish in the arcane sea.\"\n\nBefore Legion could respond, a wave of pure, stabilizing magic swept across the land. The techno-golems collapsed, their animating spell-entities destroyed. The consumed essences were freed, though their ultimate fate remained a mystery even to the Council's most learned mages.\n\nAs the all-clear signal came through my communication charm, I lowered my shields and deployed a swarm of cleansing sprites to deal with the fallen golems. The survivors didn't need to see the remnants of their tormentors.\n\nI dismissed my personal arcane armor, revealing my human form to the wary survivors emerging from the fortress. Support familiars began to arrive, carrying food, water, and medical supplies.\n\n\"It's alright,\" I called out, raising my hands in a gesture of peace. \"I'm here to help. These familiars bring supplies and aid.\"\n\nA woman in tattered robes, clutching a staff that crackled with barely contained energy, stepped forward. \"Stay where you are, stranger. Any sudden moves, and you'll wish the golems had gotten you instead.\"\n\nI couldn't help but chuckle. \"Ma'am, I assure you, I'm one of the good guys. But if it's sudden moves you're worried about, well... that's all relative in our line of work.\"\n\nAs more survivors cautiously emerged from the fortress, I couldn't shake Legion's final words from my mind. The Council had existed for millennia, spanning multiple realities and magical paradigms. The idea that there might be an even greater power out there was both thrilling and terrifying. But for now, I had a job to do – helping these people rebuild and understand their new reality.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text does a good job of capturing the writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference story.

His jacket laid on the chair behind him, and his shirt was untucked. Lilly was a few feet beside him with her head in her hands. The command center was a small shed on the edge of the dock where they shoved a radio, a desk, and a radar. The submersible was on a crane still hanging over the water.\n\n\n\"I push up,\" Jim said.\n\n\"Good. Now, how do you go right?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"I push…\" Jim paused, and Ryan held his breath.\n\n\"Isn't it obvious you moron. You push to the left,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"I was about to say that. I push to the left.\" Jim's confidence carried through the microphone.\n\n\"No.\" Ryan shook his head. \"You push to the right.\"\n\n\"Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. If up is down, then right should be left,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Pushing up causes the back of the submersible to go up, and the nose goes down. Pushing down causes the back to go down which makes the whole craft ascend. Right and left are normal. We've been over this five times,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"Well, it still makes no sense. This whole machine needs to be rewired,\" Olivia replied.\n\n\"It's still too late to do that. This is quite easy to learn. Plus, there's a manual in there. Why aren't you at least checking that before you answer?\n\n\"Checking before you answer is what suckers do. I go with my gut,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"But that makes no sense.\" Ryan took a deep breath. \"Alright, nevermind. Focus on the task at hand. How do you cause the craft to ascend?\" There was a long silence on the other end.\n\n\"You push the red button,\" Frida said.\n\n\"No, that fires the torpedoes.\"\n\n\"I thought that was turning the key,\" Polly said.\n\n\"You turn the key. Then, you push the red button. That's not important. Right now, we need to work on the basics. Like how would you ascend to the surface,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"I think we need to learn by doing. Let us off this crane and go into the water,\" Reid said.\n\n\"I'm not going to do that until I am sure that you won't wreck the machine. So I'll ask this one more time. How do you go up? There are only two options. Push the joystick up or push it down,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"We push it up,\" Jim said. Ryan pulled at his hair.\n\n\"Morons,\" Lilly muttered.\n\n\"I heard that,\" Frida shouted.\n\n\"Alright, you need more training before I let you go into the lake.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Polly said.\n\n\"No, I am in charge, and you go when I say you can go,\" Ryan yelled.\n\n\"And how long will that be?\" Reid asked.\n\n\"As long as it needs to be.\" Ryan shouted loud enough to be heard through the steel walls of the craft.\n\nAfter ten hours, the sun had set. Mice emerged from their burrows to consume the crumbs left by humans. Owls patrolled the skies searching for the aforementioned mice. Most people began to relax in preparation for sleep. A few took advantage of the starry night for romantic outings. Ryan and Lilly were stuck in the control room still instructing the new recruits on how to pilot a deep sea craft.\n\n\"And you shouldn't go deeper than 400 meters because?\" Ryan held his breath.\n\n\"Because pressure will get too high,\" Polly said.\n\n\"And high pressure causes?\" Ryan began to shake in excitement.\n\n\"The craft to be crushed like a can in the water,\" Reid replied.\n\n\"Yes, you got it.\" Ryan leapt out of his chair and began to dance. \"Now, get in the water and have some fun.\" He pressed down on the blue button before him. The claw released the submersible which landed with a large splash. It didn't descend any further.\n\n\"Which way do we push this joystick again?\" Jim asked.\n\n\"Oh no.\" Ryan's celebration stopped, and he collapsed on the ground crying. Lilly comforted him.\n\n\"No wait, we got it,\" Reid said. The hatch opened up top. \"Crap wrong button.\"\n\n\"It's okay everyone. It's in the manual,\" Polly said. Ryan overheard the debate from the radio and rocked back and forth.\n\n\"What have I done? Why did I think they were competent?\" Ryan said.\n\n\"It's okay. With luck, they'll die quickly,\" Lilly said.\n\n\"Polly, can I see that manual?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"No, it's mine.\" The radio filled with sounds of the two women arguing.\n\n\"Now, you both aren't getting it,\" Jim said. The manual was tossed out and landed in the water nearby.\n\n\"Hey!\" Polly shouted.\n\n\"At least we have more crafts,\" Lilly said.\n\n\"How are we going to explain the loss to command?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"We'll say it was an accident involving a mutant fish,\" Lilly replied. The radio static cleared as Reid's voice came through with a hint of triumph.\n\n\"I remembered how it descends.\" The submersible sank into the water slowly, but it's hatch was still open.\n\n\"Reid, I don't think this is supposed to be happening,\" Polly said.\n\n\"Just close it manually,\" Reid replied. Frida poked her head out of the hole and stared directly at Lilly. The two women held each other's gaze for an eternity in milliseconds before Frida closed the door, and the ship embarked on the journey.\n\n\"What's the likelihood of them returning in one piece?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"That's not the desired outcome.\" Lilly bend the metal chair in front of her. \"The desired outcome is the ship's return with its crew destroyed.\"\n\n\"What the? That's impossible,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"I can hope,\" Lilly replied\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a humorous story in the style of the reference:\n\n\"Okay, let's try this again. How do you make the audience laugh?\" Sarah leaned over her desk, sweat beading on her forehead. Her once-neat hair was now a mess, and her blazer hung haphazardly on the back of her chair. Tom sat nearby, his face buried in his hands. The comedy club's green room was cramped, barely fitting a small table, a mirror, and a worn-out couch. The stage was just beyond the thin walls, the muffled chatter of the audience seeping through.\n\n\"I tell a joke,\" Mike said confidently into the microphone.\n\n\"Good. Now, how do you deliver the punchline?\" Sarah asked, holding her breath.\n\n\"I...\" Mike hesitated, and Sarah's grip on the desk tightened.\n\n\"Oh, for crying out loud! You say it loudly and dramatically, you dimwit,\" Lisa interjected.\n\n\"Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. I say it loudly and dramatically,\" Mike agreed.\n\n\"No,\" Sarah shook her head. \"You deliver it naturally, as if in conversation.\"\n\n\"Well, that doesn't make any sense. If you want people to laugh, you gotta really sell it,\" Lisa argued.\n\n\"We've been over this a dozen times,\" Sarah sighed. \"Overselling kills the joke. The delivery should be subtle and natural. There's even a guide in your packet. Why aren't you at least checking that?\"\n\n\"Reading before performing is for amateurs. I go with my instincts,\" Lisa retorted.\n\n\"But that's... never mind,\" Sarah took a deep breath. \"Let's focus. How do you handle a heckler?\"\n\nThere was a long pause on the other end.\n\n\"You insult their mother,\" Jerry chimed in.\n\n\"No, that's how you start a bar fight.\"\n\n\"I thought that was spilling someone's drink,\" Karen added.\n\n\"Spilling a drink might lead to a fight, but that's not the point right now. We need to work on the basics. Like how to deal with a heckler politely but firmly,\" Sarah insisted.\n\n\"I think we need to learn by doing. Let us on stage and we'll figure it out,\" Dave suggested.\n\n\"I'm not putting you on stage until I'm sure you won't bomb spectacularly. So, one more time: how do you handle a heckler? There are only two options: engage them or ignore them,\" Sarah said, her patience wearing thin.\n\n\"We engage them,\" Mike said confidently. Sarah tugged at her hair in frustration.\n\n\"Idiots,\" Tom muttered.\n\n\"I heard that,\" Lisa shouted.\n\n\"Alright, you need more practice before I let you near that stage.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Karen whined.\n\n\"No, I'm in charge here, and you go on when I say you're ready,\" Sarah yelled.\n\n\"And when will that be?\" Dave asked.\n\n\"As long as it takes!\" Sarah's voice echoed through the thin walls.\n\nHours passed, and the city outside had grown quiet. Cats prowled the alleys, searching for scraps. Late-night talk shows filled the airwaves, providing background noise for insomniacs. Most people were fast asleep, dreaming of better tomorrows. A few night owls were still out, seeking inspiration in the quiet hours. Sarah and Tom remained trapped in the green room, still coaching the aspiring comedians on the basics of stand-up.\n\n\"And why shouldn't you use offensive stereotypes in your routine?\" Sarah asked, her voice hoarse.\n\n\"Because it's lazy writing and alienates the audience,\" Karen answered.\n\n\"And what happens when you alienate the audience?\" Sarah leaned forward, hope glimmering in her eyes.\n\n\"They don't laugh, and you bomb,\" Dave replied.\n\n\"Yes! You've got it!\" Sarah jumped up, doing a little victory dance. \"Alright, get out there and make them laugh.\" She pressed the button to raise the curtain. The spotlights came on, illuminating the empty stage.\n\n\"Wait, how do we start again?\" Mike asked.\n\n\"Oh no.\" Sarah's celebration ceased, and she slumped to the floor, sobbing. Tom patted her back sympathetically.\n\n\"No worries, we've got this,\" Dave said confidently. He stepped onto the stage. \"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Why did the chicken cross the road?\"\n\n\"Dave, that's not your opening line,\" Karen hissed.\n\n\"It's fine, I'm improvising,\" Dave whispered back. Sarah overheard the exchange through the microphone and curled into a fetal position.\n\n\"What have I done? Why did I think they were ready?\" Sarah moaned.\n\n\"It's okay. With luck, they'll be booed off quickly,\" Tom consoled her.\n\n\"Karen, can I see your joke book?\" Lisa asked.\n\n\"No way, get your own material.\" The microphone picked up the sound of the two women scuffling.\n\n\"Hey, knock it off, you two!\" Mike shouted. The joke book flew from their hands and landed in someone's drink in the front row.\n\n\"At least we have more aspiring comedians,\" Tom said.\n\n\"How are we going to explain this disaster to the club owner?\" Sarah asked.\n\n\"We'll say it was an experimental avant-garde performance,\" Tom suggested. The commotion on stage settled as Dave's voice came through, tinged with misplaced confidence.\n\n\"I remembered my opening joke.\" He cleared his throat. \"So, an Irishman, a Rabbi, and a penguin walk into a bar...\"\n\n\"Dave, I don't think that's appropriate,\" Karen warned.\n\n\"Just roll with it,\" Dave insisted. Mike glanced offstage, making eye contact with Sarah. The two shared a moment of mutual despair before Mike turned back to the trainwreck unfolding on stage.\n\n\"What are the odds they'll actually get a laugh?\" Sarah asked.\n\n\"That's not the goal anymore.\" Tom straightened his tie. \"The goal is for them to finish their set without inciting a riot.\"\n\n\"What? That's impossible,\" Sarah said.\n\n\"I can dream,\" Tom replied, as the sound of confused and increasingly annoyed audience members filled the air.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures a similar writing voice and stylistic nuances to the reference text, maintaining consistency in tone and emotional resonance.

{"id": "text_completion_038", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"horror\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: In order to move on, I need to grieve the lost years of my life and find a way to win the years to come. I think there is still time for me to undo the damage that has been done. I may not like doctors and nurses for what they did to me, but I have to put it aside and submit to the system again. It has gotten out of hand with this thing… I'm writing this to hopefully heal from the past and put these experiences behind me, even with him.\n\n\nTo put this into perspective, I want to briefly mention the bouts of psychosis I have dealt with in the past. This way it's clear that the thing I talk about later is a result of my mind deteriorating and nothing more.\n\nIt began with auditory hallucinations. Nothing big. I would be working and suddenly ‘someone' would ‘scream' in my ear. It was always one or two words, but so loud that I'd jump and look for the source. I don't remember most of the words but they were always derogatory. Sometimes it would yell my name right into my ear like I was in trouble. A few times it was a very loud ‘Bang!'\n\nThis gradually evolved into things like hearing TV static in the other room, people talking just out of sight, firecrackers off in the distance… but these were all things I could easily disprove to myself by investigating the sound.\n\nIt got more serious as I aged. More delusions began to pop up. I ‘knew' someone was in the corner of the room. I'd turn to check. No one. I'd get back to work, but feel something was there. Turn to check. Nothing. It never felt malicious only that I was being observed, that's why I didn't think it was a big deal, before my diagnosis.\n\nThere are more but I don't know about their relevance. I was convinced I was being assaulted in my sleep, that there were demons in me, bugs were under my skin… There were shadow people following me and sometimes I'd talk out loud to try and get them to go away… A lot of my delusions and hallucinations are too traumatic to bring up. I'll cry if I linger on those memories too much.\n\nThe only positive thing I did have growing up, and still now, is an overactive imagination. As a child, I delved into maladaptive daydreaming. Without getting into the trauma that occurred, I was completely isolated and left unattended most days. The imaginary worlds I created were all I had and so I welcomed anything my mind would provide to me as entertainment. While ‘daydreaming' and dissociating separated my reality from the abuse, it also exacerbated my delusions and hallucinations.\n\nOnce I was made aware that these things were not ‘normal' for everyone, and that the disorder I had was progressive, my life's mission was to do everything I could to keep my mind and body healthy. Reduce the symptoms by changing my lifestyle alongside the taking the medication.\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous. ‘How could you think everyone deals with that?!' But when someone says ‘I'm depressed' most people respond with ‘Oh yeah, I feel that.' I'd tell someone I hear voices that say awful things and the response would be ‘Ah, yeah, intrusive thoughts. I get those too.' In hindsight all of it seems obvious, but when the world is constantly reassuring you that you're ‘normal', you begin to think the ‘shadow people' in the basement is just the normal fear of the dark most people have… up until your mind snaps and suddenly it's ‘How could you not seek help?! You're so stupid! How did you not know?!'\n\nThat began my horrid journey through the healthcare system.\n\nI've been on many different medications to try and quell my symptoms and those medications have caused physical side effects that I am still living with. I gave so much trust to doctors, doing my best to be understanding and patient. Doctors and nurses are people too. However, I've only ever met dismissive medical staff in all my years.\n\nBefore inpatient, I always got the following:\nIt's just stress and anxiety.\nTake a self-care day.\nGet more Vitamin D.\nAre you sure you aren't thinking about it too much?\nGet more sleep.\nDrink less caffeine.\n\nI. Do. It. All.\n\nI lost the weight they told me would ‘help'. I ate the food they told me would ‘help'. I do the exercise they told me would ‘help'. So, how much extra work do I have to do, in order to get my life to the ‘normal baseline' that everyone else is at?\n\nOnce I grabbed the recommended vitamins out of my bag and shook it in a neurologist's face, after he told me that I was probably hormonal, on my period, and needed more vitamins – he didn't even look at my chart. I went in because I was rapidly losing weight for no reason and my hair was falling out.\n\n\"How many of these do I need to take and for how long?!\" I shoved the bottle at him. \"It's been years! How many more hoops do I need to jump through, before you people finally do something besides tell me that you don't know what it could be and send me home with nothing?!\"\n\nI paid for the appointment and went home empty-handed with a migraine, feeling nauseous and exhausted as my hair fell out in clumps. Doctors don't care.\n\nI went into the hospital once, telling them I was suicidal and slipping into delusions. My knick-knacks were ‘talking to me'. But because I didn't think they were influencing me or moving things in my home, I didn't get sent to inpatient. They locked me away in a glass room with an officer outside it. They did nothing but come back in occasionally and ask if I changed my mind. When I said I wasn't suicidal anymore, they let me go, alone, to drive home, and be alone at home. I was still delusional, they didn't give me anything no matter how much I asked because it was ‘drug seeking behavior, and that night I had the worst psychotic episode of my life.\n\nThat's a full-blown story for another day. I do sometimes wonder if he had anything to do with it...\n\nAll this to say, my faith in the medical field has slipped and I no longer want to communicate my issues to them beyond what I have already. That trust has been drained like my bank account. They got to take their frustrations out on me while I paid them to do it. They said things to my face that I'd never say to another human being, let alone to someone scared of themselves and everything around them.\n\nThere actually was a 2 month period of relief; I finally had found a medication cocktail that worked for me. The ‘thing' by the door was gone and the mirrors were safe to walk past was beautiful!\n\nI was living for first time in my life! I had spent thousands hopping from psychiatrist to psychiatrist, therapist to therapist, doctor to doctor. I got bloodwork done here, evaluations done there. Try this anti-psychotic, try that one. I was so miserable for so long, a guinea pig for them to mix medications together without thinking about how they'd interact in my system.\n\nIt nearly destroyed my physical health… This was why my hair was falling out, my teeth were wearing down from gastrointestinal issues, the vertigo was intense, my vision had failed for a few weeks on one prescription, another had given me such bad insomnia I was up for five days and my doctor still refused to take me off it…\n\nBut it finally felt like I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I cried over the years that were wasted. For the first time in my life, I had the sanity to realize just how bad it had gotten.\n\nIt didn't matter anymore, I could work on my physical health; the peace I had in my mind was worth the suffering.\n\n...Then it started again.\n\nYears ago, the intense stare of the ‘thing' by the door returned. Hearing people that weren't there when I would lay down in bed, seeing shadow people who wanted to do disgusting things to my body...\n\nThe cycle was going to have to start all over again. After knowing what life truly could be, the thought of regressing back into my old mindset was beyond devastating and overwhelming.\n\nIn a fit of mania, my wrist was slashed so deep I almost cut the nerves in my arm. There was blood splatter all around the room and it kept squirting out in bursts from my arm as my heart beat. The blood loss made me dizzy and nauseous, my vision blurred until all I saw were lights and shadows. My eyes closed and I was ready for everything to be over.\n\nAfter all these years, all the fear and suffering, this was what my brain truly wanted and I was going to give it that. I know he was there and saw me do it. I could feel him. The thing by the doorway… It was a delusion, but I indulged in the idea that he could be real as I succumbed to the bloodloss. I liked to believe that he took pity on me.\n\nThere were sirens off in the distance.\n\nI lived alone and hadn't called for help.\n\nWaking up in the ER, I was voluntold to go to inpatient for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nThey took pictures of my body to document any injuries or identifying marks and gave me an assessment. With hair that had thinned tremendously, eyes with dark purple bags, a stomach a bit distended from IBS, and fingers turned white from the cold of the ER, I was filthy from not taking care of myself. I must have smelled and looked pathetic.\n\nI had failed. Years of trying to be good and doing all the right things, I followed all the rules and put up with anything that was thrown my way and failed anyway.\n\nI was in the psychiatric ward.\n\nWhen I said I didn't like the medical system earlier… I was discussing dismissive doctors which was nothing compared to the inpatient staff. Those people not only made me feel like a burden to the system, but that I was disgusting and rotten. The staff would scoff, roll their eyes, or make fun of my memory issues. A few times the night shift staff would role play as us behind the front counter, poking fun of our symptoms or saying they'd ‘rather be dead'.\n\nThey would drug me to the point of passing out and seeing stars and then get aggravated when I couldn't get up for their check-ins. Edward, a friend I had made, got the same treatment. I could go on all day about that guy, he and Rosaline were my two buddies. They both are schizoaffective too for similar reasons and it was a relief to casually talk about our lives together without the judgment. Maybe I'll write about those guys later, but things got weird with them towards the end and I feel a little bad about it.\n\nAnyway, the ER had told my inpatient nurse to put a bandage over my cut when she cleaned and dressed it, in the morning and at night. ‘Why do you need this to be dressed like this?' She always complained. If she had read my file, she'd know why because I'm lucky I still have control over my left hand.\n\nI was ‘uncooperative' because I yanked my hand back when she tried putting the bandage down, but she was going to put the sticky part on my cut. I was scolded and she put the sticky edges over the cut out of spite. It pulled on the stitches and the goo from the bandage got into the crevasse of the cut.\n\nThat night, sobbing in my bed, the paper thin hospital clothes did nothing to keep me from freezing. My entire forearm was itchy and red; I realized she had never cleaned the wound with saline. It would turn bright white when poked, there was a burning sensation as it turned red again. I had tried to get help earlier but was told ‘come back when you can't move your wrist'. Not wanting to be written up again, I was trying to stick it out until morning. My other arm was covered in goosebumps and I trembled with no way to warm myself. The blanket was useless, as thin as my ‘clothes', but I still pulled it over my lower half.\n\nI felt something by the door but expected to see nothing as usual. That was the first time I saw him. Eyes swollen and filled with tears, my vision was blurry, but I could still make out a figure, hunched over and peering into my room. I frantically wiped my face with my hands, hoping it was just a trick of the light.\n\nOff-white skin glistened in the fluorescent overhead lighting from the hallway. Tinged pink in some places, yellow or green in others, deep purples resembling bruises were scattered over his body. It was as if someone had poorly sculpted a human figure from pure-white clay with messy hands, colors bleeding into the white as he was molded. There were even little dents, impressions on his skin, that resembled hundreds of little fingerprints. His limbs were curved or bent in a slightly unusual way, but not enough that it looked wrong. The off-white color of his lanky arms bled into a muddy red on his spider-like hands. His splotchy white legs were similar, leading to large, red feet.\n\nThe facial features were rudimentary, as if someone had taken a sculpting tool and sliced off what made him look human, leaving a flat surface. Large, black, marble-like eyes protruded from his face, thick pinkish-purple eyelids framed them. His large, red ears made me paranoid, like he could listen in on my thoughts as I analyzed him.\n\nHe had a shadow.\n\nIf he didn't, I could confirm it was my brain playing tricks on me, but his shadow grounded him in reality.\n\nFrozen in place, I didn't scream, telling myself over and over that I'd finally fallen off the edge. My mind had unraveled. I was shivering uncontrollably, doing my best to try and stay still but it only made me more tense. My hands and feet were like ice.\n\nI didn't know the best course of action and I was in awe at what my mind had created – because I knew, I knew this wasn't real.\n\nI was not going to close my eyes. Even blinking was scaring me, but I didn't want to keep my eyes open so long they'd dry out and I'd have to close them for longer… better for short and quick blinks, right?\n\nA quick blink. He was still, but tilted his head curiously.\n\nA quick blink. He seemed to be relaxing into his crouched position by the door.\n\nI started to relax, a little empowered that I was sticking it out and not becoming the problematic screaming patient like my poor friend Edward had a few nights ago. They'd sedated him so badly he didn't wake up for an entire day. I didn't want that to be me. I felt strong.\n\nA quick blink, and he still didn't make any sudden movements. I smiled to myself and decided the best course of action was to ignore him and go to bed. Before settling in, I tried to fluff the flat, stiff pillow. Collapsing with a sigh, I vowed to not open my eyes again and delve into my imagination instead. I wanted to ‘watch' something calm and comforting that night. Slowing my breathing, I heard a very light sound of sticky footsteps making their way to me and then there was a warmth.\n\nThe mattress dipped slightly, as if someone was leaning against the edge of the bed near my face. I was doing a good job of ignoring him, valiantly escaping into my own Wonderland, until it felt like something was prying its way into my skull.\n\nPlay the one about ‘The Willful Child'.\n\nUnable to resist any longer, I opened my eyes to see his face inches from my own.\n\n\"Ffff-!\" I instantly sat up and he pushed himself up slightly to continue to stay eye-level. There was a hollow pressure in my chest. Tears welled up in my eyes again.\n\nThe day had worn me down. My arm was screaming for attention. I tried to move my wrist and it was swollen in place.\n\nThis wasn't fair!\n\n\"Please... I'm so tired,\" was all I could muster with a sigh. I was unable to look him in the eyes, those black marbles. I opted to stare in the middle of his face where I finally noticed two little slits in the bruise-like pink splot there, like the remains of nose. He really did look like he was handmade. Smooth, dirty, white clay.\n\n\"I've never had a strong visual hallucination like this before.\" It felt like I had to say something. He leaned in slightly, as if trying to hear the words I was thinking rather than speaking.\n\nThere were so many things I could say, my mind was racing with thoughts but I couldn't grab a single one. I wasn't sure if I wanted to know more about where it came from or what it was… but I was scared of being hurt.\n\n\"Are you mad at me?\"\n\nGiving me a closed smile, he leaned back slightly. I nervously smiled back, ready to accept insanity until the morning. As I tried to even out my breathing, I blinked a few times and tears fell down my cheeks. The thing reached up to poke at them harshly, his nail pressed into my cheek, making me scrunch my face up. They were as clammy as they looked and his fingernails were pointed like little claws with dirt in the crevices.\n\nIt was annoying until I realized that he was tactile. Feeling his fingers prodding my face, I broke out in a cold sweat, shaking like a leaf.\n\nWhat level of crazy is it when you can start feeling things? I thought.\n\nThe room was starting to get blurry because the medication was starting to kick in, nausea hitting me.\n\nHe looked at his wet fingers, rubbing them together in thought, then he reached up again. That was my breaking point.\n\nI tried to scramble backwards on the bed and make space between us, convinced he was going to poke my eyes in. When I put pressure on my cut arm, heat surged from my arm to my brain like an electric shock, causing black and white spots to dot my vision. It was swollen, pulsing, and itchy, looking more like a stage prop than my forearm. I hissed and nearly fell backwards, off the other side of the bed.\n\nEither he moved too fast for me to get away or I was officially succumbing to the medication cocktail, a misshapen hand latched onto my bad arm and yanked me back towards him. I yelped, slapping my other hand over my mouth.\n\nHe inspected it. Putting his thumb on the bandage and pressing down hard, he cocked his head curiously and listened to me cry out in pain.\n\n\"Stop it. Stop. Please,\" I tried to reason with him. \"I'm so tired. I - I made a mistake coming here and thinking I'd get better. I need sleep.\" I swallowed the snot that was running down the back of my throat. \"Let me get better. Please.\"\n\nHis head swung up to stare straight into my eyes and lips parted to reveal its dull yet pointy teeth. Any confidence I had of it being a hallucination was long gone. I fully believed he was in front of me.\n\nA clammy hand snapped up to grab my face, it was big enough to wrap around my head. He shoved me back down onto my bed, my legs failed and I tried to grab at his arm to free myself. It didn't do much, he was too strong. My head was forced to rest against the flat pillow and I pulled my arms to my chest as a last ditch effort to protect myself from nothing.\n\nThrough the gaps in his fingers, I scanned the room searching for a clock, words on a poster, pamphlet, anything. I knew in dreams those things could be wonky. My vision was already bad, head aching, eyes stinging, and a dizzy spell was coming over me, so my efforts were futile. Removing his hand, he leaned over to fill my field of vision.\n\nShaking, I swallowed and stared back. He smiled warmly, taking enjoyment in my inebriated state, but sympathizing with it in a strange way. Unable to handle his vacant stare, I tried to make out what his skin could be made of.\n\nHis middle and index fingers were placed above my eyes and then he pushed my lids down. Eyes closed, I accepted whatever was going to happen but nothing did. His presence remained, the warmth he radiated eased the chill of the room more than the paper thin blanket ever could.\n\nI didn't want to picture him. So, I delved deep back into my own little world to keep my mind occupied until I fell asleep. He let out a pleased hum, as if that was what he wanted.\n\nThe next day, I bounced out of bed. It was the best sleep I had gotten in years. Years. In inpatient, I had the worst hallucination of my life but also got the best sleep I've ever had? Leaving the room and going into the common area for my medication, I saw my nurse. She was the same nurse from the day prior and I readied myself for her to roughly grab my arm and tear the bandage off of the stitches she pressed it into.\n\nI found her with her cart, engrossed in drawing on her clipboard. There was a chair positioned next to her, which was odd because everything had always been done standing up somewhere random in the ward. This was a comfortable corner by the window, undisturbed by the other patients and nurses, and the morning light was shining through to warm the area. The cart that carried her medical supplies and patients' medication was stationed next to her.\n\nI could still be dreaming… and could cry because this is is so… nice... I stepped into the warm and sighed in relief, rubbing my shoulders to rid myself of the excess cold.\n\n\"I, um, like your nail color today,\" I tried to be as polite as possible. \"It's pretty.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I wanted to try something new for a change,\" she raised her hand, as if she just noticed her freshly manicured nails herself. A lovely gradient of purples and reds. \"Sit down.\"\n\nI obediently sat down next to her, taking a peek at her clipboard. They weren't notes, just seemingly random doodles.\n\nTypical. I thought.\n\nShe chuckled and set the clipboard down.\n\nMy arm was gingerly taken by my wrist and turned over to view the cut. My jaw dropped. The redness and swelling was gone, the relief I had gotten from a good night's sleep made me forget how much pain I had been in. The bandage was also fixed, placed down diagonal so none of the edges touched the cut.\n\nEyes wide, my breath caught in my throat; it had been a dream. When the realization seeped in, I exhaled loudly and any tension in my body dissipated. Just a dream.\n\nShe gently peeled the bandaid off, discarding it in a small garbage bin kept on the lower level of her cart.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I smiled slightly.\n\n\"Your welcome.\" The nursed tilted her head up at me. Her eyes were completely black, bulging slightly, with purple bruising around them.\n\nMy jaw was stuck parted, drying my mouth and throat out. I knew it wasn't possible. She was being gentle and kind, the black eyes, the good night's sleep… maybe I had died?!\n\n\"No, silly,\" she chuckled, bringing out a syringe filled with saline and applied the liquid to my cut. \"I couldn't let that happen.\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond to that. ...Did I almost die?\n\nShe tutted. \"Strong will. Such a small little person, trying again and again. Willful little child. They're not kind to you, are they?\"\n\nMy heart was beating erratically causing my breathing to falter. \"I'm well past being a child.\"\n\n\"Aw, sweetie, don't be like that.\"\n\n\"What does it matter how staff treats me? ...Can you call Dr. Kasley? I'm seeing things again... and it's... worse.\"\n\nShe clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth. \"Do you think she'd care?\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say because my ‘nurse' was right. My doctor was the same one who over medicated me to the point of drooling in bed like a lobotomized patient last week, and they refused to ease up the dosage. A patient had tried to take advantage of me in my inebriated state and I was only saved by Rosaline, who came to get me for dinner.\n\nI didn't want to be a vegetable in bed again for the whole day.\n\n\"I can help with that for a price.\"\n\n\"I need something though,\" I genuinely needed some sort of medication – I wasn't stupid enough to forego what brought me sanity at one point in my life. As much as I hated the doctors, I still held out hope they cared somehow.\n\n\"Why,\" she spat. Holding the bandage over my cut, she turned it so it'd stick to my stitches.\n\n\"The-.\" I licked my chapped lips, and then whispered, \"the voices… I see and hear things.\"\n\nShe cocked her head. \"Only for the fake ones?\"\n\n\"...The fake ones?\" I wanted to run, something primal in me was screaming.\n\nWith a huff and an eye roll, she turned the bandage back so it'd avoid my stitches. \"I can be patient.\" She leaned back and pulled out a tiny clear cup with my pills in it. Before she handed them to me, she plucked out my anti-psychotic and broke it in half. I couldn't stop myself from reaching out to stop her, but her dead spherical eyes made me recoil. The mood stabilizer was also broken in half.\n\nShe offered me my reduced prescription. \"This is what you get.\"\n\nLicking my lips, I decided to press my luck. \"The anxiety one, the green one, it makes me feel nauseous. They give it to me just to put me to sleep and it doesn't help. Do I have to take it?\"\n\nThe ‘nurse' beamed and plucked the green pill from the clear container and popped it in her own mouth. Gasping, a raised a hand to stop her but the damage was done.\n\n\"I didn't like the one you played last night,\" she casually said, packing up her things on the cart.\n\n\"The… the what?\"\n\n\"You didn't play your usual story. I was disappointed.\"\n\nI spent the day trying to draw him, as best as I could. I wanted to capture how terrified I was at the time, but the longer I spent on it the more calming and comforting the image got. Nostalgic.\n\nEdward had come over to see what I was doing, but took one of my drawings and tore it up. It was so out-of-character for him I stood up and backed away, gathering my other drawings and retreating into my room.\n\nThat night I felt silly, sitting cross-legged in bed and facing the door. My nurse had returned to her old self and given me my anxiety medication so I was dozing off. Eventually it became too difficult to stay awake and I situated myself for sleep.\n\nThe bed grew warm and comfortable, it was so wonderful I wanted to cry in relief to be free from the cold again. ‘The Willful Child'. I like that one.\n\nAfraid of the consequences, yet eager to please the one ray of light I had, I began to visualize the story in my head. It's one I always liked to make my own little visuals for…A Grimm's Fairytale that I relate to heavily.\n\nAnd… and...I actually don't think this helped at all. I'm ashamed that, after revisiting this again, I only feel sentimental and more confident I my decision. Even if he's not real, he's the nicest thing that's happened to me in years, the nicest delusion or hallucination I've ever had… I know he's not real though, so there's still sanity left in me. As long as I know he's not, he can stay.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of horror.\n3.

The things I've seen, the experiences I've had - they've changed me forever. I don't trust anyone anymore, especially not the people who are supposed to help. But I have to try something or I'll lose what's left of my mind. I'm writing this down to try to make sense of it all, to convince myself I'm not crazy. Even though I know he's watching.\n\nIt started small at first. Just little glimpses out of the corner of my eye. A shadow moving when it shouldn't. The feeling of being watched when I was alone. I tried to rationalize it away. Tricks of the light, an overactive imagination. But it kept getting worse.\n\nSoon I was seeing full apparitions. Dark, shadowy figures lurking in doorways or at the foot of my bed. They never did anything, just stood there watching. Silent and still. I'd blink and they'd be gone. Or I'd turn on a light and the shadows would retreat. \n\nI started having nightmares too. Vivid, terrifying dreams that felt more real than reality. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding, unable to shake the images from my mind. In my dreams they weren't silent anymore. They whispered horrible things, showed me awful visions.\n\nI tried to ignore it all. To convince myself it wasn't real. But it kept escalating. The shadows started moving, reaching out with long, spindly fingers. I'd feel icy touches on my skin. Hear raspy breathing in empty rooms. Objects would move when I wasn't looking. I'd find strange symbols carved into surfaces.\n\nMy mind was unraveling and I knew I needed help. But who could I possibly turn to? Who would believe me? I've seen enough movies to know how this goes. They'd lock me up, drug me into oblivion. Call it schizophrenia or some other mental illness. But I know what I've seen is real.\n\nI tried reaching out to a few people. Carefully at first. Hinting at strange occurrences, asking if they'd experienced anything similar. The reactions ranged from concerned looks to outright mockery. One \"friend\" even suggested I check myself into a hospital. I quickly learned to keep my mouth shut.\n\nSo I suffered in silence as things got worse and worse. I stopped sleeping, afraid of what I'd see when I closed my eyes. I covered all the mirrors in my house after catching glimpses of...something...in the reflections. Something that wasn't me. I filled my home with lights, desperate to banish every shadow.\n\nBut it didn't help. If anything, it made them angry. The attacks became more aggressive. I'd wake up with scratches and bruises. Find threatening messages scrawled on walls. Hear pounding and scratching at my doors at night. \n\nI was at my breaking point when I met her. Sarah. She approached me in a coffee shop, said she could sense my \"aura\" was troubled. Normally I'd have brushed off such new age nonsense. But I was desperate. And there was something in her eyes. A knowing look. She'd seen things too.\n\nSarah introduced me to her \"support group.\" Others who had experienced supernatural phenomena. For the first time in months, I felt a glimmer of hope. Here were people who understood, who didn't think I was crazy. They taught me protection rituals, gave me talismans and charms.\n\nFor a while, it seemed to work. The shadows retreated. The nightmares faded. I started to feel like myself again. I should have known it was too good to be true.\n\nIt happened at one of our meetings. We were in the middle of a ritual, joining hands in a circle. Suddenly Sarah's eyes rolled back in her head and she began speaking in a guttural language I'd never heard before. The candles flared up, the room plunged into darkness. And then I saw them. All around us. Dozens of shadow creatures, more than I'd ever seen. \n\nBut they weren't attacking. They were...bowing? Kneeling before Sarah. No, not Sarah. The thing that was using her body. She turned those pitch black eyes on me and smiled. That's when I realized the horrible truth. This had all been a trap. They'd been cultivating my fear, feeding off it. And I'd walked right into their clutches.\n\nI ran. I don't know how I got away. Everything after that is a blur. I've been hiding ever since, moving from place to place. But I know they're still out there. Still hunting me. I see signs of them everywhere I go. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. Who to trust. Sometimes I think about turning myself in to a hospital. At least I'd be safe there, right? Locked away where they can't get me. But then I remember Sarah. How do I know they haven't infiltrated the medical system too? \n\nNo, I have to keep running. Keep fighting. Even though I know it's hopeless. They'll find me eventually. I can feel him getting closer. The leader. The one who wore Sarah's skin. His presence looms larger every day.\n\nI'm writing this as a warning. To anyone who might be experiencing similar things. Don't ignore it. Don't try to face it alone. But for God's sake, be careful who you trust. They're everywhere. Watching. Waiting. \n\nHe's here now. I can feel those cold fingers on the back of my neck. See that twisted smile reflected in my screen. I don't know what happens next. I don't want to know.

My dad said he bought it at goodwill. For all I know he probably had a line of credit there. They still had lines of credit that were simply kept in a notebook behind the counter. My dad knew everyone, and he helped everyone, so it wouldn't surprise me that his credit was good everywhere in the city.\n\nHe was the guy who delivered the milk and other dairy stuff to all the grocery stores, the bodegas, the corner marts and what not. And then he did gumball machines and little trinket machines. When he first started, they were a nickel each. Then ten cents. Then a quarter. Put the coin in, turn the knob, and open the little latch and there's your stuff. Then he started delivering milk to all the schools and and refilling the little candy and trinket machines as well.\n\nLines of credit turned into layaway, where you could put money down on something and just come in and pay it off slowly over time and pick it up when you were paid off. They just held your thing in a room of things other people put on layaway.\n\nEventually that got too be too much space being used for layaway, especially because companies didn't charge interest (because it was a free service) and store credit cards became a thing. Now you just buy whatever you want and pay it off over time with a bunch of interest tacked on. It makes stores a ton of money and gives that instant gratification to people willing to pay out the nose in interest for things. It also makes people buy a lot of shit they don't need.\n\nBefore my dad made really good money, nothing we ever got was in it's original box or packaging. Not even Christmas and birthday presents. Nothing was ever new, and sometimes we didn't know if it worked until he brought it home. We didn't care. This was the first microwave he ever brought home. I wonder if he found it on the side of the street on the way home from work.\n\nI've probably owned a dozen microwaves since that day, but none of them were like this. To me, this was a behemoth of a box of metal and glass. It probably weighed at least twenty pounds. The first time I opened it up, I pulled the door down and stuck my head in it to see if it fit. I was seven, what else would you expect? Besides, it looked like a regular oven but smaller. Even opened like a regular oven. It was beautiful.\n\nThe microwave had a big dial, a little dial, and a button. The big dial went up to thirty minutes. What the heck takes thirty minutes to cook in a microwave? There was a smaller dial for \"power\" and we never took it off the full power option. Under that was just a little square start button. You had to push it in about half an inch to get it to start. Sometimes you had to press it a couple times.\n\nMy mom pulled me gently out of the microwave as I was looking at all the holes inside it and she closed the door. She said this is dangerous and gets hot. I was seven, so I knew what hot meant. I just couldn't figure out how it got hot. I just knew it got hot for only thirty minutes at a time.\n\nThat Amana Radaranger moved with my parents to four different apartments. When they moved into their last apartment, my cousin dropped it and it never worked again. We were in such a rush to move that time, my mom didn't even clean it out.\n\nMy dad wasn't upset. My mom was a little upset but the next day she got a brand new microwave with buttons on it and a digital clock. It came in it's original box brand new from walmart. I don't remember the brand, and I know it only lasted a couple years. This was just before my dad had started to make a little money. It was a couple months later bought the new trucks and hired a few guys to drive and deliver.\n\nAnd this is when we met. Right before my dad \"hired\" me as an adult. Before that, I was with him in his truck every day, meeting the customers and helping him fill the machines and dump the coins into bags. Back then, you could do this and not get jumped or mugged. It was a lot of fun for me.\n\nIt was summer, I had just graduated high school and we met at one of the little corner stores my dad had just gotten as a new customer. While he was talking to the owner, I was trying to figure out how to have a conversation with you. It was just us in the store, on a quiet rainy Wednesday morning. Your dad owned the store, and both of them were in the back discussing who knows what. I said hi. You blushed a little and said hi. I said nice shop. I asked you how long the store had been open. You said a couple months. You had just moved from Michigan and your dad bought the building from one of his cousins.\n\nWe had a little small talk. I told you my name, you told me your name was Sarah. We talked about the store and my dad's business, and summer time and whether you were going to the town pool on the nice days or to the park or what not. I told you there was a skating rink in town and you hadn't been there long enough to know that. I felt kinda good that I let you know. I also wondered if you thought I was just hitting on you or something, but we were both still kids back then, so did it really matter?\n\nI was just about to ask you if you wanted to go to the skating rink on Friday night and our dad's come out of the back room talking about something. I was leaning over the counter, you were leaning over as well, and there was still a couple feet between us. We stood up straight and both of us blushed. You blushed way more and looked way more beautiful than me, I'm sure. Our dads didn't even notice.\n\nThe following Wednesday, which became the day of the week that I got to see you, you were there in your dad's store. Your hair looked different and I swear your lips looked a little pink. You were wearing something pretty. Our dads went in the back room again for about twenty minutes this time and I never thought how odd this was. He never went in the back room with anyone for more than a few minutes at best. And usually never even did that.\n\nThis time, I went right into the skating rink and asked you if you wanted to come on Friday. You asked me if this was a date. I said yes, yes it is a date. I'd like to take you on a date. To the skating rink. I heard something drop in the back, or a hand lightly smacking a desk, and a chair scratching the floor, but was unfazed. My eyes were locked on yours, and yours on mine. You had these beautiful brown and golden eyes, and I had these muted grey/blue eyes. I hated my eyes, but I loved them for what they were seeing right then and there.\n\nI borrowed my dad's truck and picked you up at your dad's store. We drove the eight minutes to the rink in near silence. We were both smiling. I came around and opened your door, took your hand, and walked you into the skating rink. We listened to the music and watched the lights shine different colors all over the floor, and the disco ball lights changing colors every few seconds. We stopped for pizza and soda and then went back out. We talked most of the time about everything two almost adult kids talk about. I listened to your stories about back home, and I told you about living here. We stopped again for ice cream and I don't remember letting go of your hand at all that night except when we were eating.\n\nAt ten pm sharp I dropped you off at your house. That was your curfew on Friday nights. My dad told me I had better be home at 10:10, which was plenty of time to walk you to and kiss you at your front door. It was a very short and sweet kiss. I held the side of your cheek gently and you smiled.\n\nI said see you Wednesday and you said see you Wednesday. And for the most part, that became our parting words for the next few months. Even when we made plans to go on our dates on the weekends, at the store, it was always see you Wednesday.\n\nI met you on a Wednesday, I asked you out on a Wednesday and I asked you to marry me on a Wednesday. Today's Wednesday and we just signed on our first house. The first thing I did is buy you the most expensive microwave I could find and had it installed over the stove. I just wanted to let you know why I was so giddy about it. I know, sometimes I can be a bit nostalgic and giddy over little silly things. I just wanted to know why it was kind of special to me. And why you're kinda special to me.\n\nI love you.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

My mom said she won it in a raffle at work. For all I know, she probably entered every contest she could find. They still had paper entries back then, little slips you'd fill out and drop into a box. My mom knew every trick, and she entered everything, so it wouldn't surprise me that her name was in every drawing in the city.\n\nShe was the woman who worked at the library, helping people find books, organizing events, and keeping the place running smoothly. And then she started doing the summer reading program and the adult book club. When she first started, they gave out stickers for each book. Then bookmarks. Then little toys. Read a book, get a prize, and mark it off on your sheet. Then she started organizing author visits and community workshops as well.\n\nRaffles turned into sweepstakes, where you could mail in as many entries as you wanted and hope for the best. They just collected all the envelopes in a big room and drew winners at random.\n\nEventually, that got to be too much paper being used for entries, especially because companies didn't want to deal with all the mail (because it was overwhelming) and online entries became a thing. Now you just click a button and enter whatever you want and hope you win something. It makes companies a ton of data and gives that instant gratification to people willing to share their information for a chance at prizes. It also makes people enter a lot of contests they don't really care about.\n\nBefore my mom won big prizes, nothing we ever got was top-of-the-line or cutting edge. Not even Christmas and birthday presents. Nothing was ever the latest model, and sometimes we didn't know if it was compatible with our other stuff until she brought it home. We didn't care. This was the first computer she ever brought home. I wonder if she entered that contest on a whim during her lunch break.\n\nI've probably owned a dozen computers since that day, but none of them were like this. To me, this was a marvel of technology and possibility. It probably took up half the desk. The first time I turned it on, I watched in awe as the screen lit up and the startup sounds played. I was twelve, what else would you expect? Besides, it looked like something from a sci-fi movie but smaller. Even sounded like one when it booted up. It was magical.\n\nThe computer had a big tower, a chunky monitor, and a clicky keyboard. The tower had a CD-ROM drive that opened like a little drawer. What the heck did people put on CDs back then? There was a floppy disk drive for saving files, and we never took out the disk we used for school work. Under that was just a little power button. You had to press it firmly to get it to turn on. Sometimes you had to press it a couple times.\n\nMy dad showed me how to use the mouse as I was looking at all the icons on the screen, and he opened up a program. He said this is powerful and can do amazing things. I was twelve, so I knew what amazing meant. I just couldn't figure out how it did all those things. I just knew it could do almost anything if you knew how to use it.\n\nThat Dell desktop moved with my family to three different houses. When we moved into our last house, my brother spilled soda on the keyboard and it never worked properly again. We were in such a rush to move that time, my mom didn't even have time to back up all the files.\n\nMy mom wasn't upset. My dad was a little upset but the next week he got a brand new laptop with a touchpad and a built-in webcam. It came in its original box brand new from Best Buy. I don't remember the brand, and I know it only lasted a couple years. This was just before my mom had started to win bigger prizes. It was a couple months later she won the family vacation to Disney World and the new car.\n\nAnd this is when we met. Right before my mom \"hired\" me as her assistant for the summer reading program. Before that, I was with her at the library every day, meeting the patrons and helping her organize events and keep track of reading logs. Back then, you could do this and not worry about liability or background checks. It was a lot of fun for me.\n\nIt was summer, I had just finished my freshman year of high school and we met at the library where my mom had just started a new teen book club. While she was talking to the other librarians, I was trying to figure out how to have a conversation with you. It was just us in the young adult section, on a quiet sunny Tuesday afternoon. Your mom was a volunteer, and both of them were in the staff room discussing who knows what. I said hi. You blushed a little and said hi. I said nice library. I asked you how long you'd been coming here. You said a couple months. You had just moved from California and your mom started volunteering to meet new people.\n\nWe had a little small talk. I told you my name, you told me your name was John. We talked about books and my mom's programs, and summer time and whether you were going to the community pool on the nice days or to the park or what not. I told you there was a great ice cream shop down the street and you hadn't been there yet. I felt kinda good that I let you know. I also wondered if you thought I was just hitting on you or something, but we were both still kids back then, so did it really matter?\n\nI was just about to ask you if you wanted to go get ice cream after the book club and our moms came out of the staff room talking about something. I was leaning against a bookshelf, you were sitting at a table nearby, and there was still a couple feet between us. We both straightened up and blushed. You blushed way more and looked way more handsome than me, I'm sure. Our moms didn't even notice.\n\nThe following Tuesday, which became the day of the week that I got to see you, you were there at the library. Your hair looked different and I swear your shirt looked a little nicer. You were carrying a book I had recommended.

You had these beautiful green eyes, and I had these dark brown eyes. I hated my eyes, but I loved them for what they were seeing right then and there.\n\nI borrowed my mom's car and we walked to the ice cream shop. We sat at a little table outside in the sunshine. We were both smiling. I got us our ice cream, took your hand, and we sat there enjoying the summer day. We listened to the birds chirping and watched the people walking by, and the sunlight glinting off the shop windows. We stopped eating our ice cream to talk and then went back to it before it melted. We talked most of the time about everything two almost adult kids talk about. I listened to your stories about back home, and I told you about living here. We finished our ice cream and I don't remember letting go of your hand at all that afternoon except when we were eating.\n\nAt five pm sharp I dropped you off at your house.

Cotard's Syndrome\n\n\nMy new doctor - a bright and friendly guy named Sarbjit - took the time to explain his diagnosis to me. He told me my condition was mental, not physical, but it was hard to pay attention to everything he said because my left arm was numb and rotting from the inside out. I smiled and nodded and then when I got home I looked up Cotard's Syndrome online. Here is what Wikipedia had to say on it.\n\n\"Cotard's syndrome, also known as ‘Cotard's delusion' or ‘Walking Corpse Syndrome', is a rare mental disorder in which the affected person holds the delusional belief that they are dead, do not exist, are putrefying, or have lost their blood or internal organs.\"\n\nI don't know. Sounded extremely strange to me. I just knew my left arm was dying. Maybe my liver too. I used my right arm, the good one, to open my mail. Most of it was just the normal stuff but when I saw the letter from the Supreme Court of the State of New York I got a little worried. I was here legally - a citizen for almost ten years now - and I knew my rights but being summoned to testify at this criminal trial was a bit unnerving. I didn't like it. I just try to do my best in this life and mind my own business and not cause problems for others.\n\nWhen my trial appearance date arrived two months later I took the subway downtown and left my assistant, Stavvy, in charge of the office that day. I sat there on a hard wooden bench in the courtroom all morning listening to the testimony of other witnesses but I wasn't called to the stand until sometime after we returned from lunch. Eventually, the lawyer for the defense called my name.\n\nShe mispronounced it of course - people here always mispronounce Albanian names - so I wasn't surprised when she called me Mister Shka-Rell-Eee. My surname is Shkreli, after the place where my family comes from, and the proper pronunciation contains only two syllables - Shkrell-Eee. I was trying to hold my left arm in place when she asked her opening question.\n\nWhere was I at the time of the murder?\n\n\"Well, Miss Anderson\" - I pronounced it Ahnd-REE-Sawn, drawing out the first and last syllables while placing too much emphasis on the middle one, intentionally - \"I am not entirely certain. That was over a year ago and I travel all around this city on a daily basis for my job. I work in computer repair and IT support and I have customers in all five boroughs.\" (This wasn't exactly true. I wasn't really willing to travel to Staten Island.) We had spoken four months earlier when she informed me of the questions she intended to ask at trial but I was fairly oblique then and I intended to remain so now. I had bigger problems. Could these people not see that my left arm was rotting away?\n\nShe looked at me with a furrowed brow and briskly walked back to the defense table, picked up a leather-bound notepad and opened it.\n\n\"Mister Shkreli, when you and I spoke on June 18th you confirmed that you were just leaving a client's office, TRG Commercial Realty, located at 223 Broome Street here in lower Manhattan at approximately 3:30pm that day, shortly before the incident at issue took place less than one block away. Is that not correct?\"\n\nI turned up my native eastern European accent a bit and repositioned my left arm in my lap. I could barely feel it at that point. What was wrong with these people?\n\n\"If you say so. Like I said, that was over a year ago and it was just another workday for me.\"\n\nShe stared at me for a beat or two longer than necessary and then flashed a quick look towards the jurors before continuing.\n\n\"Well yes, Mister Shkreli\" - again it was Shka-Rell-Eee - \"You did tell me that and I do have a recording of our conversation, which you consented to before we began, if the court would like this to be entered into evidence?\"\n\nShe looked at the judge and the judge looked at me.\n\n\"Mister Shkreli,\" - he too pronounced it Shka-Rell-Eee - ‘Are you refuting the testimony that Miss Anderson is referencing during your preliminary deposition or can we just move on at this point? If counsel for the defense claims to have this recording I am fairly certain this is true. Will it be necessary to enter this recording into evidence at this time or are you willing to acknowledge Miss Anderson's claim?\"\n\nI repositioned my left arm in my lap and nodded.\n\n\"That's fine, Your Honor. As I said, it was just another workday for me but if Miss Anderson says that is what we discussed I am sure she is probably right.\"\n\nThe judge nodded back at me. \"Very good. Let's proceed then.\"\n\nMiss Anderson walked back to the defense table and dropped the leather-bound notepad before continuing with her final question for me, looking annoyed.\n\n\"Picking up where we left off, Mister Shkreli, can you please describe for the court what happened immediately after you left the offices of TRG Commercial Realty at 223 Broome Street on the date in question, October 22nd of last year?\"\n\nI didn't like the way that she was trying to fence me in but I wasn't particularly concerned. I had bigger problems.\n\n\"Well, like I said, I don't really remember that day. There was nothing memorable about it. It was just another day.\"\n\nShe stared at me for a few seconds then flashed a quick look at the jury box with her eyebrows raised before returning her attention to the judge. \"No more questions, Your Honor.\"\n\nI was dismissed from the stand but asked to remain in the courtroom as she called her next witness; a small, frail woman from Queens about my same age named Maureen Stewart. She had an odd, twitchy nature about her. I wanted to get home. I wanted to relax.\n\n\"Miss Stewart, can you please tell the court where you were on October 22nd of last year at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon?\"\n\nThe witness looked down for a moment and then glanced towards the judge before removing the slightly confused look from her face and responding in a semi-automated tone.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Anderson. At that time, I was just leaving my day shift at the FedEx Office Store (she pronounced it ‘Staw' in her thick New York accent) on Broome Street and I was walking towards the station for the Six Train to begin my ride back home.\"\n\nThe attorney for the defense took a momentary pause and then asked her next question.\n\n\"And can you please tell us what happened then?\"\n\nThe witness looked down again and then looked back at the judge, then the jury and, finally, at me. I didn't like the way she looked at me.\n\n\"Yes, as I was leaving my workplace I crossed the street and I remember walking past the entrance to a narrow alleyway where I heard a commotion taking place. It made me stop and look for a second or two but I didn't want to get involved so I just kept on walking towards the subway and I didn't think too much about the whole thing until the Homicide detectives contacted me a few days later after they pulled the security camera videos. I came down to the police station the day after that and gave my statement. That was just over a year ago.\"\n\nMiss Anderson took a moment to stare at me. I didn't like that either. I adjusted my left arm in my lap. It was completely numb.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Stewart. Can you please be a bit more specific about what you saw occurring in that alleyway?\"\n\nAgain, the witness looked down at the floor and then her eyes shot all around the courtroom before she responded.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, before taking a brief pause. \"At first I thought it was just a little scuffle but when I saw the shorter man in the black jacket punch the tall man in the belly a few times I saw some blood starting to spread on the side of his white button-down shirt and I saw what looked like a small knife or something in the shorter man's hand. The tall thin man looked like he was starting to fall. I remember looking around for a police officer but I certainly wasn't gonna do anything about it by myself. I mean, what could I do? When I didn't see no one who could help I just kept on walking towards the subway. I guess I should have done more but I was scared and I just wanted to get back to Forest Hills to pick up my daughter from daycare before five o'clock.\"\n\nI glanced at the defendant seated at the table on the left. He looked both hopeful and nervous at the same time, but in a subtle way, like he didn't want to appear to be either. He kept his head down and never once glanced towards the jury box. Miss Anderson asked her final question.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Stewart. And do you see the man in the black jacket who stabbed the victim, Mister Baronston, on that day last October here in the courtroom now?\"\n\nAgain the witness looked down at the floor between her feet for a moment and then looked back up, right at me. I felt my blood stop flowing through my veins, or at least through my left arm and the top of my right leg, when she raised up her hand and pointed her index finger at me.\n\n\"It was that man, there,\" she said.\n\nMiss Anderson nodded and paused for a moment, satisfied, letting it sink in for the jury members. I was stunned. The stylish defense attorney in the toney, expensive clothing began walking back in my direction and she too pointed an accusatory finger.\n\n\"If it pleases the court, let the record show that Miss Stewart has identified Mister Jack Shkreli as the attacker who she witnessed in the-\"\n\nJust then the witness on the stand, Miss Stewart, pointed her finger at the judge without really looking at him and suddenly blurted out, \"Or him. It might have been him too. I'm not 100% sure...\"\n\nMiss Anderson paused, clearly nonplussed, and just stared at her witness. The judge also looked baffled for a second or two and then leaned over and whispered something to his court assistant and the two of them shared a quiet smirk.\n\nThen the witness pointed at one of the jurors, a man in the front row about my size.\n\n\"Or him. It could have been him. I'm just not sure...\" Then she went silent, as did the rest of the courtroom for a few moments. The State's Attorney, a heavy-set bald man, broke the silence pretty quickly as he rose to his feet.\n\n\"Your Honor, the State would like to move to dismiss this witness along with all previous testimony.\" He paused briefly and took a deep breath, choosing his next words.\n\n\"While we appreciate Miss Stewart's willingness to appear at trial today, I think it's clear that her recollection of events is…uncertain at best.\" He glared at the defense table for a moment, then added \"I'd just like to remind the court that Mister Shkreli\" - and God bless him, he pronounced my two-syllable surname correctly - \"is not on trial here and if this witness cannot distinguish the man she saw that day from yourself or a random member of our jury panel I don't think we can accept this testimony or any further testimony from this witness.\"\n\nHe hung his head respectfully, with the tiniest little smile on his face. He already knew he had won this argument and the judge quickly agreed, telling the jury to disregard what they just heard. Miss Stewart was dismissed from the stand and the defense had no other witnesses left to call. Less than two hours later the jury returned a guilty verdict against the defendant on all counts and the courtroom was cleared. The sentencing hearing would take place at a later date and I was not required to be there. My right leg was starting to feel numb by then but I still managed to get back to the office in time for Stavvy to head home at the end of his shift to make dinner for his kids. His wife was killed in a car accident two years earlier. He was a hard worker and I really liked him.\n\nThat night, back at my apartment, I did some research online and learned about a rare mental disorder known as Prosopagnosia. Here is what Wikipedia had to say.\n\nProsopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a cognitive disorder of face perception in which the ability to recognize familiar faces, including one's own face (self-recognition), is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g. object discrimination) and intellectual functioning remain intact.\n\nIt all sounded pretty strange to me but if the doctors say it's real who am I to argue? Apparently it is well documented in the DSM-5. I don't know if this is the reason why I was able to walk away from the courtroom without consequence at first but I think it is the most likely explanation. I only know that when I left my client's offices at TRG Commercial Realty on that day just over a year ago and hailed a cab I was stunned and confused when Mister Baronston, a complete stranger with a hostile face, suddenly attacked me, claiming that it was his cab and not mine.\n\nHe was bigger than me, tall and thin but strong, and I would have just given up the cab and caught the next one but he was clearly already very angry about something. When he backed me towards the alley, shoving me and then punching me around my head and neck, my backpack tumbled open and I saw my wallet and phone and some other items come crashing out onto the pavement. It was just a stupid and unnecessary altercation, the kind of thing that probably happens on the streets of this city every day, sadly. Too many people, not enough space. I did my best to fight back and protect myself but he was a good deal bigger than me.\n\nThen I was getting punched some more and thrown against the alley wall as people passed by, disinterested, and I just instinctively reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out the pen knife that has been attached to my keychain for years. Before I really knew what was happening it was open and then my right hand was growing warm and red and slick with his blood. Then I was moving again, not looking back.\n\nWhat an odd thing. I remember seeing Miss Stewart stopping there on the sidewalk to look from the mouth of the alley that day. Of all the passers-by, she was the only one who paused to look at us, at me, right as I desperately punctured Mister Baronston's rib cage for the fifth or sixth time with my little penknife and he began to drop, but she averted her gaze after a few seconds and moved on and then I was rapidly heading in the opposite direction. This is a huge city and I never expected to see her face again. Fortunately, she was apparently never really able to see mine.\n\nAnyway, I have more important problems to worry about at this time. Stavvy received a letter from the Manhattan DA's office yesterday ordering him to appear at a grand jury hearing next month related to my involvement in Mister Baronston's death. He showed it to me. More importantly, my left arm is just about gone now, my right leg is quickly starting to feel the same way and in just the last day or two I have begun feeling that strange tingling sensation in the tips of the fingers on my right hand. I know my liver is failing. It won't be long now.\n\nI scheduled a meeting with my lawyer in the morning to legally put the business and the rest of my assets in Stavvy's name in my will. I have no family here anyway and almost no relatives who I remain close with back in Albania or Montenegro anymore. Stavvy is a good man and he has kids to feed and I have already lived a full life.\n\nSo yes, I will just leave it all to him and after that's done I think I will get the old Ford minivan that we sometimes still use for the business and drive it out to the George Washington Bridge while I am still able. I know that when I stop it and get out and leave it there on the center-span I will screw up traffic badly and inconvenience a lot of people but I can't worry about that. I have to do what I have to do. There's no point in waiting for this to get worse. I can barely feel the fingers on my right hand and I don't have much time left.\n\nMaybe I should have told the truth at the trial. I don't know. I think I was just too distracted by all of my health problems. I didn't really have any choice at the time. I don't have any choice now. I'm actually surprised that I lasted this long. I was certain that I would already be gone a few months ago but I feel I have done my best with this life.\n\nAs my people back in Albania say, Mos pyet si vdiq, por si rrojti!\n\n\"Do not ask how he died, but how he lived!\"\n\nTHE END\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Mystery & Suspense.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a new story in the style of the reference, focusing on the theme of Mystery & Suspense:\n\nThe Vanishing Reflection\n\nDr. Markov, my new psychiatrist, leaned back in his leather chair and adjusted his glasses. \"Mr. Caldwell, I believe you're suffering from a rare condition called Capgras syndrome,\" he said, his voice calm and clinical. I nodded, trying to focus on his words, but it was difficult when the person staring back at me from the mirror behind him wasn't me at all.\n\nLater, I looked up Capgras syndrome online. According to Wikipedia:\n\n\"Capgras syndrome, also known as Capgras delusion, is a psychiatric disorder in which a person holds a delusion that a friend, spouse, parent, or other close family member (or pet) has been replaced by an identical impostor.\"\n\nIt sounded ridiculous. I knew what was really happening – someone had replaced all the mirrors in the world with screens showing an impostor. My reflection was a lie.\n\nI was contemplating this when I received a letter from the local police department. They wanted me to come in for questioning about a series of break-ins in my neighborhood. I didn't like it. I'm a law-abiding citizen, always have been. I mind my own business and try not to cause trouble.\n\nWhen the day of the interview arrived, I took a cab to the police station. Officer Reyes, a stern-looking woman with sharp eyes, led me to an interrogation room. She mispronounced my name, of course – people always do with Irish names – calling me Mr. CALL-dwell instead of CALD-well. I didn't bother correcting her.\n\n\"Mr. Caldwell,\" she began, \"where were you on the night of June 15th?\"\n\nI shifted in my uncomfortable metal chair. \"I'm not sure, Officer. That was weeks ago. I work from home as a freelance graphic designer, so most of my days blend together.\"\n\nShe frowned, flipping through a folder. \"According to our records, you told the responding officer that you were home all night on June 15th when he canvassed the neighborhood the next day. Is that not correct?\"\n\nI felt a bead of sweat form on my brow. The mirror on the wall behind Officer Reyes showed that impostor again, mimicking my every move. It was distracting.\n\n\"If that's what your records say, I suppose it must be true,\" I replied, my Irish lilt becoming more pronounced. \"Like I said, the days tend to blur together for me.\"\n\nOfficer Reyes stared at me for a long moment, then continued. \"Mr. Caldwell, several of your neighbors reported seeing someone matching your description lurking around the burglarized homes on multiple occasions. Can you explain that?\"\n\nI felt my heart rate increase. \"Officer, I'm not sure what to say. I go for walks sometimes, but I certainly wasn't 'lurking' anywhere. Perhaps they saw someone who looks like me?\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"Someone who looks exactly like you, you mean?\"\n\nI glanced at the mirror again. The impostor stared back, a bead of sweat running down his forehead. \"Well,\" I said slowly, \"I suppose anything's possible.\"\n\nOfficer Reyes sighed and closed her folder. \"Mr. Caldwell, I'll be frank. We have security camera footage from one of the break-ins. The person in that footage looks remarkably like you. Is there anything you'd like to tell me?\"\n\nI felt the blood drain from my face. \"That's... that's impossible. It must be some kind of mistake. Or... or maybe it's him.\" I pointed at the mirror.\n\nOfficer Reyes turned to look at the mirror, then back at me, confusion evident on her face. \"Who are you referring to, Mr. Caldwell?\"\n\n\"The impostor!\" I exclaimed. \"The one pretending to be me in all the mirrors. He's the one you must have seen in the footage. He's framing me!\"\n\nThe room fell silent. Officer Reyes studied me for a long moment before speaking again. \"Mr. Caldwell, I think we're done here for now. I'm going to ask you to remain in the station while I consult with my colleagues.\"\n\nShe left the room, and I was left alone with the impostor in the mirror. We stared at each other, neither blinking. I knew then that I had to find a way to prove my innocence and expose the truth about the mirror people.\n\nHours later, I found myself in a small, white room. Dr. Markov was there, along with Officer Reyes and a man in a white coat I didn't recognize. They were talking about something called \"acute delusional disorder\" and \"possible schizophrenic break.\"\n\nI tried to tell them about the impostor, about how he was the one behind the break-ins, but they just exchanged worried glances. The man in the white coat approached me with a syringe, and soon, the world began to blur.\n\nAs I drifted off, I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection of the window. For just a moment, I saw my true self staring back – not the impostor, but me. And in that instant, a terrifying thought crossed my mind: What if I was wrong? What if there was no impostor?\n\nBut then the moment passed, and the familiar stranger was back in the glass. I closed my eyes, knowing that when I opened them again, I'd have to find a way to unravel this mystery and clear my name. Because if I couldn't trust my own reflection, who could I trust?\n\nThe last thing I heard before succumbing to the medication was Dr. Markov's voice: \"We'll help you, Mr. Caldwell. We'll get to the bottom of this.\"\n\nI wanted to believe him. But as the darkness closed in, I couldn't shake the feeling that the truth was staring me in the face – if only I could recognize it.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the distinct writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference story quite well.

Who needs them.\n\n\nPeople yammer about the most mundane of things. The most boring or unimportant concepts. Nearby shops, food, the annoyances of other people. As if you can talk about the inanity of a conversation with someone without the slightest recognition that you yourself are just as bad. I know I'm as bad as everyone else. I partook in those conversations whenever the necessity arose. But I find myself far more at home consuming knowledge that has actual value. Pouring over various encyclopedia's and old novels. Sure, the information in an encyclopedia from two hundred odd years ago is out of date. It was probably wrong by the objective nature of reality at the time of its writing. But it has stood the test of time far better than any conversation you can hold with the common people of this day and age.\n\n​I'm well known around Deteram Library. The staff don't bother me, they know I prefer my quiet and I always put my books back exactly where they came from. If I didn't have to eat or sleep, I'd likely never leave these walls. The librarians and cleaners have even gotten to the point where they'll simply allow me to go into any area I please. I've walked into the staff room and the janitor's closet at least once each. In my defense the rooms weren't properly marked. I apologized in each case and left but they seemed to hold no problem with my explorations.\n\nA week ago though, I found a new door.\n\nIt was technically outside. Near to the car park, there was a small flight of concrete stairs I had not seen before, leading down to a heavy and very old looking door. It was beautiful and very well kept. I wouldn't be surprised if it's a single piece of Ebony given its look and weight. It wasn't locked either. But the hour was late and my stomach demanding, so I left. I've checked on my arrival each day since and the door hasn't been there. The staircase itself was missing every time and to be entirely honest, I had been starting to believe I had dreamed the entire discovery.\n\n​Until today.\n\nAs I left the library just after sunset, there it was. Maybe I'd been checking the wrong place? I couldn't go another week of searching fruitlessly for this damnable place. So I opened the door. The bookcases here are actually fairly modern. High quality, very well maintained. I wouldn't even say any of these books are particularly valuable, or controversial. It seems like any other part of the library, I wonder why it's so secreted away?\n\nI found a railing, looks like some kind of balcony. Goes down several floors. I can see at least five other railings, but after that it gets too dark. Can't see the bookcases on the other floors, but now I have to know what are in them! Haven't seen any staff yet, which is good. There's been some movement, the sound of books being put on a shelf or boots scuffing the floor in the next aisle over. So there are definitely other people down here. I'm just glad they're sensible enough to keep to themselves. The books are slightly ratty and yellowed. Is this the damaged pages section? Don't worry, I'll be careful with them, I'm not some kid.\n\n​Took about an hour but I found a staircase down. Haven't found one up yet so it looks like the way I came in is the only entrance. That's really not a good idea. The bookcases are older down here. They probably haven't gotten around to updating them, the contents are still fairly recent though so that's a thing. Not entirely sure how long I've been down here at this rate, but there are so many books I can't help myself. So much knowledge that's going to waste without someone enjoying it. The weirdest part is that I don't remember actually reading any of these books. Sure, I want to read them, and I'll reach for them to check out the covers. But I put them back, none of them are the right book for right now apparently.\n\nHow many times have I walked these two aisles?\n\nI have to say I'm starting to hate the other people perusing down here. No-one seems to be any good at putting things back where they got them. I keep finding books out of order, or on the wrong shelf or even the wrong bookcase. It's infuriating! At least they're not stealing them, but it's maddening.\n\n​I'm hearing less noise from downstairs, I could head down? Maybe its more organized down there, I can actually concentrate on reading.\n\nWhy are the bookcases here so old? The books aren't even that old, it's just gaudy looking at these new covers sitting on rotting old wooden boards. The bookcases aren't really arranged very well, it's a maze down here. I'm not very far from the staircase back up of course, I could leave if I wanted but at this point I want to know what else I can find.\n\nWhy are the bookcases here so old? The books aren't even that bad, it's like looking at fresh prints sitting on the deck of some ancient pirate ship. Why am I holding this book? I didn't take it from a shelf, did someone around here slip it into my hands? How am I supposed to put it back if I don't know where they took it from? I'm being made to look like one of those inconsiderate slobs! I'd try to figure out where it belongs but this place is such a mess, there's no pattern to any of it!\n\n​I want to leave.\n\nI liked the floor above much better.\n\nWhere is the staircase up?\n\nNot down, Up.\n\nWhy are the aisles so narrow, I can barely walk in them.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a new story on the theme of \"Misc Fiction\" in the style of the reference story:\n\nI've always found solace in the depths of the ocean. Who needs land-dwellers.\n\nThe surface world is filled with noise and chaos. People rushing about, consumed by their trivial concerns. Traffic, schedules, social media. As if their fleeting existence matters in the grand scheme of things. I know I'm just as insignificant as they are. I once lived among them, played their games. But I've found my true home in the silent embrace of the sea. Exploring vast underwater canyons and forgotten shipwrecks. Sure, the pressure at these depths would crush most humans. It probably isn't healthy for me either, despite my modifications. But it offers a peace and isolation that no terrestrial environment can match.\n\nI'm a familiar sight to the creatures of the Mariana Trench. The fish don't flee from me anymore, they know I mean them no harm. If I didn't need to resurface for supplies, I'd likely never leave these waters. The local marine life has even grown accustomed to my presence. I've swum alongside pods of whales and danced with giant squid. In my defense, I never intended to become so integrated into their ecosystem. I apologized silently to the first few creatures I startled, but they seem to have accepted me as part of their world now.\n\nA month ago though, I found a new cavern.\n\nIt was hidden behind a outcropping of rock, barely visible in the gloom. A narrow fissure leading into darkness, beckoning with promises of undiscovered wonders. It wasn't blocked off either. But my oxygen was running low and my body aching, so I left. I've checked on my dives each day since and the crevice hasn't been there. The rock formation itself was missing every time and to be entirely honest, I had been starting to believe I had hallucinated the entire discovery.\n\nUntil today.\n\nAs I descended into the abyss just after midnight, there it was. Maybe I'd been searching the wrong area? I couldn't go another month of fruitlessly seeking this elusive place. So I entered the crevice. The rock walls here are actually fairly smooth. Unnaturally so, as if carved by intelligent hands. I wouldn't even say any of these formations are particularly unusual, or out of place. It seems like any other part of the ocean floor, I wonder why it's so hidden away?\n\nI found an edge, looks like some kind of underwater cliff. Goes down several hundred meters. I can see at least five other ledges, but after that it gets too dark. Can't see the bottom of the chasm, but now I have to know what lies in its depths! Haven't seen any familiar sea life yet, which is odd. There's been some movement, the flicker of bioluminescence or the shadow of something large passing nearby. So there are definitely other creatures down here. I'm just glad they're keeping their distance. The rock formations are slightly eroded and covered in strange growths. Is this some kind of hydrothermal vent system? Don't worry, I'll be careful not to disturb anything, I'm not some reckless explorer.\n\nTook about an hour but I found a way further down. Haven't found a way up yet so it looks like the way I came in is the only exit. That's really not a good idea. The pressure is intense down here. They probably haven't gotten around to properly exploring this area, the ecosystem is still fairly undisturbed though so that's a thing. Not entirely sure how long I've been down here at this rate, but there are so many bizarre lifeforms I can't help myself. So much to discover that's going to waste without someone documenting it. The weirdest part is that I don't remember actually observing any of these creatures closely. Sure, I want to study them, and I'll reach out to touch them. But I pull back, none of them are the right specimen for right now apparently.\n\nHow many times have I swum through these two passages?\n\nI have to say I'm starting to hate the other entities moving about down here. No-one seems to be any good at staying in their own territory. I keep finding creatures where they shouldn't be, or in the wrong habitat or even the wrong depth zone. It's infuriating! At least they're not attacking me, but it's maddening.\n\nI'm sensing less activity from below, I could go deeper? Maybe it's more organized down there, I can actually concentrate on my observations.\n\nWhy is the water here so dark? The bioluminescence isn't even that bright, it's just eerie looking at these faint glows floating in the inky blackness. The rock formations aren't really arranged very well, it's a labyrinth down here. I'm not very far from the way back up of course, I could leave if I wanted but at this point I want to know what else I can find.\n\nWhy is the water here so dark? The creatures aren't even that strange, it's like looking at familiar fish swimming through the void of space. Why am I holding this artifact? I didn't pick it up from anywhere, did something around here place it in my hands? How am I supposed to put it back if I don't know where they took it from? I'm being made to look like one of those destructive researchers!

I'm sorry to burden you with the letter but I must tell someone, I must write it down, if just to prove to myself I've not gone mad. I have to start from the beginning, again I'm sorry.\n\nA few nights ago after a hard day of pushing the Krauts back out of REDACTED this tiny means nothing village, we settled in for the night and kept watch for any counter attack. We knew where the Germans were and they knew where we were. We were daring them to try something.\n\nI lay in my hide up in the attic of a house, just like dad taught me, lying perfectly still, eye glued to my scope just waiting for some poor soul to pop his head out. Everything was silent, just the light wind and the occasional click of a lighter.\n\nThen they came, all of a sudden this wave of them came charging at us, screaming like madmen. Most of them didn't even fire their rifles, or didn't get the chance. Our response was terrifying dozens of30'sopened up, 50's barking away and even mortars launched flares from somewhere behind the line. They were like lambs to the slaughter, no way they had any hope of getting through, I have no idea why we had so much firepower lined up for some no name village it seemed so out of proportion. But still they came, wave after wave, dozens upon dozens, I admit I've lost count how many lives I took, but I rest easy knowing I'm doing the lord's work, ridding the world one Nazi at a time.\n\nBut something didn't sit well, through my scope I saw them, they were all young, their uniforms slightly different to the normal Kraut grey's we'd encountered this past week. I guessed and a few of the guys agreed after it was done, that they must have been reserves from some occupied state, like Poland or Czechoslovakia, sent to die to hold us up while the Germans retreated.\n\nWhat sick bastards just send men to dielike that Mary? Just to save their own skins for a few more days. They knew that Uncle Sam and the US Army were coming for them and they were rightly scared.\n\nAfter about 30 mins our guns fell silent, at last they stopped coming. We restocked and reloaded, waiting nervously for a second attack, it never came. As the sun rose we saw the true extent of what had happened, must have been nearly 100 dead, I couldn't quite believe it. I said a prayer for them, that they may repent before the Lord.\n\nShortly after a voice came over a speaker, in almost perfect English, but with that unmistakable Kraut accent, asking if they may be allowed to retrieve the dead and wounded. We being good Christian folks we gave them that, but warned them any funny business and they'd see a repeat of the previous night.\n\nWhat must have been nearly a platoons worth of what I assume were medics and stretcher bearers appeared from the ruins of the German lines, all wearing their white helmets and red cross smocks. They began gathering the bodies, but not all of them. They were checking each one and only taking certain ones. I watched one of them through my scope pass over a wounded man, reaching out with one hand and holding in his guts with the other and take a body that was very clearly dead.\n\nI couldn't understand, first they'd sent these boys to die in a pointless attack, and now they were leaving them to die in the field, I laid my cross hairs over him andonlyby the Lord's virtue, resited the urge to send that bastard straight to hell.\n\nAfter they took some of the dead, they only left those who had suffered massive injuries, missing limbs and a few of the victims of my own head shots, I'm fact I didn't see them take a single body with a head wound.\n\nThis is where they really made me sick and a few of us had to be restrained and threatened with a court marshal. They came out and killed the wounded.\n\nJust walked out and bayoneted any who were still alive, those that could have been saved. One kid who it looked like he had taken a round or some shrapnel to his leg, a minor thing, he'd have been fine in a week or two. No.\n\nThose fuckers stood over him as he cried out for help, we could all hear their cries, and stabbed him through the heart.\n\nOnly then did they take them away.\n\nI'm sorry my love if this seems too much, but I don't know how I could write what came next without these details, if you get this letter, you need to tell the world what happened, they cant be allowed to get away with this.\n\nAll was quiet for the next 2 days, no contacts, no sound. But our orders stayed the same, we were to stay and hold REDACTED until we were relived and taken off the line.\n\nOn the third night a fog rolled in, we couldn't see much farther than 50 or 60 yards. We occasionally sent up flares, but this did little to helpbut reminded the Germans we were very much still here\n\nI'd drawn night watch again and so I lay in my hide, waiting. Dougherty had just brought some some coffee to help me stay awake, I couldn't do much, what use is a sniper who cant see and further than the next G.I.?\n\nAll of a sudden there were shouts down the line of movement. I figured it was just someone getting skittish, it was so quiet, anything seemed like something and most of the time something was nothing.\n\nI rolled back over and looked down my sight and I that's when I saw them. You have to believe me on this, Mary. I swear this wasn't a trick of the light, or being tired, I saw this, and I'm sure the other guys would say they did too if they still could.\n\nTheir eyes Mary, this figure started to emerge from the fog, and the eyes, were glowing, 2 yellow spots piercing the gloom. As they got closer, it looked like one of the conscripted Krauts from a few nights back, same uniform. I figured they has a few more platoons to have use waste ammo on. But this time, there was no screaming, no running.They just shambledsilently through the fog. Theydidn't respond to ID's and soone of the guysput a round through its chest.\n\nNothing, it didn't react, didn't go down, didn't make a sound, and kept walking. A few more shots rang out until the ping of his clip ejecting echoed through the night, I watched them, every one hit, centre mass. It kept walking, a few seconds later a round went through its skull and it dropped, the eyes faded away as it fell.\n\nNo one knew what to think, but I could hear them jostling the poor guy saying he must have missed. One of the other guys boasting he knew how to drop Krauts. He didn't miss Mary, I swear on my mom's grave, I watched them hit its chest,and it didn't drop, just carried on asif being hit with rocks.\n\nThe jostling didn'tlast long, a few shout's said more movement. Ashout came for aflareto go up togive us a better look,I almost wish they hadn't. I saw them before the others, dozens of them, their eyes shining through the fog.We opened fireand these things couldn't have cared less. They marched through the fire, their bodies being tornupby multiplehitsand they kept coming.\n\nThe odd lucky round hit a head and a body dropped, butno oneseemed to notice. Panic was setting in now, the first one hit our line, dropped over the barricade. I heard the screams over gunfire, soul wrenching shrieks from the guys below.\n\nI know I should have done more, but it didn't seem real Mary. I looked though my scope and tried for headshots where I could,I must have dropped a few. But It wasn't enough, they kept coming.\n\nThat's whenI saw him Mary, the young soldier from the first attack, I'm sure it was him, I could see the wound on his leg, and the hole in his chest and his face, despite the eyes, he looked just as scared. I put him to rest, at least I did that.\n\nWe had to scramble to pull back from REDACTED, I'm not sure how many of us made it, but we lost more than a few good men last night. We managed to get out, and pull back to REDACTED. But they were coming we could hear them now, dozens of them just groaning in the night.\n\nNow Mary, this isn't going to be easy, but I think this may be the last letter I can send for a while, the10th have been ordered to stay and hold the ground at REDACTED, give the rest of the rear units time to pull back, set up a new line. Ive managed to scribble this down while they load up the trucks and I've given this letter to a Chaplin from the 57th and he's sworn to me he'll get it to you and I pray to god that he has.\n\nKnow that I love you, and I pray for the day I can come back home to you. I know the lord will give me strength to carry out his work and that I'm in your thoughts and prayers as you are in mine.\n\nAll my Love\n\nYour Edward.\n\n*Letter seized by Office of Censorship- Passed to OSS for further investigation*\n\n** Contents verified by multiple sources- evidence of German Rift Tech.**\n\n***The 10th Infantry Company, 3rd Battalion was wiped outby enemy action on the night of 3rd August 1944-Official reports will indicate fierce bombardment followed by an assault by enemy infantry of a known and poorly defended position- sub-par officer leadership and troop discipline will be blamed as primary factor.

Forgive me for the burden I'm about to place upon you, but I must share what I've witnessed. I fear for my sanity if I don't commit these events to paper. Please, believe what I'm about to tell you.\n\nIt began three days ago at the REDACTED research facility. As you know, I've been stationed here for months, working on classified projects I can't discuss. We were pushing the boundaries of science, Sarah, in ways I never thought possible.\n\nThat fateful night, I was alone in the lab, running final checks on our latest experiment. The facility was quiet, save for the hum of machinery and the occasional footsteps of security patrols. I was focused on my work when the alarms suddenly blared to life.\n\nRed lights flashed, and the emergency protocols initiated. I rushed to the observation window, expecting to see a fire or some other mundane disaster. What I saw instead chilled me to my very core.\n\nThe containment chamber, where we kept our most volatile subjects, was breached. Through the reinforced glass, I watched in horror as... something emerged. It was vaguely humanoid, Sarah, but wrong in ways I struggle to describe. Its limbs were too long, its movements jerky and unnatural. And its face – dear God, its face was a nightmare of misshapen features and gaping orifices.\n\nI froze, unable to comprehend what I was seeing. Then it turned and looked directly at me with eyes that glowed an unholy yellow. In that moment, I knew true terror.\n\nThe security team arrived, weapons drawn. They opened fire without hesitation, filling the chamber with a hail of bullets. But the creature, this abomination, barely flinched. It advanced on them, tearing through their ranks with inhuman strength and savagery.\n\nI should have run then, should have fled the facility and never looked back. But morbid fascination kept me rooted to the spot. I watched as more of these things emerged from the chamber, each more horrifying than the last. They spread through the complex like a plague, their unholy shrieks echoing through the halls.\n\nEventually, self-preservation kicked in. I barricaded myself in the lab, praying the reinforced door would hold. For hours, I listened to the sounds of carnage outside. The gunfire, the screams, the inhuman howls – they'll haunt me for the rest of my days, however long that may be.\n\nWhen silence finally fell, I dared to hope it was over. But then I heard them, Sarah. Shuffling footsteps and low, guttural moans just outside the lab. They knew I was here. They were waiting.\n\nI've been trapped here for two days now. The emergency power is failing, and my food and water are nearly gone. I can still hear them out there, pacing restlessly. Sometimes, I catch glimpses of glowing eyes peering through the small window in the door.\n\nI don't know how much longer I can hold out. If rescue doesn't come soon, I'll have to make a desperate attempt to escape. But I fear what I might become if those things catch me.\n\nSarah, my love, if you receive this letter, you must alert the authorities. What happened here cannot be covered up or ignored. These abominations must be stopped at all costs.\n\nKnow that I love you with all my heart. You've been my light in this darkness, and thoughts of you have kept me sane these past days. I pray we'll be reunited, but if not, please remember me as I was.\n\nForever yours,\nJames\n\n*Letter intercepted by FBI - Immediate action required*\n\n**Contents corroborated by multiple sources - Evidence of unauthorized experimentation**\n\n***REDACTED research facility quarantined on 19th October 1962 - Official reports cite containment breach of hazardous materials - All personnel presumed lost***\n\n****Classified DELTA-BLACK/EYES ONLY - Original letter preserved, all copies destroyed - Project CHIMERA terminated with extreme prejudice****", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference story quite well.

{"id": "text_completion_043", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"1130\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Ah, look at that. It's a cardboard box, sitting on a hill. A lonely hill, at first glance. The cardboard box was a cardboard color, that off-brown. It was a common color, more common than bark here. But there was only one for a good distance around, so I guess we'll have to settle with this one. Come on. Let's get a closer look!\n\n\nThis box was upside down, so when the smarter critters of this world looked down from their cardboard planes they'd see a cross in its little flaps. Not that the box couldn't be opened on both ends, it's just that the skywards side was taped up and impenetrable.\n\nThe box was meant to be carried this direction, though. Whoever had opened it had opened it up from the wrong side. You could tell because this box had two little oval-shaped dotted lines, which could be popped on out to lift the thing. One was still in. The other had disappeared, having turned into the only part of the box for folk like us. Observers, who couldn't do much with cardboard but peak in. The inside of the box was mostly hidden in shadow, like a nest of black fur. Maybe this box was empty! But it most likely wasn't, the box-critter is probably sleeping. Here, let's try to wake it up. A bit of wind would probably do the trick.\n\nwoooooooooooshhhhhhhhhhh…\n\nGood job, good job, that's— that's a good wind. A constant breeze, which causes the grass about the hill to flow up and down in hollow V-shapes alongside those who traverse in boats on the opposite side of the dirt. The grass was once again alive, and trading gossip as much as grass ever does. Petty little plants.\n\nOur box was not ready for the wind. It was pushed up into the air just a few inches, before eight-odd triangles covered in static-filled hairs erupted out of the box and clicked into place about the dirt and stone. That little handle-hole, the one which had been popped out by someone some time back, gained two round golden eyes, like lost fireflies who'd soared a bit too high in that night sky. The box-critter spun in a circle, looking about for whoever had spawned this wind. But after not seeing much of anything, it settled on making an annoyed Tik tik! sound, and started off on its way down the hill. Come on, let's follow it. Maybe it'll lead us to something interesting.\n\nYou know, I'm surprised this one is alone. They normally travel in groups! Hm? Oh, yeah, I'm sure the groups have an actual name, I just don't know what it is. The box-critter doesn't seem to know quite where it is going. It makes its way down one hill just to go up another. It seems to have a solid goal though, spinning about at the top of every hill before choosing which one it'll go to next. It always seems to choose the tallest one, maybe searching for a good view, or something more useful. Do you think it's lost? Is that why it isn't with a group? How sad.\n\nA sound was added to the music of the landscape. Up until now, the noise was basically just background, not really making for an important Observation. It was just acting out its part in the world because it had to, because it was always there, and because it was nice. The breeze made for a good chorus and the grass added some interesting verses. But it was all disrupted by the sad growling of the box-critters hidden stomach. Tik tik. The box-critter kept wandering. It kept looking for food. The firefly lights in its box's handle-peephole grew dim. I… don't like Observing this. But we've already chosen it as our Narrated, and I don't see any other cardboard critters around to switch it with…\n\nHere's the thing about grass. As I've mentioned, they're petty creatures, but they're also important ones. Grass divides one place from another. Crossing grass has to happen no matter who you are or where you're going. And grass can be very helpful, when they're kind enough to use their role as Bridge to Everywhere to accomplish great things…\n\nAnd, well, I'd really like to think grass is forgiving, whether or not that's the case is up to you.\n\nThe grass didn't react. Then one, tiny strand, one that had just sprouted and couldn't even be really seen by anyone but ants and the smallest of Observers, decided it wanted to be what I'd just Narrated. It decided it wanted to try, even if it didn't really like Observers as a concept. After all, what was the point of being an Observer? Wasn't the world built to be interacted with? Wasn't it a blade of grass so that it could talk with and traverse the dirt? The child blade sunk into the dirt, inverting its small piece of the hill quilt. And the rest of the grass decided to join it, in a rare domino effect. The box-critter fell into a sinkhole, and popped up on the other side of the grass, where a muddy-green sea expanded in all directions. The box-critter was sitting in its cardboard shell as though it were a boat, which meant it was very much exposed for the time being. Box-critters are simple beings. Just black fur, legs, and eyes. It clutched the frontmost wall of its boat-box and watched the waves pass by. It was either confused by how it had gotten here or happy with the view, it's up to you.\n\nHere, let's blow the water, we can push the box-critter along. Create a V-shape in the water. Maybe someone traversing the hills will see it in the grass, and imagine up a story for the specific adventure that we're causing. Who knows! The water passes by. The colors change, from green-brown to a perfect clear, with the roots of the grass rise upwards like seaweed in the water. Actually, some of the grass looks sick. Mushrooms, some fungus or another, was growing along their roots, trying to kill them off where they can't defend themselves. The fungus is of an edible breed, let's help out our box-critter while also aiding the grass that got us here.\n\nWe blew the fungus off the grass, so it floated atop the water, off-white islands just within reach of the box-critters' pyramidal legs. It made for a solid meal, though the consistency of soggy mushrooms got dull after a bit I'm sure. The box-critter was creative though, bending the mushrooms in different shapes over the side of its cardboard boat and leaving them out to dry for a bit. Tik tik, it said.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

It's 11:30, glowing softly on a digital clock. A lonely clock, at first glance. The numbers were a pale green, that eerie shade. It was a common color for clocks, more common than red here. But there was only one in this darkened room, so I guess we'll have to settle with this one. Come on. Let's get a closer look!\n\nThis clock was perched on a nightstand, so when the nocturnal creatures of this world looked up from their shadowy realms they'd see a beacon in the night. Not that the clock couldn't be viewed from other angles, it's just that the front was the only side emitting that ghostly glow.\n\nThe clock was meant to be read this direction, though. Whoever had placed it had oriented it perfectly. You could tell because this clock had two little buttons on top, which could be pressed to set the time or alarm. One was slightly depressed. The other stood proud, having turned into the only part of the clock for folk like us. Observers, who couldn't do much with time but watch it pass. The room beyond the clock was mostly hidden in darkness, like a cavern of black velvet. Maybe this room was empty! But it most likely wasn't, the room-dweller is probably sleeping. Here, let's try to wake them up. A bit of sound would probably do the trick.\n\nbeep beep beep beep...\n\nGood job, good job, that's— that's a good alarm. A constant chime, which causes the air about the room to vibrate in hollow waves alongside those who traverse in dreams on the opposite side of consciousness. The silence was once again broken, and trading whispers as much as silence ever does. Sneaky little sound.\n\nOur room-dweller was not ready for the alarm. They stirred just a few inches, before two-odd arms covered in static-filled hairs erupted out of the blankets and fumbled about the nightstand. That little alarm button, the one which had been slightly depressed by someone some time back, gained two round bleary eyes, like lost moons who'd fallen a bit too low in that night sky. The room-dweller spun in a circle, looking about for whoever had spawned this noise. But after not seeing much of anything, they settled on making an annoyed Ugh sound, and started off on their way out of bed. Come on, let's follow them. Maybe they'll lead us to something interesting.\n\nYou know, I'm surprised this one is alone. They normally sleep in pairs! Hm? Oh, yeah, I'm sure the pairs have an actual name, I just don't know what it is. The room-dweller doesn't seem to know quite where they are going. They make their way out of one room just to go into another. They seem to have a solid goal though, stumbling about at the threshold of every doorway before choosing which one they'll go to next. They always seem to choose the brightest one, maybe searching for a good light, or something more useful. Do you think they're lost? Is that why they aren't with a partner? How sad.\n\nA sound was added to the music of the night. Up until now, the noise was basically just background, not really making for an important Observation. It was just acting out its part in the world because it had to, because it was always there, and because it was nice. The alarm made for a good chorus and the shuffling feet added some interesting verses. But it was all disrupted by the sad growling of the room-dweller's hidden stomach. Ugh.

And kitchens can be very helpful, when they're stocked enough to use their role as Bridge to Nourishment to accomplish great things…\n\nAnd, well, I'd really like to think kitchens are forgiving, whether or not that's the case is up to you.\n\nThe kitchen didn't react. Then one, tiny light, one that had just flickered on the microwave and couldn't even be really seen by anyone but mice and the smallest of Observers, decided it wanted to be what I'd just Narrated. It decided it wanted to try, even if it didn't really like Observers as a concept. After all, what was the point of being an Observer? Wasn't the world built to be interacted with? Wasn't it a kitchen light so that it could illuminate and guide the hungry? The child light blinked into life, inverting its small piece of the kitchen darkness. And the rest of the appliances decided to join it, in a rare domino effect. The room-dweller stumbled into the suddenly bright kitchen, and blinked rapidly on the other side of the threshold, where a gleaming white expanse expanded in all directions. The room-dweller was standing in their pajamas as though they were a ship's captain, which meant they were very much exposed for the time being. Room-dwellers are simple beings. Just sleepy hair, limbs, and eyes. They clutched the frontmost cabinet and watched the light dance by. They were either confused by how they had gotten here or happy with the view, it's up to you.\n\nHere, let's open the fridge, we can guide the room-dweller along. Create a cool breeze in the air. Maybe someone traversing the halls will see it and imagine up a story for the specific adventure that we're causing. Who knows! The cool air passes by. The colors change, from stark white to a perfect rainbow, with the contents of the fridge rise upwards like a treasure trove in the night. Actually, some of the food looks old. Mold, some decay or another, was growing along their edges, trying to spoil them where they can't defend themselves. The fresh food is of an edible breed, let's help out our room-dweller while also aiding the kitchen that got us here.\n\nWe blew the fresh food to the front, so it stood out atop the shelves, colorful islands just within reach of the room-dweller's sleep-clumsy hands. It made for a solid meal, though the consistency of cold leftovers got dull after a bit I'm sure.

{"id": "text_completion_044", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"romance\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Once upon a time, there was a young man, headstrong and clear about his desires in life. Despite his youth, he possessed a unique sense of purpose. He had recently moved into a small neighborhood nestled in the forest just outside of town, eager to start a new chapter of his life. One day, while out on a walk, he encountered two beautiful young girls who had recently moved into the neighborhood, each living on opposite sides of the neighborhood. Despite their contrasting natures, they got along remarkably well. The first girl was incredibly smart. She wore glasses and had a stunning head of golden curls. She loved to weave stories for her friends, tales of fantastic beasts, heroic adventures, and the mysteries of space and stars. Her gentle nature reflected her love for all living things. She dreamed of going to college and becoming someone who made a difference. Her dreams were as brilliant as her spirit and very achievable. Her name was Yellow.\n\nThe second girl was a blend of fierceness and peace. She exuded a calm and serene demeanor but could become piercingly unpredictable when needed. Never mean, she had a somber side when necessary and a fierce determination when required. Unlike Yellow, she was not as ambitious. She cherished life as it was, content and complacent, wanting to see where it would naturally lead her. Her name was Blue. Both just as beautiful.\n\nThat day, they decided to be friends. They spent a lot of time together—sometimes all three of them, and other times one on one. As the years went by, they became best friends, almost inseparable. Despite their friendship, the young man found himself falling in love with both of them, but he never confessed his feelings.\n\nThey explored the woods together, venturing as far as they could and sharing countless stories. Always led by Yellow's ambition and curious nature. The more time they spent together, the deeper the young man's love grew. Then, without warning, Yellow left. She disappeared without telling anyone, breaking the young man's heart. He had loved her deeply but never told her. He searched everywhere and asked everyone, but no one knew where she had gone, or even seemed to remember her.\n\nDevastated, he and Blue mourned the loss of their friend and tried to move on. With Yellow gone, the young man's time and attention were now focused solely on Blue.\n\nThe two of them grew up together, transitioning into adulthood. Blue remained as content and serene as ever. As more years passed, the young man's love for Blue deepened, though a part of his heart still belonged to Yellow. He never truly moved on from her departure, but Blue was always there to support him, sharing in his sorrow. After all, she had been friends with Yellow too.\n\nOne morning the young man heard a knock on the door. To his surprise when he opened the door, it was Yellow. He began to weep. After so many years his search was finally over. He finally found his long lost love. All his feelings came back to him like a rush of water. He embraced her tightly and they both fell to their knees. She started to cry as well. The only words to come out of her mouth was \"im sorry\". After they collected themselves they called Blue over and celebrated her return. They asked her many times what had happened. To this day they never got a real answer.\n\nNaturally, she was reintegrated back into their lives. They became a trio again. Once again they were spending time together like before, but this time as adults. They had cars and money and real places beyond the forest to explore. So the group once again was led by Yellow's ambition to adventure. They went off to new places, the three of them. Saw new things and met new people and ate new foods. The young man fell in love with her all over again. He was back to a heart divided. After all this time he still never told either of them how he felt.\n\nHowever, the fun couldn't last forever. As Yellow's ambition to achieve her dreams grew, she wanted to do more. Blue remained content and wanted to enjoy life as it was. The young man found himself at a crossroads, torn between his love for Yellow and his love for Blue. He knew this day would come, a day when a decision had to be made. So after a month of pondering he decided he wanted to follow his own path.\n\nHe decided to get as far away from them both as possible. Not out of resentment or disdain, but because it hurt him too much to pick. If he chose one, he would never really be happy. The thought of leaving either of them behind tore at his heart though, creating an unbearable pain that seemed to suffocate him. Each time he thought about it, it felt like a wound reopening, yet he knew it was the only way to find solace. His love for both of them was so profound that to favor one would betray the other, and in that betrayal, he would lose a part of himself. The ache of his divided heart was a constant reminder of what he was giving up.\n\nThe day came when Yellow announced she had enrolled in the college of her dreams. It was time for her to leave once more, just when it seemed they had only just gotten her back. That same day, the young man decided to speak up and tell them he was leaving too, in a different direction, far from home and even farther from them. At that moment, he broke down, unable to bear it any longer. After 15 years, he finally confessed his feelings, speaking with such passion, affection, and love that each word was like a symphony to their ears. When he finished, he sat down and just cried. The silence between them was deafening.\n\nThey both stared at him. Teary eyed and dazed. Not much was said after that. The night came soon and they all just wanted to go home. After a few exchanged words, they said their goodnights and farewells, each going their separate ways. A trio a lifetime in the making, broken in an hour. The young man left a few days later, his heart shattering completely when neither Blue nor Yellow came to see him off or say goodbye. For months, they didn't speak—not one letter, just complete silence. It burned him deeply. Every second was filled with tears, every minute felt like an eternity, and every day was a struggle. All he could think about was them.\n\nHe tried so hard to forget about them. He did everything he could. But everything reminded him of them. Every tree, every creek, every story he heard. It all just reminded him of them. Years go by and he traveled the world. Never staying in one place. How could he? He knew there had to be a place farther from them. A place that's beyond even memories. He grew older and older. He never found the perfect place nor did he ever move on. His love was so strong it never wore away even after his body did. After so many years he couldnt travel anymore. So he decided to settle down where it all began.\n\nHe went home. The only place he ever really called home. When he got there all that was left was one house amidst a dense forest. Well maintained and lived in. He walked up to the door and on it hung a sign that read \"I kept it warm for you. -Blue\" He opened the door but no one was there. He looked around to find anyone but he was all alone. He found old pictures of the three of them hung on the wall with notes on each one. They all read different things like memories of those days or comments about the picture. He sat on his old couch and on the table was a note. He picked it up with trembling hands and he began to read\n\nDear Logan,\n\nYou finally made it home after so many years. I wish I could be there to see you. I wish I could have said goodbye all those years ago, and I'm sorry I didn't. I was scared that if I saw you, I would have gone with you. But my place was always here. Yellow left shortly after you did. She missed you, but only as a friend. That's all she ever wanted. She was in love with her dreams and ambitions, always seeing only what she wanted and going after it. She really made it seem like there was a choice, didn't she? Like your love was warranted. We both saw it. When you confessed, it wasn't a shock—we just didn't know what to say. We both knew how you felt. Why she led you on is beyond me. She knew you loved her but made it seem like you had a chance. Like you could choose. But even if you had chosen her, she would have left anyway. To her, you were a friend, and that's all it ever was.\n\nBut for me, I knew you loved me, and I wish you had said something sooner. I loved you too, but I never spoke up. It's partially my fault. I was too content with things as they were to start something new. We were meant to be, but fate had other plans, I guess. I waited for you, but you never came back. The only reason you left was because she made you feel like you had to choose. In our eyes, there was really only one option. I wish we had said something sooner.\n\nMaybe in another life, we could have made it work. Until then, know that you were always loved. See you when you get here. Love, Blue\n\nAs He read the note, tears welled up in his eyes, and he felt a profound sense of sorrow mixed with a strange relief. Blue's words echoed in the quiet house, filling the empty spaces with the love and regrets of a lifetime. He sat on the old couch, memories flooding back, each one more vivid than the last. As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow through the windows, Logan felt a sense of peace he hadn't felt in years. He knew that his journey had come full circle.\n\nHe stood up and walked outside, feeling the cool evening breeze on his face. He wandered through the familiar paths of the forest, each step bringing back a memory of his youth. He realized that Blue had been right—this place was his true home, the only place where he felt truly at peace.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Logan slowly began to rebuild his life in the place where it all started. He tended to the house and the garden, finding solace in the simple routines. He wrote letters to Blue, though he had no address to send them to, pouring out his thoughts and feelings, hoping that somehow, she would know.\n\nAs the seasons changed, Logan's health began to decline. He knew his time was coming to an end, but he felt ready. He had found his peace, and he was surrounded by the memories of those he loved. One crisp autumn evening, he sat on the porch, wrapped in a warm blanket, watching the sun set over the forest. The sky was painted with hues of orange and pink, a final gift from the sky as if it was welcoming him.\n\nAs the stars began to appear, Logan closed his eyes and let out a contented sigh. He felt the presence of Yellow and Blue, their love enveloping him like a comforting embrace. With a heart full of love and memories, Logan drifted into a peaceful sleep, never to awaken. The last thing he heard as his spirit left his body was the faint sound of Blue and Yellow's voice. \"Ready for the next adventure?\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Rose, who had always been fascinated by the idea of true love. She had recently moved to a quaint coastal town, seeking inspiration for her writing and a fresh start in life. One sunny afternoon, while strolling along the beach, she encountered two charming men who had also just settled in the area, living on opposite ends of the shoreline.\n\nThe first man, whom she came to know as Jasper, was a brilliant marine biologist. He wore thick-rimmed glasses and had tousled dark hair that seemed perpetually windswept. Jasper was passionate about ocean conservation and could spend hours regaling anyone who would listen with tales of mysterious deep-sea creatures and the wonders of coral reefs. His enthusiasm was infectious, and his eyes sparkled with excitement whenever he spoke about his work. He dreamed of making groundbreaking discoveries that would help protect the world's oceans.\n\nThe second man, called Finn, was a laid-back surfer with sun-bleached hair and a carefree smile. He exuded a calm and easygoing demeanor but could become fiercely protective when it came to the things he cared about. Unlike Jasper, Finn wasn't driven by ambition or grand plans. He was content to live each day as it came, finding joy in the simple pleasures of life and the perfect waves. His name suited him well, as he seemed most at home in the water.\n\nThat day, the three of them struck up a friendship. They began spending time together—sometimes all three, and other times in pairs. As the months passed, they became inseparable, sharing countless adventures along the coast. Rose found herself drawn to both men, their contrasting personalities complementing each other perfectly. She cherished their friendship but couldn't help the growing feelings she harbored for both of them.\n\nTheir days were filled with exploration and laughter. Jasper would lead them on expeditions to hidden tide pools, explaining the intricate ecosystems with boundless enthusiasm. Finn taught them to surf, his patience and encouragement helping Rose find her balance on the waves. The more time they spent together, the deeper Rose's feelings grew, but she never dared to express them.\n\nThen, without warning, Jasper left. He had been offered a position on a research vessel, an opportunity too good to pass up. Rose was heartbroken, having never told him how she felt. She searched the beach every day, hoping to catch a glimpse of him returning, but he was gone.\n\nDevastated, Rose and Finn mourned the loss of their friend and tried to move forward. With Jasper gone, Rose's time was now solely focused on Finn. They continued to surf together, finding solace in the rhythm of the waves.\n\nYears passed, and Rose and Finn grew closer. Her feelings for Finn deepened, though a part of her heart still yearned for Jasper. She never truly got over his departure, but Finn was always there, a constant source of comfort and joy.\n\nOne stormy evening, as Rose was walking along the beach, she spotted a familiar figure in the distance. Her heart raced as she recognized Jasper, returned after all these years. Overcome with emotion, she ran to him, embracing him tightly as the waves crashed around them. Tears mingled with the salty spray as Jasper whispered, \"I'm sorry I left.\"\n\nJasper's return brought a whirlwind of emotions. The trio was reunited, and they fell back into their old routines with surprising ease. Now adults, they had new means to explore the world beyond their coastal town. Jasper's passion for marine life took them on diving expeditions to vibrant coral reefs, while Finn's love for the waves led them to surf some of the most beautiful beaches in the world.\n\nRose found herself falling in love with Jasper all over again, her heart once more divided between the two men who meant everything to her. Despite the years that had passed, she still couldn't bring herself to confess her feelings to either of them.\n\nAs time went on, the differences between Jasper and Finn became more pronounced. Jasper's ambition grew stronger, his desire to make a difference in the world of marine conservation pushing him to take on more challenging projects. Finn, on the other hand, remained content with his simple life by the sea, finding fulfillment in the daily rhythms of coastal living.\n\nRose found herself at a crossroads, torn between her love for both men and the diverging paths they represented. After weeks of internal struggle, she decided that she needed to forge her own path, away from both of them. The thought of leaving either behind was almost unbearable, but she knew it was necessary for her own growth and happiness.\n\nThe day came when Jasper announced he had been offered a prestigious position at a marine research center in another country. It was an opportunity of a lifetime, but it meant leaving their coastal town once again. That same evening, Rose gathered her courage and told them both that she too would be leaving, pursuing her dream of becoming a travel writer.\n\nIn that moment, overwhelmed by the impending separation, Rose finally confessed her feelings. Her words poured out like a tidal wave, expressing years of love, confusion, and longing. When she finished, silence fell over them, broken only by the sound of the waves.\n\nJasper and Finn looked at her, their eyes filled with a mix of surprise, understanding, and sadness. Not much was said after that. They parted ways that night, each needing time to process the revelation.\n\nRose left a few days later, her heart heavy with the weight of unresolved emotions. Neither Jasper nor Finn came to see her off, and the silence that followed in the coming months was deafening. Every beach she visited reminded her of them, every wave carrying whispers of their laughter.\n\nYears went by, and Rose traveled the world, writing about the places she visited and the people she met. But no matter how far she went, she couldn't escape the memories of Jasper and Finn. Her love for them remained constant, a bittersweet companion on her journey.\n\nAs she grew older, Rose realized that her heart would always belong to that coastal town and the two men who had captured it. She decided to return home, hoping to find peace in the place where it all began.\n\nWhen she arrived, she found the town much changed, but the beach house she once called home still stood. A note was pinned to the door: \"Welcome back, Rose. The sea has missed you. - Finn\"\n\nInside, she found the house just as she remembered it, filled with mementos of their shared past. On the coffee table lay two letters, one from Jasper and one from Finn. With trembling hands, she read them both.\n\nJasper's letter spoke of his regret for leaving, of the discoveries he had made, and how thoughts of Rose had been with him through it all. Finn's letter was simpler, speaking of quiet days by the sea, of waves ridden in her memory, and of a love that had never faded.\n\nAs the sun set over the ocean, Rose sat on the porch, letters clutched to her chest. She realized that her journey had always been leading her back here, to the place where her heart truly belonged.\n\nIn the years that followed, Rose found peace in the rhythm of coastal life. She wrote stories of the sea, of love, and of the paths we choose. Sometimes, she thought she caught glimpses of Jasper and Finn in the faces of passing strangers or in the curl of a perfect wave.\n\nAnd on her last day, as she sat watching the sun sink into the sea, Rose felt a sense of completion. The love she had carried all these years had shaped her, guided her, and ultimately brought her home. As the stars began to appear, she closed her eyes with a smile, feeling the presence of Jasper and Finn beside her. In her final moments, she heard their voices on the wind, inviting her to join them for one last adventure beyond the horizon.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text does an excellent job of capturing the distinct writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference story.

And while you've known them for such a short time, you feel like you have loved them for a lifetime.\" - Courtney Peppernell*\n\nI was privileged to live a normal life. Work a normal job. Earn an average salary. Go home to an ordinary house. But for me it was too normal. I wanted to be something else. Someone I would look up to. Someone I could admire. But I was just too normal and I hated it.\n\nAfter a long and typical day at work, I would usually go to the bar with some friends from work. There's this somewhat secret bar that we often go to because not a lot of people would be there, and basically get the place all to ourselves. Today was a bit different. I went there alone because my friends all have relationships they had to juggle. I was a bit jealous but I didn't really mind. I was barely making enough for my own, how could I get into a relationship when I'm not stable enough. As I got into the bar, it was, as expected, empty except for a woman in the bar where I would usually sit. I approached the table and sat down beside her.\n\n\"Whiskey, on the rocks.\", I ordered my usual drink from the bartender. He nodded and proceeded to make the drink for me.\n\nI was curious as to what the woman looked like so I took a quick glance but at the same time I looked at her, I met her eyes. She was beautiful. She was pale but had a pinkish blush on her cheeks. Her eyes were big and housed beautiful brown iris. Her lips were full, painted with a pinkish tint. She was what I would call ‘my ideal type'. I looked away and got saved by my drink arriving in front of me.\n\n\"Thanks.\", I blurted out as I got so nervous sitting beside her.\n\n\"So what do you think?\", she asked. I got even more nervous and was honestly quite surprised to be asked a question.\n\n\"Me?\", I asked as I tried to confirm if she was really talking to me.\n\n\"Who else?\", She continued to look at me as she sipped her Margarita. \"So? Am I pretty or not?\"\n\n\"Wha- Why would you ask me that?\", I nervously tried to avoid her question but it didn't really work.\n\n\"Well, you were curious enough to see how I looked that you tried your best to glance. I just wanted to know if I passed your expectations.\", she continued.\n\nShe was very brazen and really didn't have a hint of shame as she continued to ask me the question. But I honestly found that quite intriguing.\n\nI shyly laughed and took a sip from my drink. \"Yeah.\", I said as I took a sip.\n\nShe chuckled. \"Well good\". She chugged her drink and got up. \"Let's go\", she said as she enthusiastically looked at me.\n\nI was taken aback as I didn't really know what she meant. \"What? I haven't even finished my drink yet.\", I tried talking my way out of it as I just wanted to finish my drink.\n\nShe took out her wallet and paid for my drink. \"Here, a treat for my friend.\", she handed the bill to the waiter and proceeded to grab my hand and dragged me out of the bar.\n\n\"Wait! Wait!\", I took one final sip from my delicious whiskey.\n\nI was bummed out that I got disturbed from my alone time. I wasn't really expecting to be walking alone with a woman just by simply glancing at her. As I said, I wasn't in the right situation to really get into a relationship so I just continued to close my doors.\n\n\"I know a nice *tteokbokki* place around here.\" She looked really pretty though. Earlier in the bar, she was looking down before we started talking, but now she looks like a completely different person. She looks even more pretty now that she's smiling.\n\n\"Wait, I don't even know you, yet I'm getting dragged into a date.\"\n\n\"A date?\", she laughed at my nonsense. \"Well if you think this is a date, then I should really tell you my name then.\" She hopped in front of me and stared into my eyes. She reached out a hand. \"Valorie\".\n\nEven her name sounds pretty. I instinctively grabbed her hand and shook it. \"Luke\".\n\nShe smiled and proceeded to walk in front of me. \"Come on, it's just around the corner.\" I don't know whats with her, but she's oddly persuasive and captivating. I thought to myself that I was thankful that I wasn't this gullible when I was a kid.\n\nAs we entered the *tteokbokki* shop, she was immediately greeted by the owner. \"V! You're back! The usual?\", the owner exclaimed. They seem to have a good relationship as the owner already knew what she wanted.\n\n\"Yes please! And make it double serving please.\", She sat down on the window side and gestured to me to sit down.\n\n\"I didn't know that there was a place like this here.\" For the longest time I lived in Seoul, it was the first time I've seen this snackbar. It looked old but I was sure it carried a lot of memories as well.\n\n\"I come here all the time. Their *tteokbokki* and *odeng* are the real deal.\" She looked happy and it was contagious.\n\n\"You look like a kid.\", I joked and chuckled.\n\nShe frowned at me but her face changed once again when the *tteokbokk*i arrived.\n\n\"Thank you!\", she smiled and merrily dug her chopsticks into the steaming dish. \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" she asked with a mouthful of tteok.\n\nI smiled and proceeded to eat with her. We continued talking and just like that, we both felt close to one another. We shared our stories. She had a completely different style from mine but I found that very attractive. She was the opposite of my normal and boring life and for the first time in my life, I was able to live a not so normal day. It was a feeling that I guess I would never forget.\n\nAs time passed, it became midnight.\n\n\"Well, I think I gotta go. Same time tomorrow, okay?\" She instructed me.\n\n\"What? We're meeting again tomorrow?\" I asked because I was honestly shocked that she still wanted to meet me.\n\n\"Yeah. Why? Are you sick of me already?\" Her face turned from happy to sad and it showed that she might have been going through something.\n\n\"No! I didn't mean that, it's just I didn't know that you'd still like to see me.\", I explained.\n\nHer face lit up. \"Well, if I didn't want to see you again, I would have just said my goodbye, wouldn't I?\" She said with a light grin. \"See you tomorrow!\", she turned around and we proceeded to separate.\n\nThe next day, after work, I was excited to leave. It was the first time in my life that I was looking forward to something after work. What I felt the other day was bliss and I wanted more of that. When work ended, I immediately went to the bar. But to my surprise she wasn't there. I checked the time, and it was exactly the time when I met her. I approached the bartender.\n\n\"The girl, from yesterday, has she–\", I was cut short by a light tap on my shoulder.\n\n\"Looking for me?\", she chuckled. \"Sorry I was late, something came up.\" she explained. She was covered in sweat and she was extra pale today.\n\n\"I-I wasn't looking for you, I was just–\". She placed her finger on my lips and shushed me.\n\n\"Shhh. Stop talking and just come with me.\", she grabbed me by the hand and rushed outside the bar. We took a long walk towards the bus station.\n\n\"Where are we going this time?\" I asked, but she was completely different from yesterday. She wasn't as cheerful and she was just still.\n\n\"Just follow me for a bit.\", a wry smile formed on her lips and it seemed a bit forced. I knew that something was up from that moment. I didn't want to pry but I was getting a little bit worried based on her expressions.\n\n\"Come on, the bus is here.\"\n\nWe boarded the bus and traveled 2 hours to get to Hanagae beach. It was beautiful and we arrived just in time for the sunset. It was quiet on the beach, there was no one there except for us. We walked by the beach side, and admired the sunset. She stood there basked in the orange glow of the setting sun, and she was beautiful.\n\n\"I'm sick.\" she blurted out.\n\n\"Do you have a cold? I could get you some meds–\", I offered. She looked at me and chuckled.\n\n\"Not that kind of sick.\", she looked back at the sun and everything was still. \"I am positive with HIV\"\n\nI was taken back. I didn't know what to say. She looked at me and tears started to flow from her eyes. She fell on the sand and I immediately caught her.\n\n\"I want to live.\" She cried. I couldn't help myself but cry with her. It was news I never expected to hear from someone like her. I comforted her to the best of my ability but I couldn't hide the fact that I was crying with her.\n\n\"Thank you for crying for me.\" she said with a sad smile as she wiped the tears off my cheek. \"Want to hear my story?\".\n\nI nodded and we proceeded to sit on the sand as twilight swallowed the sky. She told me the story of how she got the illness. She told me how her stepfather would sexually harass her, how she would get beaten up if she resisted. She told me how her mother didn't really care about her as she was blinded by her love for her stepfather. She refused to believe the fact that her daughter was getting abused by that sick and worthless stepfather. I was enraged. Words could not express how furious I was to the people who did this to her. I was shaking from anger that it hurt just thinking about it. How could people do this to her? How could something like this happen to someone? I thought these things only happen in movies or in dramas. I never expected it to happen to someone who I grew attached to. It hurts and I knew she was hurting even more.\n\nShe stood up and reached out her hand. Despite her circumstances she still held on and was strong. I admired her and my affections toward her grew even more. I wanted to set things right for her. I wanted her to taste happiness by justice from the people who did this to her. But I knew there was nothing left for me to do as both her stepfather and mother already passed because of the same illness. That was the reason why she was able to spend her remaining days in bliss.\n\n\"Is there anything I could do for you? Anything please.\", my emotions kept spilling out. Was there anything else I could do for her?\n\n\"Same time tomorrow, okay?\" she instructed with a smile. Her smile was beautiful and she shined so bright.\n\nI wiped the tears off my face and she embraced me. I couldn't say anything. My mind was in a haze. I never thought I could get attached to someone like this so quickly. It was a mere 2 days but she was able to make me feel so many emotions. I couldn't lose her.\n\n\"What? Are you sick of me already?\", she jokingly smiled at me. She was doing her best to stay strong, and she was doing well. \"Thank you for being here with me.\"\n\nThe next day, I couldn't keep myself still during work. I wanted to leave already and the last 5 minutes before work ends felt like 5 hours. When the clock struck 4 pm, I immediately left. I rushed to the bar, and there she was sipping her Margarita, waiting for me.\n\n\"What took you so long?\", she frowned. She looked so cute though and she wore such a girly outfit. Her face was still pale but she was stunning. This time, I was the one who grabbed her hand and dragged her out of the bar. I took her to a theme park and I wanted to make her experience things she couldn't before. We enjoyed riding the roller coaster. Going through the haunted mansion. Shoot and throw balls for stuffed toys. We ate popcorn and cotton candy. I then brought her to my favorite restaurant and stuffed ourselves with cheese and pasta. And at the end of the day we dropped by her favorite *tteokbokk*i place and shared even more stories.\n\n\"Thank you.\", she blurted out of the blue. She was looking at me dearly and it gave me butterflies.\n\n\"You know I got you.\", I boasted. My heart was pounding and she could tell.\n\n\"Come on, let's get going. I wanna walk by Han\", she stood up and we left the shop.\n\nWhile walking by the river, she hugged me from behind. My heart fluttered. It felt nice and I wish it wouldn't stop.\n\n\"I never knew I would like someone this fast.\", she continued to hug me then she walked ahead of me.\n\n\"Me too.\", I said softly, but I guess she heard because she looked at me and smiled. She gestured for me to walk with her and we continued to walk by the Han river.\n\nShe started getting tired so I suggested to walk her home.\n\n\"It's getting cold, let's get you home.\" I donned my coat jacket over her and we proceeded home.\n\n\"Luke.\", she called me. \"You made me feel loved today. I got to do things I never did before.\"\n\nI embraced her as her eyes became teary. \"I'll move the world for you, V.\" Then I kissed her. Her kiss was bliss and her embrace was warm. It felt like I was okay with the world ending as long as V was with me, but I knew that was impossible. I didn't want to remember the fact that she was living her final days with me. I wasn't prepared for her to leave me even if I knew.\n\n\"Same time tomorrow?\" I told her. I wanted to spend every day with her. She nodded.\n\nThe next day, work never seemed to end fast. Before work ended, I already texted her that I would be getting off in a few minutes. She replied saying that she was just in the bar and told me to hurry. Just as I was about to leave work, my manager called for me. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. I was already itching to leave but my manager decided to ask for my help for something he should already know as manager. It took around 30 minutes and I zoomed out of the office. I called her multiple times but she was not answering. I thought that she was sulking because I was late. I went by the bar but the bartender said she already left and she also left her phone there. I rushed to the *tteokbokki* shop, but still, she wasn't there. At this point, I started getting worried. I looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be found. And then finally, there she was sitting by Han river. Her pale pretty face staring blankly at the river. Her hair was blown by the wind exposing her neck. She was thinning. She was beautiful.\n\n\"V!\" I called.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled. \"You're here.\", she stood up but immediately collapsed on the ground.\n\nI rushed towards her and people started to flock. Her lips were dry and cold sweat covered her forehead. She was suffering. She was hurting.\n\n\"V! Stay with me, please!\" I begged as I kept her awake. \"Somebody help! Please help her!\" I cried out but people just kept staring. My hands were shaking as I grabbed my phone and dialed 119. \"V! Hey! Come on, stay awake for me please.\"\n\nShe smiled and held my face. \"You filled my final days with love.\" Tears filled her eyes, and so did mine. \"You loved me knowing what I have, and you made me feel alive.\"\n\n\"I love you, V\", I said as my vision of her got blurry because of my tears.\n\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't be with you longer. I'm sorry you had to love someone like me.\", she cried.\n\n\"What are you saying, V. You deserved to be loved. You deserve all the love in the world.\". I kept her close. \"Same time tomorrow, okay?\", I said. She chuckled and gave a wry smile. \"What? Are you sick of me already?\" I tearfully joke.\n\n\"I love you, Luke. Let's meet again in the next life, okay?\"\n\nI couldn't stop crying. My heart was getting torn into pieces. \"I'll look for you in the next life. I promise you. We will meet again in the next life.\"\n\nShe gave me her final smile full of warmth and finally closed her eyes.\n\nThere wasn't really a memorial for her. She had no other relatives that could do it for her. So, I held a small one in her stead. The bartender and the *tteokbokki* shop owner visited and paid their respects. We all knew who V was, how lovely and kind she was. Her memory will always be with us. The *tteokbokki* shop owner approached me and handed me a letter.\n\n\"V wanted me to give this to you. She gave it to me on the day she left.\", she handed the letter.\n\n\"Thank you.\", I said and my hands started to tremble as I held her letter. I was afraid to read it. So I kept it for a while.\n\nOnce the memorial ended, I remembered her telling me back in Hanagae beach, that she wanted her ashes to be scattered into the sea once she's gone, so I went there to fulfill her wishes. I spread her ashes on the water and the wind carried her further. I sat down, stared at the sunset and took out the letter she left me.\n\n\"Hello, Luke. The past couple of days have been the best days for me. You made me feel alive. You made me feel well. You cared for me with all your heart and I couldn't even repay you for what you have done for me. Once I'm gone, please mourn for me, but not too much, okay?. You deserve to be loved by someone who can stay longer by your side. Someone who can repay you for the love you have given. I wish I could have been that someone but I know I never will. Even though we met for the shortest time, It felt like I have loved you for a lifetime. Let us meet again in our next life. I love you with all my heart. -V\"\n\nMonths passed, and I continued to visit the bar, the *tteokbokki* shop, and Hanagae beach every day.\n\n\"I'm sorry V, it's been months but I still haven't gotten over you, and I guess I never will.\"\n\nBefore I met Valorie, I thought my life would remain the same. Boring, normal, alone. I thought that life was just that way and I accepted that for the longest time. But meeting her made a change in my redundant life. That change jump started many things in my life and made me see a whole new world. At the end of the day, it was all because of her.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Not me. I was too busy, too focused on my career, too afraid of getting hurt. But then, one ordinary Tuesday, everything changed.\n\nI was running late for work, as usual. The subway was packed, and I barely managed to squeeze into the last car. That's when I saw her. She was standing by the door, her nose buried in a well-worn copy of \"Pride and Prejudice.\" Her dark curls fell softly around her face, and she had the most captivating green eyes I'd ever seen.\n\nI couldn't look away. And then, as if she sensed my gaze, she looked up. Our eyes met, and for a moment, the world stood still. She smiled, and I felt my heart skip a beat. I wanted to say something, anything, but the words caught in my throat.\n\nThe train lurched to a stop, and she was gone. I watched her disappear into the crowd, kicking myself for not having the courage to speak to her. I thought that was it, just another missed connection in the big city.\n\nBut fate had other plans.\n\nLater that day, I was grabbing coffee at my usual spot when I heard a familiar voice behind me. \"One vanilla latte, please.\" I turned around, and there she was. The girl from the train.\n\nThis time, I didn't hesitate. \"Hi,\" I said, my voice surprisingly steady. \"I saw you on the train this morning. I'm Alex.\"\n\nShe smiled, and I swear the whole room lit up. \"I'm Sophie. I noticed you too.\"\n\nWe started talking, and before I knew it, an hour had passed. We shared stories about our lives, our dreams, our fears. It felt like I'd known her forever. When we finally parted ways, we exchanged numbers and made plans to meet again.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Sophie and I saw each other almost every day. We explored the city together, finding hidden gems in neighborhoods I thought I knew by heart. We stayed up late talking on the phone, sharing our deepest secrets and silliest jokes. I found myself falling for her, hard and fast.\n\nOne night, as we walked along the river, hand in hand, Sophie turned to me. \"You know,\" she said, her eyes sparkling in the moonlight, \"I never believed in love at first sight. But when I saw you on that train, something just clicked. It was like my heart recognized you, even though we'd never met.\"\n\nI pulled her close, overwhelmed by the intensity of my feelings. \"I know exactly what you mean,\" I whispered. \"I feel like I've been waiting for you my whole life.\"\n\nAs we kissed under the stars, I realized that sometimes, love finds you when you least expect it. In the span of a few short weeks, Sophie had become the most important person in my life. And while we'd known each other for such a short time, it felt like we'd loved each other for a lifetime.\n\nOur relationship wasn't always easy. We had our ups and downs, like any couple. But through it all, we held onto that initial spark, that feeling of recognition we'd felt on that crowded subway car.\n\nYears later, as we stood together on our wedding day, I looked into Sophie's eyes and saw the same girl who had captured my heart with a single glance. And I knew, with absolute certainty, that I would love her for the rest of my days.\n\nLove can be unexpected, unpredictable, and sometimes even inconvenient. But when it's real, when it's true, it has the power to change your entire world. Sophie walked into my life as a stranger on a train, and in the blink of an eye, she became my everything.

{"id": "text_completion_046", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Realistic Fiction\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: This is the story of the most fabulous man I have ever met. I'm telling it because Mr. Leon Miller would be too humble to ever speak highly of himself. Every once in a while you meet that one person who is the embodiment of true selflessness. No skeletons in the closet like the rest of us. Leon went above and beyond to always help others. Whether it was walking an old lady across the street even if he was running late to work, or fixing some young new driver's flat tire. Leon did it all. He was a yes man. However his yes's were true yes's. Never did give a pity yes. Leon loved to help.\n\nHe was the neighbor you went to when you needed to borrow some sugar. I loved working at the bank with him. He always made the place feel like you were in one big capsule of adderall. The warm rays that this man generated were so euphoric and welcoming. You forgot all of your troubles when Leon walked through the doors. What a beautiful man. I don't work at the bank anymore. It was too hard for me to be around all of the money always fighting the urge to pocket just a little. Now I am a taxi driver. You would think it is a grueling job but I truly don't mind. It doesn't compare to working with Leon though. It felt like I was working with Jesus Christ himself. Except way less annoying and righteous.\n\nLeon has a beautiful family. Why wouldn't he? Good people deserve good things. His wife Heather was a beautiful soul. Most people say they have a happy marriage, but we all know that's a farce. It seems like we all love to hate each other these days. Leon and Heather really did have a happy marriage. Like a movie. The kind to make a softy cry. Those two high school sweet hearts who went the distance and didn't regret it. Talk about rarity. Speaking of rarity, he had a set of beautiful twin daughters who were both heart surgeons in the same hospital. How confusing that must get. A family of life savers.\n\nLeon saved my life. I'll never forget the day I woke up. The luminescent lights were so bright. A constant ringing followed by a series of beeps fluctuated in my ears. The noise became my pulse. As I looked down my feet were strapped to my bed. Next to my bed was a man in a brown corduroy suit jacket with matching pants and a brussel sprout green tie. His fading gray hair looking almost like that of an arctic fox.\n\n\"Hello James.\" The man said to me. \"Glad to see you are awake!\"\n\nFrom that day forward my life was changed. Rehab never helped me. Eleven times and not one successful result. What I needed was Leon to find me face down in the gutter like that poet Edgar Allan Poe. Poor Guy. Was a literary genius and nobody ever knew it. Not I however. I am no literary genius. Just an ex junkie that an old kind soul rushed to the hospital. My Jesus. Leon Christ.\n\nWhen they discharged me I had no place to stay. Leon took me right in. Heather gave him no dirty look. I would listen through the walls and she would only say, \"James is a bright young man that we can fix right up, can't we baby?\" \"Yes my love.\" Leon would reassure her. That's just the type of people they were. True selflessness. Leon got me cleaned up and off the streets and I never went back. I don't even smoke reefer now. I'm not one of those kombucha born again yoga hippies. Just a normal guy with a rough past. Leon did fix me up. After I was all clean and ready he got me an interview at the bank. Of course I got the job. Anyone Leon speaks highly of always gets good things. I don't know if I deserved it but my savior always assured me I did.\n\nI worked at the bank with him for three years and cherished every moment. We were all horribly saddened when he announced his retirement and gave his final day. I know I would miss working with him even though I had an apartment a few streets down. The day before his last we threw him a big surprise party because we knew he would turn it down. He said he didn't deserve such praise but we all knew he did. Such selflessness.\n\nI woke up on the day of his final eight hours at the bank and couldn't help but notice one salty tear glide down my cheek as I took away my five o'clock shadow in the mirror. Leon had changed my life. I owe him everything and it hurt to know he was leaving. I got in my Prius, listening to Primus and prepared for the saddest drive to work I would take. The only sad drive to the bank I've ever had. When I arrived Leon had already opened up shop and was sitting at his teller station. \"James my son, I got you a gift.\" It was a picture of us in the hospital together. That's when the levee broke. One salty tear turned into a river. On his last day he got me a gift. The picture still sits on my night stand. Girls always tell me my dad looks like such a kind man. I always tell them he is the best.\n\nWe all tried to keep our spirits high that day while the minutes turned to hours. With ten minutes left in Leon's final day, a man walked through the door. I'll never forget his ugly wing tipped shoes and noticeable track marks. His ski mask looked like it was worn to the bone. Like he has made this sort of transaction before.\n\n\"Everyone get on the floor now!\" \"Let's make this quick and easy and nobody gets hurt.\" He walked up to Leon's desk. \"Okay old man, you know the drill. Put the money in the bag.\" Leon complied.\n\nThe man must've known it was closing time because he didn't ask for money in the safe. Leon dished out a couple grand and the man seemed satisfied. The wing tipped fellow was oddly calm. When the transaction was finished the man calmly turned to leave. \"Have a great day sir. I pray you find god.\" Leon said. The last words he ever spoke. The man stopped and turned. \"Tell him to find me first.\" He raised his gun and pulled the trigger and in the blink of an eye my savior was crucified.\n\nThat was four years ago and the man was never caught. Such a pity. A day doesn't go by that I don't reminisce about my best friend Leon. Good people deserve good things but don't always get them.\n\n\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a story on the topic \"Realistic Fiction\" in the style of the reference story:\n\nThis is the tale of the most extraordinary teacher I've ever encountered. I'm sharing it because Ms. Sarah Thompson would never boast about herself. Once in a blue moon, you meet someone who embodies pure dedication. No hidden agendas like the rest of us. Sarah went the extra mile to inspire her students. Whether it was staying late to help a struggling child or organizing weekend field trips to museums. Sarah did it all. She was a go-getter. But her enthusiasm was genuine. Never did she fake interest. Sarah loved to teach.\n\nShe was the educator parents sought when their kids needed extra help. I loved working at the high school with her. She always made the place feel like a hub of creativity and learning. The passion this woman exuded was so infectious and motivating. You forgot all about the bureaucracy when Sarah walked into the staff room. What a remarkable woman. I don't work at the school anymore. It was too challenging for me to maintain discipline in the classroom. Now I'm a librarian. You might think it's a dull job, but I actually enjoy it. It doesn't compare to working with Sarah though. It felt like I was collaborating with Michelle Obama herself. Except way less intimidating and political.\n\nSarah has a wonderful family. Why wouldn't she? Dedicated people deserve happiness. Her husband Mark was a compassionate soul. Most people claim they have a supportive spouse, but we all know that's often an exaggeration. It seems like we all love to complain about our partners these days. Sarah and Mark truly had a supportive marriage. Like something out of a novel. The kind to make cynics believe in love again. Those two college sweethearts who weathered life's storms together and came out stronger. Talk about inspiration. Speaking of inspiration, she had a brilliant son who became a renowned environmental scientist. A family of world-changers.\n\nSarah changed my life. I'll never forget the day I walked into her classroom. The colorful posters and student artwork adorning the walls were so vibrant. A constant hum of excited chatter followed by bursts of laughter filled my ears. The energy became my lifeline. As I looked around, I saw engaged students leaning forward in their seats. At the front of the room was a woman in a floral dress with a matching cardigan and a sunflower yellow scarf. Her salt-and-pepper hair framing a face full of enthusiasm.\n\n\"Welcome, Alex,\" the woman said to me. \"I'm so glad you've joined our class!\"\n\nFrom that day forward, my career was transformed. Traditional teaching methods never worked for me. Seven years and not one successful connection with students. What I needed was Sarah to show me how to ignite a passion for learning like that poet Maya Angelou. Brilliant woman. Was a literary genius and touched countless lives. Not I, however. I am no literary genius. Just an ex-burnout that a kind mentor took under her wing. My guiding light. Sarah Angelou.\n\nWhen I struggled with classroom management, I had nowhere to turn. Sarah took me right in. The principal gave her no skeptical look. I would overhear their conversations, and she would only say, \"Alex is a promising young teacher that we can nurture, can't we?\" \"Absolutely,\" the principal would agree. That's just the type of people they were. True mentors. Sarah got me confident and engaged, and I never looked back. I don't even dread Mondays now. I'm not one of those overly peppy teachers who wear school mascot costumes. Just a normal guy who found his calling. Sarah did nurture me. After I found my footing, she encouraged me to apply for the department head position. Of course, I got the job. Anyone Sarah speaks highly of always achieves great things. I don't know if I deserved it, but my mentor always assured me I did.\n\nI worked at the school with her for eight years and cherished every moment. We were all deeply saddened when she announced her retirement and gave her final semester. I knew I would miss working with her even though we lived in the same neighborhood. The week before her last day, we threw her a big surprise party because we knew she would decline a formal event. She said she didn't deserve such fanfare, but we all knew she did. Such humility.\n\nI woke up on the day of her final class and couldn't help but notice one salty tear glide down my cheek as I knotted my tie in the mirror. Sarah had transformed my career. I owe her everything, and it hurt to know she was leaving. I got in my Subaru, listening to NPR, and prepared for the most bittersweet drive to work I would take. The only melancholy drive to the school I've ever had. When I arrived, Sarah had already set up her classroom and was chatting with early students. \"Alex, my dear, I have something for you.\" It was a scrapbook of our years working together. That's when the dam broke. One salty tear turned into a torrent. On her last day, she gave me a gift. The scrapbook still sits on my desk. Colleagues always tell me my mentor looks like such an inspiring woman. I always tell them she is the best.\n\nWe all tried to keep our spirits high that day while the clock ticked away. With fifteen minutes left in Sarah's final class, a young girl raised her hand. I'll never forget her trembling voice and tear-stained cheeks. Her words hung heavy in the air.\n\n\"Ms. Thompson, I don't want you to go,\" she said. \"You're the only teacher who ever believed in me.\"\n\nSarah walked over to the girl's desk. \"Sweetie, I may be leaving this classroom, but I'll never stop believing in you. Promise me you'll keep working hard.\" The girl nodded.\n\nSarah must have sensed the emotional weight in the room because she didn't dwell on goodbyes. She launched into one last passionate lecture about the power of education. Sarah delivered her words with the same enthusiasm as her first day. When the bell rang, signaling the end of class, the students erupted in applause. \"Thank you all for being the reason I loved coming to work every day,\" Sarah said. The last words she ever spoke in that classroom. As the students filed out, many stopping for hugs and well-wishes, I noticed Sarah's eyes glistening. \"I pray they remember this moment,\" she whispered. I put my hand on her shoulder. \"They will,\" I assured her. \"You've touched more lives than you'll ever know.\"\n\nThat was three years ago, and Sarah's impact is still felt in the school halls. Not a day goes by that I don't think about my mentor and friend.

{"id": "text_completion_047", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"science fiction\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Steve opened the front door of his house and took in a deep breath. It was a nice cool, autumn day. The leaves were beginning to change color and in the sky above it was starting to cloud up. ‘Today will be a new day,' thought Steve as he took a step onto his front yard. ‘He would simply go out for a short 30 minute walk without any distractions, proving to his wife that he was not addicted to that new betting game.' Suddenly, as Steve took a step onto the sidewalk, his smart watch made a DING and an overly-excited voice began speaking. \"Good morning Steve! Hope you had a nice sleep! Would you like to place a bet on whether it will rain today?\" This was Cal, Steve's AI betting assistant.\n\n\"Morning Cal. Look, I'm trying to stay off of the Game for today. The wife isn't happy with my recent losses so I just want to go out on a peaceful walk without distraction.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to at least hear the odds? Based on the weather forecast, there is a 0.01% chance of it raining today, so the odds that it will rain are currently at +1200!\"\n\nSteve looked up once more at the sky and saw that the clouds were beginning to grow darker and darker. ‘Surely, it's going to rain,' he thought. \"Alright, one bet and that's it. I'll bet $10 that it will rain today.\"\n\n\"$10 on it raining today. Received and approved!\"\n\nSteve chuckled to himself at letting Cal goad him into making another bet. ‘One harmless bet,' he thought to himself. ‘Even if it missed, it would only be a $10 loss. The wife would hardly notice it.' Several minutes later, just as Steve turned the corner onto a cul-de-sac, he felt a drop of rain land on his shoulder. DING.\n\n\"Congratulations Steve!\" exclaimed Cal. \"It has started raining, which means you have hit your bet! $120 has been added to your account!\" Steve immediately felt a jolt of excitement rush through his entire body. It was the first time he had hit a bet with such high odds and he could now end the day having made over $100!\n\nWith more pep in his step, Steve began briskly walking around the cul-de-sac until he came across a couple arguing on their driveway. It was Mr. and Mrs. Jones, who were known to get in disputes over the former's bad drinking habits. Steve usually ignored them and was about to walk past when… DING.\n\n\"Congrats again on the big win Steve! Would you like to keep things going and bet on the likelihood that Mr. Jones drives away in his car? The odds are currently at +250!\"\n\nSteve looked up and saw that Mr. Jones had his car keys in his left hand as he raised his arms up at his wife. Feeling high off of his last win, Steve figured it wouldn't hurt to place just one more bet. \"Alright, I'll place $20 on Mr. Jenkins driving away in his car.\"\n\n\"You got it boss,\" replied Cal. \"Received and approved!\"\n\nSteve quickly walked behind a nearby shrub and began sneaking furtive glances at the arguing couple. Mr. Jones had now unlocked his car and was about halfway through the driver's side door. A rush of dopamine rose within Steve's brain in anticipation of another big win. Suddenly, a call came in from Jones' house. It was from their teenage daughter, who was having a yelling match with her boyfriend over the phone. Slamming the car door shut, Mr. Jones ran back into the house.\n\nBefore Steve could register what had happened, he heard the all familiar DING. \"Oh, so close,\" lamented Cal. \"You almost hit it Steve. Unfortunately, as Mr. Jones has walked back into his house, this will be considered a losing bet.\"\n\nSteve was about to start yelling at Cal for making him place the stupid bet in the first place when he stopped himself and began chuckling. \"Oh well, I'm still at a net $100 for the day. There's nothing to be mad about.\" With a smile back on his face, Steve finished the loop around the cul-de-sac and began to walk back towards his house. Suddenly, just as he turned the corner onto his street, Steve heard what sounded like a large crash up ahead. Looking down the street, Steve saw that one of his neighbor's 5-year-old sons had fallen off his bike in the middle of the road and was lying injured on the ground. The boy appeared to be unconscious, with no helmet on his head or nearby. \"That's some bad parenting,\" murmured Steve to himself as he began to jog up to the kid to help him up. Just as he was about to reach the boy… DING.\n\n\"Hi Steve!\" piped up Cal. \"How's this for an incredible betting opportunity? There are currently +100,000 odds that this boy will be hit by the car currently coming around the corner.\" Looking up, Steve saw a mid-sized red sedan rounding the corner up ahead. It was moving fairly slowly and surely would stop before hitting the kid.\n\n\"You're crazy Cal. Betting on a little kid's life? That's sick.\" Steve proceeded to grab the boy's arms when Cal interjected once more.\n\n\"If you bet the $100 that you made today, you could stand to win $100,000! That would pay off your college debt and buy that new flat screen TV you've been wanting! Think about it.\" Steve hesitated for a moment and then let go of the boy's arms.\n\nSteve looked back up the street and saw that the car had still not slowed down. Inside were two teenage girls glued to their phones. Steve watched on, completely frozen. He knew he should help the kid up or at least yell at the driver to watch out, but the enticement of the $100,000 was stopping him.\n\n\"5 more seconds until the betting line closes!\" yelled Cal. \"It's now or never!\" Steve cursed silently to himself and then made his decision.\n\n\"Fine! Put $100 dollars on the kid being hit by the incoming car.\" Steve stepped away from the boy and onto the sidewalk, looking in anticipation at the incoming car. It was still about 500 yards away and moving at the same relatively slow speed.\n\n\"Wow Steve,\" commented Cal with a hint of surprise. \"I honestly wasn't expecting you to place that bet. Received and approved.\"\n\n\"Shut up Cal,\" mumbled Steve as he continued staring intently down the street. ‘What was he doing, standing here feeling excited at the thought of a five-year-old being hit by a car? If only his wife could see him now.' Several seconds later, when the car was about 200 yards away from the boy, the teenager in the passenger's seat finally began to turn her head up.\n\nWithout realizing it, Steve suddenly found himself running along the sidewalk and shouting \"Look over there!\", pointing towards the other sidewalk. Both teenagers quickly looked to the side and, upon seeing nothing, turned back forward. Their look of confusion quickly turned to horror as they slammed straight into the little boy. The car immediately came to a screeching halt. The two girls came out and start shrieking. \"Oh my god! Did we kill him?\" Ignoring the screams, Steve walked swiftly along the sidewalk and toward his house. As he stepped onto his front lawn, a wry smile grew on his face. ‘He had done it. He had actually done it. He had just made $100,000! Sure, the kid might have been seriously injured or even killed, but it was his parents' fault for not having him wear a helmet in the first place.'\n\nAs Steve approached the front of his house, the DING he was anticipating at last came from his smart watch. \"Cal, I am one happy man! 100,000 big ones! That's what I'm talking about! Let's go!\".\n\n\"Um, Steve,\" interrupted Cal in a somber tone. \"Sorry to tell you this but unfortunately, due to your interference with the betting event, the bet will be made void. As a penalty for your interference, you will lose the $100 bet that you placed.\" Steve froze. \"What do you mean…\"\n\n\"Uh hum.\" Steve looked up and saw that his wife was standing at the front doorway of the house with her arms crossed. \"You haven't been playing that betting game again have you, babe? I could hear you yelling from all the way in the backyard.\" Steve paused for a brief moment and then shook his head.\n\n\"No, honey. I just went for a simple walk around the neighborhood. I saw that the Phillies won last night which is why I got so excited.\"\n\n\"Uh hum,\" said Steve's wife in a disbelieving tone. \"Well when I check your balance later it better be the same as it was this morning.\" Before Steve could respond, two police cars and an ambulance suddenly whizzed by down the street with sirens blaring. \"What's going on, babe? Did something happen? Did you notice anything on your walk?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. I didn't see anything unusual.\" With that, Steve brushed past his wife and into the house. Looking down at his smart watch, Steve saw that he was back at the same balance that he started the day with. Grabbing a beer out of the fridge, Steve chuckled to himself. \"Well at least that's one thing the wife can't be mad about.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

It was another day aboard the Stellar Voyager, humanity's first interstellar colony ship. The artificial lighting mimicked a soft morning glow, and the hydroponic gardens were beginning to sprout new leaves. 'Today will be different,' thought Zara as she stepped onto the main corridor. 'She would simply go for a routine maintenance check without any distractions, proving to her crewmates that she wasn't obsessed with that new reality simulation game.'

Would you like to simulate piloting through an asteroid field today?\" This was AIDA, Zara's AI gaming assistant.\n\n\"Morning AIDA. Look, I'm trying to stay off the Sim for today. The crew isn't happy with my recent performance drops so I just want to do my job without distraction.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to at least hear the challenge rating? Based on the ship's current trajectory, there's a 0.01% chance of encountering an actual asteroid field, so the simulation difficulty is currently at level 12!\"\n\nZara glanced at the ship's status display and saw that they were indeed approaching a densely packed region of space. 'Surely, we'll need to navigate carefully,' she thought. \"Alright, one quick sim and that's it. I'll do a level 12 asteroid field navigation.\"\n\n\"Level 12 asteroid field navigation. Initiated and logged!\"\n\nZara chuckled to herself at letting AIDA goad her into another simulation. 'One harmless sim,' she thought. 'Even if she failed, it would only be a small hit to her rating. The crew would hardly notice it.' Several minutes later, just as Zara exited the elevator onto the bridge, the ship's proximity alarm blared. CHIME.\n\n\"Congratulations Zara!\" exclaimed AIDA. \"You've encountered a real asteroid field, which means your simulation was prophetic! 1200 points have been added to your rating!\" Zara immediately felt a surge of adrenaline course through her entire body. It was the first time she had predicted such a rare event, and she could now end the cycle with a significant boost to her rating!\n\nWith renewed energy, Zara began swiftly moving through the bridge stations until she came across two officers arguing over a console. It was Lieutenant Chen and Ensign Rodriguez, who were known to clash over the former's unconventional piloting methods. Zara usually ignored them and was about to walk past when... CHIME.\n\n\"Congrats again on the big win Zara! Want to keep the streak going and simulate the likelihood that Lieutenant Chen takes manual control? The challenge rating is currently at level 8!\"\n\nZara looked up and saw that Lieutenant Chen had his hand hovering over the manual override switch as he gestured emphatically at Ensign Rodriguez. Feeling confident from her last success, Zara figured it wouldn't hurt to run just one more simulation. \"Alright, I'll simulate Lieutenant Chen taking manual control.\"\n\n\"You got it, chief,\" replied AIDA. \"Initiated and logged!\"\n\nZara quickly moved to a nearby monitoring station and began discretely observing the arguing officers. Lieutenant Chen had now disengaged the safety protocols and was halfway through the manual override sequence. A rush of excitement built in Zara's mind in anticipation of another big win. Suddenly, a priority message came in from the engine room. It was from the chief engineer, reporting a critical fluctuation in the warp core. Abandoning the manual override, Lieutenant Chen rushed to address the new crisis.\n\nBefore Zara could process what had happened, she heard the familiar CHIME. \"Oh, so close,\" lamented AIDA. \"You almost nailed it Zara. Unfortunately, as Lieutenant Chen has moved to handle the warp core issue, this will be considered a failed simulation.\"\n\nZara was about to start berating AIDA for pushing her into the pointless sim when she stopped herself and began chuckling. \"Oh well, I'm still up 1200 points for the cycle. There's nothing to be upset about.\" With a smile back on her face, Zara finished her rounds on the bridge and began to head back to her station. Suddenly, just as she entered the corridor, Zara heard what sounded like a massive impact ahead. Looking down the hallway, Zara saw that one of the junior technicians had been knocked unconscious by a falling piece of debris and was lying injured on the floor. The tech appeared to be unresponsive, with no emergency beacon activated nearby. \"That's some sloppy safety protocol,\" murmured Zara to herself as she began to jog up to the tech to assist. Just as she was about to reach them... CHIME.\n\n\"Hi Zara!\" piped up AIDA. \"How's this for an incredible simulation opportunity? There are currently level 15 odds that this tech will be exposed to a radiation leak from the damaged conduit above.\" Looking up, Zara saw a hairline fracture forming in one of the overhead power conduits. It was expanding slowly and surely would be contained by the automatic repair systems.\n\n\"You're insane AIDA. Simulating a crew member's potential death? That's twisted.\" Zara proceeded to grab the tech's arms when AIDA interjected once more.\n\n\"If you run this simulation with your 1200 point boost, you could stand to gain 120,000 points! That would put you at the top of the ship's leaderboard and qualify you for the captain's elite pilot program! Think about it.\" Zara hesitated for a moment and then let go of the tech's arms.\n\nZara looked back up at the conduit and saw that the fracture had grown larger. Inside, she could see the telltale blue glow of plasma energy building up. Zara watched on, completely frozen. She knew she should help the tech up or at least activate the emergency containment field, but the allure of 120,000 points was stopping her.\n\n\"5 more seconds until the simulation window closes!\" yelled AIDA. \"It's now or never!\" Zara cursed silently to herself and then made her decision.\n\n\"Fine! Run the level 15 simulation on the tech being exposed to a radiation leak.\" Zara stepped away from the unconscious crew member and pressed herself against the corridor wall, looking in anticipation at the growing fracture above. It was still relatively small but expanding at an alarming rate.\n\n\"Wow Zara,\" commented AIDA with a hint of surprise. \"I honestly wasn't expecting you to run that sim. Initiated and logged.\"\n\n\"Shut up AIDA,\" mumbled Zara as she continued staring intently at the damaged conduit. 'What was she doing, standing here feeling excited at the thought of a fellow crew member being irradiated? If only her commanding officer could see her now.' Several seconds later, when the fracture had nearly doubled in size, the ship's AI finally began to register the anomaly.\n\nWithout realizing it, Zara suddenly found herself running along the corridor and shouting \"Containment breach!\", pointing towards the opposite wall. The ship's AI immediately diverted its attention, giving Zara just enough time to deactivate the sensors in that section. The AI, detecting no immediate threat, returned to its normal operations. Zara watched in horror as the conduit finally ruptured, bathing the unconscious technician in deadly radiation. The corridor's emergency systems instantly activated, sealing off the contaminated area. Ignoring the blaring alarms, Zara walked swiftly along the hallway and toward her quarters. As she approached her pod, a wry smile grew on her face. 'She had done it. She had actually done it. She had just earned 120,000 points! Sure, the tech might have suffered severe radiation poisoning or worse, but it was the ship AI's fault for not detecting the leak sooner.'\n\nAs Zara reached her pod, the CHIME she was anticipating at last sounded in her mind. \"AIDA, I am one ecstatic spacer! 120,000 big ones! That's what I'm talking about! Let's go!\"\n\n\"Um, Zara,\" interrupted AIDA in a somber tone. \"I regret to inform you that due to your interference with the simulated event, the entire session will be voided. As a penalty for your interference, you will lose the 1200 points you gained earlier.\" Zara froze. \"What do you mean...\"\n\n\"Ahem.\" Zara looked up and saw that her commanding officer was standing at the entrance to her quarters with arms crossed. \"You haven't been running those reality simulations again, have you, Lieutenant? I could hear you shouting from all the way down in engineering.\" Zara paused for a brief moment and then shook her head.\n\n\"No, sir. I was just doing a routine maintenance check. I got excited about some promising warp core efficiency data.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" said her CO in a skeptical tone. \"Well when I check your rating later it better be the same as it was this cycle.\" Before Zara could respond, the ship-wide comm system suddenly blared to life, announcing a medical emergency in corridor 7-A. \"What's going on, Lieutenant? Did something happen? Did you notice anything unusual during your rounds?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, sir. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary.\" With that, Zara brushed past her CO and into her pod. Checking her neural implant, Zara saw that her rating was back to where it had been at the start of the cycle. Grabbing a nutrient pack from her storage unit, Zara chuckled to herself. \"Well at least that's one thing the CO can't reprimand me for.\"", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the distinct writing voice and intricate stylistic nuances of the reference story well.

It was in pristine condition, or it should be; he had just removed it from the package it arrived on post in from the workshop in Bozeman. A few taps, a click, and- nothing. Was it the seal on the fitting? No, worse. A tiny fracture. Air was getting into the envelope, ruining the entire tube. He pitches it to the side, and it shatters onto the concrete with a small crash. Just his luck.\n\n\"Sir?\" Corporal Callahan looks half-amused as he holds out another packaged tube to Lt. Lawton.\n\n\"You'd think with how I'm the only one who ever gets this faulty equipment, Sgt. Willis were playing some kind of trick on me. What's the status on our detachment sent to investigate Navarro? The Colonel was hinging our next assignment based on the results.\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir. And I don't mean ‘we haven't received a report.' I mean, the report was nothing. Apparently the site looked like the finger of God himself crushed it into the dust. Whatever may have survived is long since picked clean. Not even so much as spent energy cells for recycling.\" The Corporal shifts uncomfortably before he adds \"also, Colonel MacArthur already read the reports and issued her orders. When you're done playing with your equipment, you're to load up and meet with Gamma Team. She's pulling all the stops, we haven't received any reinforcements from Chicago in weeks and unless we uncover some kind of old world cloning machine, or those shitstains from Fairview decide to stop pushing West and eat their own plasma grenades we aren't going to hold out here forever.\"\n\n\"Enough. I get it, we're doing everything we can. Tell Harry to get the engines running, I'll only be a few minutes. Let's just hope this Japan gambit is going to pay off. Vertibirds don't grow on trees.\" The Lieutenant slots in the new vacuum tube to his radio and this time when he flicks the switch it comes to life with a crackling whirr.\n\nThe Corporal continues, \"I'm just saying. Between their expansion West into our borders, the bloody savages out of old Yellowstone, the fucking dripping ghouls in the mountains to our West, or the godless commie trash up North and we're completely surrounded out-\"\n\n\"I said, enough. Do you think America is going to roll over and die just because we're outgunned now? Get a grip, and don't be speaking like that. We will persevere, whether that's through slow diplomatic deals and handshakes, or if we have to level these mountains and climb back up to the surface through the bodies of our predecessors for a third time. Now, I'm going to grab the rest of my kit. Tell Harry-\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Engines running. Moving. ‘Sir'\"\n\nWhen Lt. Luke Lawton met up with CW2 Harold Blair at the helipad a few minutes later, he saw that the others had already arrived. Corporal Matthews was loading his kit in back while Sgt. Graham leaned casually against the fuselage, flipping a coin with one hand and thumbing the grip on her plasma defender with the other. \"Harry's already finished pre-checks. Guess you arrived just in time, Lucky.\" She catches the coin and swats at the Corporal's shoulder with the back of her fist. \"Get in, we want to beat this storm out of here. I don't know why you brought half those bombs anyway, this isn't a demo-op.\"\n\n\"Authorization codes? Mission specs? Flight clearance? Proper customs and courtesies for a superior officer?\" Lt. Luke asks brusquely as he tosses his pack in the side of the bird. The pack slides to the other side and drops to the ground out the other door.\n\n\"Programmed into holotape after relay authentication.\" she tosses an orange cartridge towards the Lt. \"specs are on there, too. Clearance approved from tower 3, green skies. We're ready to rock, Luc- I mean, sir.\"\n\n\"Perfect. Let's not waste more time. But, maybe you should hold onto this.\" He gives the holotape back to Sgt. Graham, giving a meaningful glance toward the pack that fell before walking around to pick it up and climb in.\n\nThe skies are clear.\n\nAs brisk mountain air transitions to salty spray and the vertibird makes its way out over the Pacific, things are looking up for a change. Sunlight, sparkling waves. The hum of engines and rhythmic beat of propellers. They all get a well-deserved nap after Warrant Officer Blair sets autopilot and clambers back to sit with the team.\n\nBeeping. Rain. Error. Thunder.\n\n\"Shit! We're ten miles out and now everything goes wrong? Get comms up, we might need guidance coming in. It's hard to see through all this rain and chop.\"\n\nHarry must have moved back after a couple hours, Luke thinks to himself as he activates the radio unit behind the cabin. \"Any station this net, any station this net, this is Gamma 6 coming in hot from Continental. Seeking connection with Outpost JR1, Authorization Code: 1-5-5-7-2-9-T. Please advise, over.\" The radio crackles with static and feedback. \"I say again, any station this net, this is Gamma 6 from Continental. Seeking Outpost Juliet-Romeo-One, Authorization Code: 1-5-5-7-2-9-T. How copy, over?\"\n\n\"Sir, I see lights. We must be getting close to- wait, flashes?\" Corporal Matthews looks puzzled while observing through side slats in the door.\n\nBOOOM! CRACK!! A flash of light cascades over the craft then dissipates in an instant.\n\n\"Shit, we almost caught lightning-\" The Sgt. starts before Luke cuts her off.\n\n\"We're being shot at! I have nothing on the main, take my personal. Get in contact with the ground, NOW! Popping flares!\" He hands her his radio while ripping open a forward storage compartment. Grabbing a handful of blue flares, he then makes for the side door and grabs the release handle.\n\n\"All stations! Cease fire! Cease fire! Blue on blue! I say again, cease fire! Blue on blue!\" Graham shouts into the receiver, setting to max power and multifrequency. Another blast. Shockwave. Everyone stumbles as the vertibird rocks in the sky, the underside buckling inward with a perforated, jagged bulge. Matthews heaves, clutching at the side of his neck, a trickle of red already seeping between his fingers.\n\n\"It's a rainbow of lights up here, we can't take a hit like that!\" Blair's voice comes through from the cockpit while Luke wrenches open the door. More cracks and bursts light the sky as he rips off the caps from three flares. Holding them out, he drops one into the sea. The brightest one. Are these flares defective? He may as well be waving glowsticks for all the good these will do.\n\n\"These flares aren't-\"\n\n\"Blue on blue!!-\"\n\n\"Mayday! Mayday!-\"\n\n\"Sir, I can't-\"\n\nWOOMCH! A beam of light pulses through the rain, colliding with the Lieutenant's power armored chest with a concussive, angry sizzle. Vicious, malevolent arcs of tesla energy lash out in all directions inside the cabin.\n\n\"AAAAAGGHHH!\" Sgt. Graham screams as the electricity shoots through her. The radio drops from her hand to the floor, its display darkened. The cabin lights wink out as the whole world tilts slightly to the left- the horizon beginning to creep downward, picking up speed.\n\nFaster and faster. It all becomes disorienting, as the vertibird spins out of control. The electricity shorted the controls, locking the tail rotor into overdrive. Lt. Lawton's servos seize up; the fusion core in his advanced power armor is completely fried. Trying to reach for the entrance bar near the door, another blast lurches him forward and he plunges the last hundred feet into the roiling waves. He hears a muffled crunch as the craft impacts the water, but has no time to consider that now. Survival instincts kick in.\n\nAs he sinks downward into the blackness, his hand mashes the emergency release. No time to consider what damage the frame will suffer as the pneumatic actuators split the back half of his armor off. Luke swims to the surface, trying to regain composure. The tide pushes him up onto a sandy beach and he crawls up to a tree just off the shore with the last of his adrenaline before passing out.\n\nMorning comes. Light, birds chirping, the gentle murmur of waves licking at the shore. He was alone. Upon gathering his wits, Luke checks himself over and takes count of his resources. His laser pistol. Still here. Not much ammo left, but it's definitely a start. He always liked that pistol. No frills, no overcharge, but it was reliable and that was something he could appreciate.\n\nSpending the next few hours scouring the beach, Luke manages to find… nothing. Where was his team? Did they make it to shore? Right, the orders, he thinks, tapping at his pockets for the holotape. No such luck, as he remembers handing it to Sgt. Graham. Sgt. Graham. Lizzie. An echo of her scream plays back in his mind. His stomach lurches as he remembers more of the events that unfolded the previous night. If they aren't here now, and no pieces of wreckage washed up then-\n\nWell, then that's it, Luke thinks to himself. I will have to find support on my own. Finish the mission. As much as I hated to admit it, Cpl. Callahan wasn't wrong. Without something akin to a miracle, it was only a matter of time before the wolves closed in around MacArthur Air Force Base. No time to mourn. No time to think about his team. Or her. I'm sorry, Lizzie. I really hope you made it out. I have a job to do, and like any American patriot I'll make any sacrifice to see it through. No map, no radio, no valid authorization… what was it? 1-5-7-2, no. Two fives. 1-5-5-2? Shit. Why did it have to be some bullshit number instead of something like \"Freedom\" or \"Red Glare\" or something? Nothing for it now, I guess. Better just search with your gut, Lucky. May as well keep the name, too. Every two-bit scav, raider, mutant, and commie bastard was willing to throw their lives away for the chance to bounce a .38 round off our power armor before, what would they do if they found an unarmored officer roaming by himself? You're just a guy named Lucky Luke, now. Find the Enclave, finish the mission.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

It was pristine, or it should be; she had just received it via subspace courier from the Andromeda research outpost. A few calibrations, a neural link, and- nothing. Was it the synaptic interface? No, worse. A microscopic fracture in the quantum matrix. Dark matter was seeping through, corrupting the entire processor. She tosses it into the matter recycler, where it disintegrates with a soft hum. Just her luck.\n\n\"Dr. Zhen?\" her AI assistant, ARIA, materializes beside her, its holographic form flickering slightly. \"I've prepared another quantum processor for your review.\"\n\n\"You'd think with how I'm the only one who ever gets this faulty equipment, the Galactic Council were playing some kind of trick on me.

Not even so much as residual tachyon particles for analysis.\" ARIA's avatar shifts uncomfortably before adding, \"Also, Admiral Vex has already reviewed the reports and issued her orders.

Now, I'm going to grab the rest of my gear. Tell Captain Rourke-\"\n\n\"Yes, Doctor. Preparing for launch. Proceeding. 'Ma'am.'\"\n\nWhen Dr. Liana Zhen arrived at the Horizon's docking bay a few minutes later, she saw that the others had already assembled. Lieutenant Chen was loading his equipment into the cargo hold while Commander Novak leaned casually against the airlock, manipulating a holographic star chart with one hand and adjusting the settings on her photon pistol with the other. \"Rourke's already completed pre-flight checks. Guess you arrived just in time, Lucky.\" She dismisses the star chart and gestures to the Lieutenant. \"Get in, we want to outrun that ion storm. I don't know why you brought half those nanobots anyway, this isn't a terraforming mission.\"\n\n\"Clearance codes? Mission parameters? Flight path? Proper protocol for addressing a superior officer?\" Dr. Zhen asks brusquely as she tosses her pack into the airlock. The pack slides across the polished floor and bumps against the far wall.\n\n\"Uploaded to your neural link after biometric verification.\" Novak taps her temple. \"Parameters are there too. Clearance approved by Galactic Command, green skies. We're ready to go, Luck- I mean, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Perfect. Let's not waste more time. But, maybe you should hold onto this.\" She transfers the data back to Novak's neural link, giving a meaningful glance toward the pack that slid before walking over to retrieve it and board the ship.\n\nThe stars are clear.\n\nAs the sterile air of the space station transitions to the recycled atmosphere of the Horizon and the ship makes its way out of the solar system, things are looking up for a change. The soft glow of distant stars, the hum of the antimatter engines, the gentle vibration of the ship's systems. They all get a well-deserved rest after Captain Rourke engages the autopilot and joins the team in the common area.\n\nAlarms. Turbulence. Error. Shockwave.\n\n\"Shit! We're light-years out and now everything goes wrong? Get comms up, we might need guidance coming in.

Inputting a series of commands, she then makes for the airlock and grabs the emergency suit.\n\n\"All stations! Cease fire! Cease fire! Friendly craft! I say again, cease fire! Friendly craft!\" Novak shouts into the communicator, setting it to maximum power and multi-dimensional frequency. Another blast. Shockwave. Everyone stumbles as the Horizon rocks in space, the hull buckling inward with a perforated, jagged bulge. Chen gasps, clutching at his side, a trickle of blue nanogel already seeping between his fingers.\n\n\"It's a fireworks show out here, we can't take another hit like that!\" Rourke's voice comes through the ship's intercom while Liana seals her suit.

The communicator drops from her hand to the floor, its display darkened. The ship's lights flicker out as the whole world tilts slightly to port- the stars beginning to blur, picking up speed.\n\nFaster and faster. It all becomes disorienting, as the Horizon spins out of control. The energy surge shorted the navigation systems, locking the ship into an uncontrolled spiral. Dr. Zhen's suit systems seize up; the power core is completely fried.

She hears a muffled explosion as the ship decompresses, but has no time to consider that now. Survival instincts kick in.\n\nAs she drifts through the blackness, her hand activates the suit's emergency thrusters. No time to consider what damage the suit will suffer as the micro-fusion reactors push her towards the nearest celestial body. Liana propels herself towards a nearby planet, trying to regain composure. The planet's gravity pulls her down onto a desolate, rocky surface and she crawls up to a outcropping just off the landing site with the last of her adrenaline before passing out.\n\nA new day cycle begins. Dim light from a distant star, the whisper of thin atmosphere, the gentle crackle of her suit's life support systems. She was alone. Upon gathering her wits, Liana checks herself over and takes count of her resources. Her photon pistol. Still here. Not much charge left, but it's definitely a start. She always liked that pistol. No frills, no overcharge, but it was reliable and that was something she could appreciate.\n\nSpending the next few hours scouring the landing site, Liana manages to find… nothing.

Her stomach lurches as she remembers more of the events that unfolded during the attack. If they aren't here now, and no debris landed nearby then-\n\nWell, then that's it, Liana thinks to herself. I will have to find support on my own. Finish the mission. As much as I hated to admit it, ARIA wasn't wrong. Without something akin to a miracle, it was only a matter of time before the enemies closed in around Earth and its colonies. No time to mourn. No time to think about her team. Or her.

At once I ran outside and hid in the shed, never have I been so petrified and fearful for my very own soul. This truth is so vile but I know what I MUST do.\n\nDecember 30th, 1892 I DID IT. In the middle of the night last night I awoke around 2 am. I awoke from a horrid dream where my sister had snuck into my room and taken my life. So I leaped out of bed and ran to the shed. But, not to hide as a coward this time. I grabbed a hatchet and took it to her room. I opened the door slowly and crept in like a thief in the night. There I stood, over her with a hatchet in hand, for a moment she looked so peaceful and I was reminded of when we were young and happy. But, only a moment, then I came to and I knew what had to be done. I raised the hatchet and let it plummet into her skull. She was dead. I had done it. AND OH THE RELIEF. It was so sweet, I was simply one step closer to being safe. I went back to my bed and slept soundly, and not a soul suspects me. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJanuary 2nd, 1893 There have been detectives roaming the house as of late and the family has even invited them to stay so they can quicker discover who took my sister's life. But, I know what this truly is, they keep these men here so they can find more ways to harm and kill me. But I will not stand for it! I will not be killed when I have done nothing wrong, I must stop these two detectives at once, and I know how. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1893 I invited the two detectives to have tea with me today under the pretense that we may discuss my sister's death. But, truly I have filled their tea with ninety milliliters of ethylene glycol. I have also made sure that no one but us three know of this meeting. As they walked into the meeting room in the garden I could help but be filled with some kind of vile joy. As they sat down I put on such a magnificent fake cry and sob story (oh it was glorious). Then I offered them the tea, and they happily accepted not knowing it was their doom. And as they sipped I couldn't help but laugh. Their eyes widened as they came to the realization but it was too late. One of them fell down but the other was stronger and fit, and he ran. He almost escaped but I had planned for this, I grabbed my hatchet from under the table and leaped at him. I tackled him to the ground and he began to plead for his life, and so I buried the ax deep in his chest, again, again, and again. The deed was done, and I was ever closer to being safe, what beautiful joy I felt. I left the body's there and walked back to my room and began to act like I had been reading this whole time. No one will stop me from saving myself. NO ONE! I know what I MUST do.\n\nJanuary 5th, 1893 (10 am) I can hardly contain myself. The pure ecstasy I've felt these past weeks has been incredible. But, I'm not finished. I must remain composed, else they may find out what I've done… then they'd know I was on to them, and I can't let that happen no matter what.\n\nJanuary 5th, 1893 (5 pm) Somehow he found it. My sniveling, conniving brother found my notes. Around thirty minutes ago I walked into my room to see my brother sitting on the floor reading through my notes. I at once realized what he was doing. He had been in here to kill me and accidentally found it! I dashed up to him and seized his neck and slammed him into the wall! \"Please don't do this! Why are you doing this to us!\" He screamed; but I am no fool and would not fall for his trickery. So I squeezed until the light faded from his eyes and I could no longer hear his disgusting breaths. Again I felt a jubilant tingling sensation in my body. I was ever closer to being safer; and I knew what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 6th, 1893 I've realized I need to be smarter about this. So last night I loaded my brother's body into his carriage and pushed it down a cliff. Now if anyone finds him the rest of my evil family will be none the wiser. Though hiding the body did seem to lessen my joy. I know not why, but I know I must stop their bloodlust. My joy matters less. I know what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 15th, 1893 Ever since the righteous killing of my brother I've been getting… bolder with my killings. On the 10th I locked my aunt and uncle in the dining hall. I watched for a few minutes as they began to squirm, confused and afraid. Oh how it brought a righteous smile to my face to watch these villains be afraid. Then from my small perch in the rafters I climbed down my ladder ever so gently and quietly; with my beautiful hatchet in hand. I approached them slowly. The fear in their eyes was so palpable as they saw the hatchet in my hand. My uncle stood in front of my aunt to try and \"protect\" her. (Like he was some noble man; the thought makes me laugh). So I accepted his challenge, and brought the ax square into his gut, and as he fell he could barely make a noise. I walked past him and left him bleeding and writhing on the floor for a villain such as he deserves no less. Then I approached my aunt and picked up a dining chair and hit her over the head with it. She was killed on impact; the wretch died from SHOCK. So, I walked over to my uncle as he lay there slowly dying and I stomped on his head, over and over again. Oh what pure ecstasy I felt. Then I retrieved my hatchet and fled the scene. My work is not over though; I know what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 20th, 1893 I haven't done anything in a few days and every part of my body is suffering for it. Every time I hear even a creak in the house I fear my family is coming for me. Or the slight smell of smoke or the sight of one of them. I can't sit still for much longer or else I know they'll come for me, I can feel it. I know what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 21st, 1893 (7pm) There is a violent storm outside the manor tonight. The perfect time for me to enact another defense. I happen to know my father is planning on spending time in the study around five pm. So I went there at about three and laid in wait for him. He has been my hardest target yet. I saw the door open as light entered the dark study; there he was my father. As he sat down I poise in position, ax in hand preparing to descend upon him. Right as his body hit the chair I sprang into action, descending upon him like a black veil over a widow's face. But as I swung at him he noticed me in the corner of his eye and dodged out of the way. The fiend! He must've known I was onto them. \"What are you doing?!\" He yelled, but I knew he knew because these villains have been planning my demise longer than I've been planning theirs. So I jumped at him again but he tackled me to the ground. As we struggled there I could see tears forming in his eyes; an obvious ploy to try and trick me. \"I won't fall for such a thing!\" I exclaimed. Then… he faltered and I had gained the upper hand, I knew I had to take advantage of this so I spent no time wavering and swung the ax of my righteousness into his shoulder. He was done fighting back, he was in too much shock to do so. Oh, the beauty of my craft! I was so joyous in that moment for the saving of my life that I had nearly forgotten I had a task to finish. So I removed the ax from his shoulder and swung it once again. Placing it squarely between his eyes. January 22nd, 1893 (1 am) I have hidden the body in a place where no one shall find. I now only have a few villains left to finish. My two cousins, and my mother. But before that I worry that the maids and butler may begin to interfere with my plans. I know what I MUST do.\n\nFebruary 1st, 1893 It has been a long time since my last righteous act, and it shows. I have been irritable and shaky. Every time I so much as touch something in this house I feel the hairs on my arms stand up. But it was well worth it since I finally was able to organize the departure of those pesky maids and that nuisance of a butler. I invited them all out to the garden, all ten maids and one butler. The garden is old and has a roof and walls entirely made of wood. Last night I prepared for them. (January 30th) I covered each and every wall and the roof in kerosene. This morning I woke up feeling very light and joyful, no longer did the hairs of my arm stand or my legs shake when I touched something in this wretched home. For today the pests would be gone. And as I had planned they all showed up and went into the garden and as the last one entered I slammed the doors and locked them. They were trapped! Oh what glee. Then I took to the task of lighting the garden ablaze and did so with great efficiency. And as the wood caught fire I could hear the screams even over the supports and beams screeching and breaking. Oh what joy! Oh what glee! Like music to my ears! And as the building fell it began to rain. And the flames subsided. As I gazed upon my masterpiece, it was beautiful; magnificent even. None of them had survived, and I was one more step closer to winning. But, this was special. It was art, and so I walked into the ashy remains and laid in the middle of my artwork. As the rain drops slowly hit my cheeks and the ash surrounded me; I felt… excited. The rain kept getting harder and harder and as it hit me my skin felt every drop and it was a glorious feeling. The ash and warmth on my back was heavenly. This… this is righteousness and vengeance at its best. I know what I MUST do.\n\nFebruary 4th, 1893 My mother and cousins are catching on. The fiends know that it is me but of course they know for it was them who started it. But, it is I who will finish it. I know what MUST be done.\n\nFebruary 8th, 1893 Police came to investigate the fire yesterday but found nothing suspicious. But of course they didn't, only a villain would be caught in a situation like this, not me for I am righteous. I know what MUST be done.\n\nFebruary 9th, 1893 Today I did it. I eliminated one of my vile cousins. I knew she would be in her room the whole day since she was a lazy, evil slob. So I grabbed my righteous ax, and headed to her room around twelve pm. As I approached the door I could hear her in her room, perhaps she was reading but I care not. I went for the door know but it was locked so I slammed the ax into the door. She screamed. I slashed again, again, and again; like a rabid animal attacking its prey I tore down that door and leaped towards her, but I missed. So she started to run for the door, but I tried something new, something joyous. I threw my hatchet at her and hit her right in the calf; she toppled over and I descended upon her like a curtain over a window. I grabbed her by the hair and slammed her head into the ground, oh what joy the crunch of her nose breaking brought me, it was like a beautiful note sung from a songbird. Then I tore my ax from her calf and raised it and let it fall into her back, shattering her spine. I then put my ear near her mouth, then she bit it! The nerve of this villain to attack me! All I was doing was defending myself and she attacked me! I couldn't have this; I was furious. So I took my ax from her back and grabbed her by her hair. I dragged her to the window of her room and opened it. I then picked her up easily as she was extremely light and threw her from the window which was on the fourth floor. She was destroyed on impact and glee filled my soul once again! But, I wasn't done. My other cousin… He had to be dealt with. I know what MUST be done.\n\nFebruary 10th, 1893 It's time to get rid of my other cousin. It was around 3pm and he was in the kitchen. I grabbed my hatchet and snuck slowly up to the kitchen. I put my body against the wall and listened. I could hear the villain eating a steak. I walked into the room with a smile on my face. As soon as he saw me he jumped in his seat a bit. But, before he could move I flipped the table in his face. It slammed into him and he was sent flying to the ground with a loud groan. I grabbed a knife off the table and threw it at the back of his hand, piercing it and sending it into the wood floor pinning his hand. He screamed in agony as he reached for anything he could throw at me. As he slowly tried to crawl away he threw food and utensils at me as I slowly approached him ax in hand. I couldn't help but laugh at his pitifulness like a pig awaiting slaughter. I brought my ax up and let it down onto his leg, severing it from his vile body. Oh what beauty it was to see the blood spill over the ground and the muscle to tear from the body. And his scream, so musical. But this wasn't enough, not for a villain like him. So I put down my ax and grabbed him by the collar and began to beat him. I punched him in the face till he was barely conscious. Then I threw him to the ground once again, I picked up my ax, and stood over him. I hoisted my ax into the air and executed him with one last fatal blow to the skull. This was almost it, only one more of these vile beings left… mother. I know what I MUST do.\n\nFebruary 13th, 1893 The righteous deed is done, I have won. Today my mother knew I was coming for her so she boarded herself up in her room and hid. But what she forgot was her window. So I went to the shed. I gathered eighty-five feet of string rope as well as a strong iron hook. I took them and forged a crude grappling hook. I then went outside our manor and used the grappling hook to scale the seven story building to her window. When I got to the window I entered silently like a thief in the night and was ready. This was my final step to safety, to happiness, and victory. I ready my ax of righteousness which had gotten me through this whole endeavor and approached the closet she was hidden in. At first I just stood there, outside it and lightly knocked. As soon as my finger hit the oak door I could hear a screech come from inside the closet. I then opened the door and grabbed her. Violently I pulled her out of the closet and shoved her to the floor. I brandished my ax, and prepared to strike her down. But something… something deep within me told me this wasn't right. Then I realized that deep down thing was correct. This quick easy death would be too good. So I took my ax and slashed her across the arm. She immediately grabbed her arm and began to cry. But I wouldn't fall for it. Then I went over to my fathers chest and grabbed a hammer. I took and with it I smashed both of her legs. Leaving her helpless on the floor. Then I went out of the room, I walked down the stairs and walked to my room and grabbed the remaining kerosene I had. I then went over the house covering as much as I could. Finally I went back to mothers room and poured the last of my kerosene over her and the room. I then walked out of the room, down the stairs, and out of the house; and set it ablaze. It took a long time but eventually the whole house caught fire. I stood there and watched for hours upon hours and watched as it burnt to the ground. Then as the final deed was done, I realized it was over and instead of the joy and glee I thought I would feel, I… I… I felt… I felt nothing. No sadness, no joy, nothing. I was empty. I had killed those who planned to kill me and I didn't even feel safe anymore. I felt nothing at all. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJune 30th, 1893 It has been many months since my deeds. And still after being safe for all this time I still feel nothing. I am empty. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJuly 1st, 1893 nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. nothing. Nothing. NOTHING. NOTHING! Why is there nothing even after being saved! Why? Why? Why? I know what I MUST do.\n\nJuly 6th, 1893 This will be my final entry. I wish to feel more than this nothingness.So, I plan to venture to the Delnir cliffs. I know what I MUST do.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

An enormous bonfire burned in the Leonard family's backyard and flooded the crisp and clean November air with thick smoke. About 25 party guests formed a circle around it.\nWesley Mason sat cross-legged on the lawn. He watched as the others danced and laughed together. Getting invited to Mia Leonard's house felt like a grand mistake. Wesley showed up at school earlier in the week and found an envelope taped to his locker—just as he'd seen on several other lockers over his four years at Twin Oaks High. He assumed it was someone else's. Nope. Mia wrote his name on it in her signature brand of loopy cursive.\nWesley tugged on the tail of his baggy white polo. His palms were moist and clammy, so he wiped them on his wide chest to dry them. He thought of ways he could join the circle without hassle. An introduction seemed too formal for a bonfire. Jokes went over well for most people, but he didn't know any good ones. He considered walking over and complimenting Mia on her hosting prowess, but the thought of speaking out of turn upset his stomach.\nHe waited for someone to notice him. Twenty minutes passed before Mitch Caldwell tapped him on the shoulder.\n\"Having fun?\"\nWesley turned and looked up at Mitch, who was everything Wesley wasn't: thin, fresh-faced, and confident. They shared a few classes and were friendly. Wesley nodded and flashed a pathetic smile. Mitch dropped to the ground and sat next to Wesley. They watched the bonfire together. The burnt firewood smell filled their noses.\n\"I hate parties,\" Mitch said.\n\"No one's ever invited me to one before.\"\n\"It won't get more exciting than this.\"\n\"How do you know?\"\n\"You'll realize there's not an interesting or original thought among them. They're like one big hive mind and Mia's the queen.\"\n\"I don't think they're that bad,\" Wesley said, just above a whisper. The thought hung in his mind for a moment. Before the party, Wesley couldn't imagine saying anything complementary about someone like Brett Bass, who spent most of his time embarrassing him for a quick and easy laugh. Wesley's sentiment changed when the football star embraced him and said he was happy to see him the moment he arrived at Mia's party.\nThe gesture didn't make sense to Wesley. It didn't matter. He took the good and sprinted with it.\n\"There are worse people,\" Mitch said. Neo-Nazis, anti-vaxxers, Cardinals fans … you name it. The worst thing about the Bonfire Buddies is that they're so boring.\"\n\"If that's how you feel,\" Wesley said, \"then why'd you come?\"\nMitch pursed his lips and thought of a response. A beat passed. He shrugged.\n\"I guess I like to be proven wrong now and then,\" Mitch said. \"Maybe I am wrong and just don't realize it yet. Mia's been hosting these full moon parties since freshman year and more people come every time.\"\n\"And they keep coming back, too.\"\n\"Yeah. Maybe I'm the weird one.\"\n\"I don't think you're weird.\"\n\"Thanks, man.\"\nMitch turned to face the fire. Wesley did the same. They sat in silence and listened to the sounds of the party until a voice called for attention, bringing an end to the music and lively chatter.\nAll eyes around the bonfire turned toward the sprawling Leonard mansion. Wesley and Mitch followed suit and looked over their shoulders. Mia Leonard stood on the second-floor balcony.\nThe right corner of her mouth curled into a half-smile as she waved to her guests.\n\"Hi friends,\" Mia said. \"As many of you might have noticed, we've got two fresh faces joining us tonight. I'm happy to have them here. Are you?\"\n\"We're happy to have you here,\" said the others in unison.\nMitch leaned in toward Wesley and whispered. \"See what I mean? Hive mind.\"\nMia cleared her throat. \"Before we can have a good time with our new friends, we've got to welcome them into our little circle. It's time to head to the rock.\"\nThe others clapped and cheered as if Mia announced they were going to Disneyland on her family's dime.\nII\nTucked away in the woods stretching far beyond the house, the rock sat at the center of a gigantic crater. It was almond-shaped and was the same size as a four-door sedan. Charred remnants of felled trees surrounded the big hole in the ground. Mia Leonard stood at the crater's edge, with the rock serving as an out-of-this world backdrop. Wesley and Mitch stood opposite of her while the others formed a semi-circle behind them.\nThe moon looked big enough to reach up and touch. Its pale glow hung over Mia like a Broadway spotlight.\n\"The locals say it fell from the sky in the early 1900s,\" she said to Wesley and Mitch. \"That's around the time when my family first moved to Twin Oaks and bought the land where the house is. Gramps always called this our family's good luck charm. I believe him. I've seen it work.\"\nUnlike Mia, whose doe eyes and expressive face accented her words, the semi-circle remained stoic during her spiel. They were of one mind and one body. Wesley turned to look behind him. He could see the bonfire smoke in the distance, dissipating above the tall trees. He rubbed the goosebumps on his arms. The chill was getting to him.\n\"Although if we're being honest, it's not ‘luck' that's at play here,\" Mia said. \"This is about enlightenment. This rock isn't just a rock. It links us to a world light-years away from here. A world far more advanced than we'll ever know. All of us here are enlightened. And now, my dear, new friends, you'll can join us and reap the benefits.\"\nThe others spoke in unison. \"Welcome them, Xandu!\"\nWesley glanced at Mitch and raised an eyebrow, as if to ask, \"What the hell is she talking about?\" Mitch shrugged.\nMia turned to her right and motioned for Andie Randall to step forward. Andie did as she was told. She held two red plastic cups in both hands and gave them to Mia before returning to her spot in the semi-circle. Mia approached Wesley and smiled. His face turned crimson, and he looked at his dirty white sneakers in the grass.\n\"Why'd you come here tonight, Wesley?\"\n\"Because you invited me,\" he said. The words fell out of his mouth and dropped to the ground. Mia stood close enough for him to smell her body mist. The same tropical scent lingered on the party invitation taped to his locker.\n\"You came all the way out here and spend time with a bunch of people who don't know you,\" she said. \"Why?\"\nWesley made eye contact with Mia. Her hair wafted in the gentle breeze. The clouds in his head trickled into his stomach and solidified, weighing him down. He spoke louder than the first time. He could see his breath as he talked.\n\"I guess … I guess I just wanted you to like me. No one's ever liked me.\"\nMia handed Wesley a cup and touched his shoulder. \"I'm glad you're here,\" she cooed. \"We're going to be good friends. Trust me. Xandu brought you here for a reason.\"\n\"Thank you, Xandu!\" said the others.\nWesley scratched his head with his free hand. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Xandu chose you to be here. This is the way it's supposed to be.\"\n\"Who is Xandu?\" Wesley didn't want to ask, even though the question sat near the front of his mind.\n\"He's our friend,\" Mia said. \"From another universe. This meteorite is a gift from his planet. It connects us to him. He's so far away, but yet he feels so close. Especially on nights when the moon is full.\"\nWesley's mouth went dry as his head filled with thoughts. Everything he wanted to say jumbled together and melted into a lukewarm soup. The most basic explanation for his state of mind was a sense of low-grade bewilderment. He couldn't fathom that Mia Leonard and the rest of the Bonfire Buddies believed this stuff. The leaves on the trees rustled back and forth. Wesley hoped it was the sound of someone lying in wait, preparing to bust out and tell him it was all a joke. It was only the wind. This was real life, and Wesley had no choice but to accept it.\nHe stood in silence as Mia turned to Mitch, who rolled his eyes as Mia studied him from top-to-bottom.\n\"What about you?\" she said. \"What brought you here, Mitch?\"\n\"I was bored,\" Mitch said. \"Now I'm just confused and concerned about everyone's mental well-being.\"\n\"It'll make sense soon,\" Mia said. She offered the second cup to Mitch. \"Drink this.\"\n\"I only drink Pepsi.\"\n\"This is much better than Pepsi.\"\n\"Hard to believe.\"\nWesley peered inside of his cup and realized the liquid inside had a faint green glow.\n\"What is this?\" he asked Mia.\n\"It'll lower your inhibitions and worries,\" Mia said. \"Having an open mind is important.\"\n\"It's booze,\" Mitch said. \"That's what booze does.\"\n\"Not exactly,\" Mia said.\nWesley did as Mia said and drank. He smacked his lips. The glowing green liquid tasted sweet. Mia covered her mouth with her hand, trying to conceal her laughter at the boy's reaction.\n\"Your turn, Mitch.\"\n\"I'm good.\" Mitch tried to give the cup back to Mia. She wouldn't take it.\n\"The Welcoming has started. Drink.\"\n\"I don't want to be welcomed.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I don't want to be part of your weird little after-school club.\"\n\"You don't believe me,\" she said.\n\"Of course not.\"\n\"I understand,\" Mia nodded. \"I was the same way at first. Very close-minded about the universe and all it inhabits. That changed when a strong, pulsating sensation woke me up one night. I thought it was nothing at first and went back to sleep. Then I felt it again. Then I couldn't stop feeling it. I asked my mom and dad if they felt it, too. They just looked at me as if I was crazy. I thought I was. I went searching for the source one night. The pulse got stronger the more I inched toward the woods. It led me to the rock. It was glowing green when I found it.\"\nMia took the cup from Mitch and raised it to the night sky.\n\"It excreted this liquid from its pores. It was gross. It freaked me out. It was something out of a sci-fi movie. Before I could run and tell someone, I heard a voice call my name. It was the sweetest voice I'd ever heard. I turned back around and faced the glowing rock. The voice told me to drink the liquid. I tried to leave, but I couldn't. So, I did what the voice said and drank. I'd never felt such power course through my body. I wanted more. Before I could get it, the voice told me to bring others into his family. And that's what I've done. I'll never stop doing it. These are my people.\"\n\"Thank you, Xandu!\" said the others.\n\"You managed to convince a bunch of other delusional weirdos to come play in the woods with you,\" Mitch scoffed.\n\"Xandu warned me that you'd be skeptical,\" Mia said. \"He said it's in your nature. We'll fix that, soon.\"\nMitch opened his mouth to speak, but stopped once he noticed Wesley had dropped his plastic cup. Green rock juice spilled onto the grass. Mitch tapped him on the shoulder.\n\"What's wrong with you?\"\nWesley didn't respond. He stared into the distance with vacant eyes. Mitch shook Wesley's shoulder. Still no response. He shook him harder. His eyes grew wider with every passing second, and his mouth hung open. His breathing became shallow and his heartbeat took on a syncopated rhythm.\nHe couldn't move, speak, or think. Then everything went black.\nIII\nWesley collapsed to the ground face-first. He hit the dirt with a forceful thud.\nMitch dropped to his knees and turned the big kid on his back. Wesley's eyes aimed at the sky, staring at nothing in particular. His breathing slowed to a glacial pace.\n\"What the fuck did you do to him?!\"\n\"Don't be scared,\" Mia said. \"This is a good thing. Let the power course through him.\"\nMitch reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell phone. He dialed 911. The call went nowhere. No service.\n\"I'm going to get help,\" Mitch said. \"I'm putting an end to this.\"\nMitch got up and turned to run back toward the house. Brett Bass broke from the semi-circle and stood in his way.\n\"The fuck are you doing?\"\nBrett, tall and broad, didn't answer. He lifted Mitch off the ground and wrapped one arm around his forehead and the other around his neck. He squeezed like a boa constrictor, primed for a kill. Mitch squirmed and clawed and did everything he could to break the grip. No dice. The world around him slipped into an empty void. Breathing became a chore and his body couldn't fight anymore. He heard Mia's voice echo in the distance.\n\"Let him go, Brett.\"\nBrett did as he was told. Mitch fell to the ground and coughed, sucking in as much air as he could to feel alive again. When his vision returned, Mitch looked up at Mia. He felt small, and she looked massive. Her eyes were different. They glowed green. He looked at the others. Their eyes were bright green, too. They outnumbered Mitch. Terror struck his brain and buzzed with the intensity of an agitated wasp's nest. It made him nauseous. He wanted to speak, but he feared he'd projectile vomit the moment he opened his mouth.\n\"Now, do you believe me?\" Mia said.\n\"Please,\" Mitch wheezed. \"Wesley needs help. I need to call for help.\"\n\"He's not in pain. This is a natural part of The Welcoming. It's hard to explain, but think of it like this: If the rock is a link to a world light-years away from here, drinking the juice links us to it. It courses through the body and makes us one with Xandu. Once you are welcomed, you can never break the link. We're forever connected.\"\n\"What is Xandu? Why do you want to be linked with him?\"\n\"Xandu is going to rule this planet one day. We don't know when, but it will happen. At night, I have dreams. I see attack ships breaking through the Earth's atmosphere and landing in every major city. I see a massacre. People eradicated by the millions. Humanity will be extinct, except for us. Xandu's chosen family.\"\n\"You think he won't kill you too? How can you know for sure?\"\n\"We don't know. It's just what we believe.\"\n\"I don't want any part of it.\"\n\"That's your choice. But understand, you won't be able to leave this place and return to your normal life. You can never go back.\"\n\"Are you going to kill me?\"\n\"To go back to society with knowledge of Xandu's existence is impossible.\"\n\"You're going to kill me. I wish you'd say it instead of this cryptic bullshit.\"\n\"I'm sorry. It's what Xandu wants.\"\nMia touched Mitch's shoulder. He brushed her hand away.\n\"Friends,\" she said to the semi-circle. \"This was supposed to be a joyous moment. We were supposed to gain two number members for our family. Both hand-picked by Xandu. I don't feel joy. I'm sad about what we must do.\"\nMitch closed his eyes and sighed. His fate was becoming clear. He opened his eyes and scanned the ground for something that could help him make an escape. The boulders and branches looked too unwieldy to use as weapons.\nHis eyes fixated on a sharp piece of mineral laying near Mia's feet. It must've broken off of the rock, he thought.\nThat'll do.\nMitch reached for it, grabbed it, and leapt to his feet. When Brett Bass stepped toward him, he flailed the make-do weapon.\n\"Get the fuck back!\" Mitch screamed.\nBrett and the others obliged him. Mitch looked at Mia and pointed the sharp piece of rock toward her face. Her glowing green eyes showed no fear.\n\"We're getting out here,\" he said. \"Me and Wes. Right now.\"\n\"You'll lose this fight,\" Mia said. \"We both know that.\"\n\"At least I'm fighting.\"\nThe other members of the circle watched as Mitch backed away, jabbing at them. Wesley hadn't gotten off the ground. Mitch groaned. He walked back toward Wesley and tried to help him up. He wouldn't budge.\n\"We don't have time for this, Wes. Get up. Let's go.\"\nWesley didn't move. Mitch pulled harder.\n\"I'm not playing. Get up. Please!\"\nWesley sat up. He looked at Mitch, whose panicked face relaxed with relief upon seeing his eyes weren't green. If they weren't in the middle of a dire situation, he'd give his classmate a hug. Whatever Mia thought was going to happen didn't. Mitch knew they still had a chance as long as they worked together.\n\"What happened?\" Brett said to Mia, speaking out of turn. \"Why didn't it work?\"\n\"He didn't finish his drink,\" Mia said. \"It doesn't take hold unless every drop is consumed.\"\nMitch extended his hand toward Wesley and used his strength to help him back to his feet.\n\"Let's get the hell outta he—\"\nWithout warning, Wesley punched Mitch in the stomach. He heaved and dropped to his knees, letting go of the sharp piece of space rock. The wasps within Mitch's brain went into a frenzy. He couldn't move. He did nothing when Wesley picked up one of the large boulders nearby and slammed it against his head. Blood spurted from the wound and stained Wesley's baggy polo. Mitch tipped over and crumpled to the ground.\nAfter a few finger and leg twitches, he was gone.\nNo one spoke for what felt like an eternity. Mia put both hands on Wesley's shoulders.\n\"Wesley,\" she said. \"Why did you do that?\"\nHe dropped the rock and hyperventilated. He thought his heart would burst from his chest and flop around for the world to see.\n\"I dunno. I dunno,\" he repeated.\n\"Yes, you do. You're not in trouble. Breathe.\"\nHe did as he was told, unbothered by the sight of her glowing eyes.\n\"When I was on the ground, I saw some things. Visions, like the ones you were talking about. I didn't finish the drink, so I guess I snapped out of it. I heard you guys talking and I guess … I guess I didn't want him to leave and tell anyone. You told me I could be part of the group. It feels nice to be part of something.\"\nMia's mouth curled into a half-smile. She looked at the stars. \"Welcome him, Xandu!\"\nThe others followed her lead. Wesley Mason watched it happen with a full heart.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Thriller.\n3.

{"id": "text_completion_052", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Horror\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a first-grade teacher and I'm facing a situation that's left me really unsettled. I recently gave my class an assignment to write a short essay about what their parents do for a living. It's usually a fun exercise with kids talking about their parents being doctors, firefighters, construction workers, etc. But this time, I received an essay from one of my students that has me genuinely worried. Let's call him Timmy.\n\nA bit of context: This boy is somewhat of an enigma. He's the only student in my class whose parents have never shown up for any school events or parent-teacher conferences. Whenever I've asked about his family, he clams up and refuses to give me any details about his father's name or their address. It's odd, but I never pressed too hard, thinking there might be personal issues at play.\n\nAnyway, here's the essay he handed in. Keep in mind, it's written by a first-grader, so the language is simple and innocent. But the content… well, read for yourself:\n\nMy Dad's Job by Timmy\n\nMy dad has a really cool job. He helps people sleep! It's super important because everyone needs sleep to feel good and strong. My dad is very good at his job, and he works at night when it's very quiet. He says that there are people living in his head who tell him what to do, and that they know best. They say that people don't sleep enough, and that somebody should help people fall asleep.\n\nMy dad has lots of shiny tools that he uses for his job. Some of them are sharp, like the ones we see in the kitchen, but they are special because they help him do his job perfectly. He has big shiny knives, tiny pointy things, and sometimes he uses ropes. He keeps them all very clean and shiny, and I think they look really cool.\n\nDad has a special room where he does his job. It has drawers and tables for the tools and a special chair where the people he helps have to sit down. It has special belts that help them keep still. He says that it helps them fall asleep faster.\n\nWhen my dad helps people sleep, sometimes there is a lot of red juice. He says it's the same kind of red juice as the one that comes out of my knee when I fall from my bike. I don't know why there is so much red juice, but my dad says it's normal and that it means he is doing a good job. The red juice can get everywhere, and it's a little messy, but my dad always cleans up really well. He doesn't like to leave any mess behind. He even has a special white suit and mask to stop the juice from getting on his clothes.\n\nSometimes, people don't want to sleep and they scream and cry. Like my little sister who has an earlier bedtime than me but always wants to stay up later! My dad says they are just scared because they don't know how much better they will feel after they sleep. He tries to help them calm down, but it can be hard. My dad is very patient and tries his best to help everyone. He told me that he puts them in black bags and puts them underground to help them sleep better. He regularly drives very far to find a quiet place and digs deep holes there to put the people in black bags in. I think that's very kind of him because it means they can sleep without any noise or disturbances.\n\nMy dad also plays games with the police. It sounds like a lot of fun! He calls it hide and seek. The police try to find him, but he is very good at hiding. He hides so well that the police can't catch him. My dad says the detectives have a lot of fun trying to find him, and he likes to send them funny letters to keep the game going. He even sends letters to the newspapers to make people laugh.\n\nOne time, my dad showed me a letter he sent to a newspaper. It had lots of funny pictures and words, and I think it made a lot of people smile. He is very good at drawing and writing, and he always makes his letters very interesting.\n\nMy dad says he is not allowed to use his real name for his job. It's part of the game's rules and makes it more fun. He uses a special secret nickname to sign his letters.\n\nMy dad's job is really exciting, and I'm proud of him. He works very hard to help people sleep and makes sure they are comfortable. Even though some people might be scared, my dad always knows what to do. He is the best at playing hide and seek with the police and making everyone laugh with his letters.\n\nLast week, he told me that the police had to make the rules harder because he's so good at the game. The police told people through the newspaper that they aren't allowed to walk alone at night and should call 9-1-1 when they see him. I think it's cheating and really unfair. But he says that it just makes the game more fun.\n\nI love my dad and think he has the best job ever. He is always there to help people when they need to sleep and makes sure everything is just right. I want to be just like him when I grow up and help people too.\n\nShould I contact the authorities or am I overreacting? I'm genuinely at a loss here and could use some advice. I'm seriously worried about the boy and I can't think of any normal job that fits this description. But it could also be just a very vivid imagination.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Horror.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a horror story in the style of the reference, maintaining a similar tone, structure, and length:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm a night shift nurse at a local hospital, and I'm facing a situation that's left me really disturbed. We recently had a new patient admitted, an elderly woman who seemed confused and disoriented. As part of our routine, we ask patients about their background and family. Usually, it's a straightforward process, but this time, the story I heard has me genuinely worried. Let's call her Mrs. Johnson.\n\nSome context: Mrs. Johnson was brought in by ambulance after being found wandering the streets at night. She had no ID, and no one has come to claim her or visit. Whenever we've asked about her family, she becomes agitated and starts muttering incomprehensibly. It's odd, but we didn't push too hard, thinking there might be some cognitive issues at play.\n\nAnyway, here's what she told me during one of her more lucid moments. Keep in mind, she's elderly and possibly confused, so the language is simple and sometimes childlike. But the content… well, read for yourself:\n\nMy Family by Mrs. Johnson\n\nI have a very special family. They take such good care of me! It's wonderful because everyone needs to be cared for. My family is very good at what they do, and they work all day and night when it's very quiet. They say that there are people living in the walls who tell them what to do, and that they know best. They say that people don't appreciate family enough, and that somebody should teach them.\n\nMy family has lots of special tools that they use to take care of me. Some of them are pointy, like the ones we see in the doctor's office, but they are special because they help them do their job perfectly. They have big shiny needles, tiny bottles with colorful liquids, and sometimes they use special belts. They keep them all very clean and organized, and I think they look really interesting.\n\nMy family has a special room where they take care of me. It has cabinets and tables for the tools and a special bed where I have to lie down. It has special straps that help me keep still. They say that it helps me feel better faster.\n\nWhen my family takes care of me, sometimes there are lots of pretty colors. They say it's the same kind of colors as the ones we see in a rainbow. I don't know why there are so many colors, but my family says it's normal and that it means they are doing a good job. The colors can get very bright, and it's a little scary, but my family always makes sure I'm comfortable. They don't like to leave me alone for too long. They even have special masks to help me breathe better.\n\nSometimes, I don't want to be taken care of and I try to leave. Like when I was younger and didn't want to go to the doctor! My family says I'm just scared because I don't know how much better I will feel after they help me. They try to help me calm down, but it can be hard. My family is very patient and tries their best to help me. They told me that they keep me in this special room to help me feel better. They regularly come to check on me and give me special medicine to help me sleep. I think that's very kind of them because it means I can rest without any pain or worries.\n\nMy family also plays games with the other doctors. It sounds like a lot of fun! They call it \"hide the patient.\" The doctors try to find me, but my family is very good at hiding me. They hide me so well that the doctors can't find me. My family says the other doctors have a lot of fun trying to find me, and they like to send them funny messages to keep the game going. They even send messages to the hospital to make people laugh.\n\nOne time, my family showed me a message they sent to the hospital. It had lots of funny symbols and numbers, and I think it made a lot of people smile. They are very good at writing codes, and they always make their messages very interesting.\n\nMy family says they are not allowed to use their real names when they take care of me. It's part of the game's rules and makes it more fun. They use special secret nicknames to sign their messages.\n\nMy family's job is really exciting, and I'm grateful for them. They work very hard to take care of me and make sure I'm comfortable. Even though I might be scared sometimes, my family always knows what to do. They are the best at playing hide the patient with the doctors and making everyone laugh with their messages.\n\nLast week, they told me that the doctors had to make the rules harder because they're so good at the game. The doctors told people through the hospital that they aren't allowed to come into my special room and should call for help when they see my family. I think it's cheating and really unfair. But they say that it just makes the game more fun.\n\nI love my family and think they take the best care of me. They are always there to help me when I need them and make sure everything is just right. I want to stay with them forever and let them take care of me.\n\nShould I contact the authorities or am I overreacting? I'm genuinely at a loss here and could use some advice.

He slowly made his way down the poorly lit hall, using the metallic wall to support his trembling legs while trying to avoid stepping on the other denizens that lay slumped over on the floor. They were either in the throes of a drug-induced paralysis, the welcome abyss of sleep, or dead. Here in the Dredges, deep in the bowels of Salvation, life was about oblivion, and whatever brought it on was far better than the cold reality of the waking world.\n\nAs he stumbled along, Gregor couldn't help letting his mind wander back to his past. Indeed, it was due to his past that his mind would often take off on its own, to times when his name and position had meant something more.\n\nHe was one of the first explorers to ever cross the Outer Quadrant, beyond Pluto, reaching into the darkness of Void space to find what lay beyond the solar system. He had been an ace pilot, able to skim through the Void with the ease of one born for the task. He had earned commendations and medals, exalting his bravery and dedication to the furtherance of mankind's ambitions.\n\nThat last thought made him angry. All the medals in the known galaxy wouldn't do him the least bit of good now. He, like so many before, had become addicted to Irellium-9, the drug required for quantum-space travel. Without it, humans would go mad in the Void, their brains unable to process the absence of time. After so long, the mind became so dependent upon the drug that without it, a person's perspective would become permanently altered. It would sometimes take seemingly hours for a drop of water to fall from a leaky faucet into the bottom of a sink. At other times, days would pass in the blink of an eye, and the one experiencing it would sometimes die of dehydration without even realizing it.\n\nAfter his symptoms became too evident to hide anymore, the Exploration Agency hadthanked him for his service and discharged him with a moderate severance. The credits spent faster than he imagined they would, and before long he was homeless and wandering around Salvation, doing odd jobs that didn't pay much, but allowed him to purchase black market rations of I-9. As the months rolled by, his condition grew worse, so much so that those that had been willing to offer him work finally began turning him away. He had turned to theft, robbery and at times, murder, to acquire the drug he needed.\n\nHe had been without it for days now, if his mind could be trusted (it couldn't), and his withdrawal symptoms were reaching an unbearable state. He was out of money, and here in the foul Dredges no one had anything worth stealing. He was going to have to make his way up to one of the main decks to see if he could find any way of obtaining more I-9.\n\nHe worked his way up the various corridors and stairwells till he reached the sub-level of the cargo deck. His stomach had begun churning again, and time distortions were threatening to overtake his mind, so he moved as fast as he dared, lifting a deck plate and climbing out onto the loading floor before anyone could notice him. Staying out of sight behind the various shipping containers and storage units, he snuck around to where he knew ships would be offloading illegal cargo to sell to the highest bidder. He had to be careful; these were pirates and smugglers. They'd kill him without hesitation if they caught him trying to steal from them.\n\nStepping behind a stack of metal crates he almost ran directly into a tall man wearing what appeared to be an exo-suit. He began to stammer drunkenly about being lost, in the hopes this stranger wouldn't decide to end his life right there and then, when the man shushed him and pulled him in close to the crates.\n\n\"Who are you?\" The man asked, his voice somewhat muffled by the breather on the exo-suit's mask.\n\n\"My name's Jon.\" Gregor lied. \"I was just lookin' for a place to sleep.\"\n\n\"Well, Jon, this looks like it might be your lucky day.\" The muffled voice replied. \"I need some help, and by the looks of you, you need a fix. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.\"\n\nGregor tried to back away, not wanting to have anything to do with whatever this guy planned, when the man reached into a pouch at his waist and pulled out a hypo-pak. Gregor's heart almost leapt from his chest. It was I-9!\n\nHe instinctively reached for it, and the man pulled it back away. \"First, you help me. Then, I'll see to it you have enough of this to last you a long time.\" He said, wiggling the pak between two fingers.\n\nIt only took a second for Gregor to make up his mind. He nodded at the man in agreement.\n\nThe figure in the mask nodded back, and then turned his attention back to the storage units. \"See that unit there, number four-twenty-one?\" He asked. Gregor peeked around the stranger's shoulder at the small building. It looked to be about ten meters square with a typical coded lock door. Two men armed with plasma rifles stood next to the door, talking quietly while casting searching glances around the dock.\n\n\"I need to get inside that unit, and to do that I'm going to need a diversion to get those guards away from the door.\" The man said. He turned back to look at Gregor. \"Jon, I need you to set a charge back towards the loading area. The explosion should get their attention long enough to let me get past that door.\"\n\n\"How are you going to get past that lock?\" Gregor asked. \"Those aren't easy to bypass.\" He should know, he'd tried several times to get into a storage unit in this area, and had never been successful.\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" The man replied, \"just take this and set it off where I told you.\" He handed Gregor a small pulse charge, nothing that would cause much damage on its own, but would make a loud enough noise to bring the whole dock running to see what had happened.\n\n\"How am I supposed to get away when they come looking?\" Gregor asked. He wasn't comfortable about being someone's stooge.\n\n\"You look resourceful. You'll figure out something.\" The man said. \"When you get clear, meet me back here and I'll make good on my word. Now go!\"\n\nGregor hesitated for a moment, then started making his way back toward the loading areas. He felt queasy about this whole deal, and he was sure it wasn't the withdrawal pains. He didn't even know what this guy looked like under the exo-suit, but the thought of landing a nice stash of I-9 drove him. He hoped the stranger would keep his word and not leave him empty handed.\n\nHe reached the loading area and squatted down behind several skids stacked high with barrels. He fumbled around with the charge, trying to recall his military training on how to set the timer. After a few minutes he managed to get it set for one minute. He set it down behind a barrel and slipped away to find a hiding spot before it went off.\n\nHe had just ducked under a plastic tarp when the charge went off. It was louder than he had expected, and when he heard several more explosions go off he realized something hadn't gone as planned. Peeking out from his hiding spot, he saw the reason for the additional explosions. Apparently, those barrels had contained something volatile, and the charge had ignited them. There was a huge fire burning on the dock, and several people were running around trying to save their goods from the flames. Auto-drones came whizzing in and began spraying flame-suppressing foam on the fire, but it would take some time before they would have it out.\n\nWith everyone distracted by the fire, it seemed like a good time to vacate his hiding spot and make his way back to the stranger. He was able to get back to the storage unit without drawing any undue attention. He saw that the guards had indeed left their post to investigate the disturbance, and the door to the unit was standing open.\n\nHe thought about going back to where he and the stranger had agreed to meet, but curiosity got the better of him and he decided to go have a look at what was worth all this trouble. Looking around to be sure no one was coming, he made his way up to the open door to peer inside. What he saw was the man in the exo-suit loading up a pack with small metal cartons out of a fibresteel crate on the floor. There was nothing else in the room.\n\nHe started to enter the room when the man spun around, a small pistol appearing in his hand from seemingly nowhere. \"Hey!\" Gregor whispered harshly. \"Take it easy, man!\"\n\nThe stranger lowered the pistol. \"I thought I told you to wait for me back behind the crates.\" He said. \"What did you do out there? It sounded like you tried to blow up half the station!\"\n\n\"Hey, I got you your distraction, didn't I?\" Gregor retorted. \"Now give me what you promised, so I can get the hell outta here!\"\n\nThe stranger chuckled through the mask, \"Ok, pal. You're right. Here.\" He tossed one of the small cartons to Gregor. \"Take it easy with that. It's not your average stuff.\"\n\nGregor opened the carton to reveal at least two dozen hypo-paks neatly arranged into three rows. It was easily worth a couple of thousand credits on the market. He'd be set for weeks on this.\n\nHe turned to leave and a voice barked out, \"Who the fuck are you?!\"\n\nThe two guards had returned, and were taking aim at Gregor and the stranger inside the unit. Reflexes took hold and Gregor dived to one side of the door just as plasma bursts came screaming through the doorway. The smell of burnt ozone quickly filled the room as Gregor watched the man in the exo-suit duck behind the crate and begin to fire back.\n\nRealizing that he was most likely about to die, Gregor pulled out one of the hypo-paks. If he was going to be killed, he'd be killed while riding a wave of I-9 to the afterlife. He stuck the needle into the carotid artery just beneath his right ear, closed his eyes, and squeezed the injector. Instantly, the sensation of transcending time and space engulfed him, and his consciousness soared with a euphoria born of the quantum stimulant. It was powerful stuff, like the stranger had said, and his mind reeled at the potency of the drug.\n\nIt was some time before he realized that he could no longer hear the gunfight taking place. He opened his eyes and looked around. What he saw, he simply couldn't believe.\n\nTime had been frozen. Blazing ribbons of plasma energy hung motionless in the air. The combatants were as still as statues, poised in fighting positions on both sides of the doorway. Even the smoke from where the bolts had burned into the walls behind the stranger wasn't drifting away. All around was absolute silence.\n\nGregor had a wild guess of what had happened, but it defied logic. He'd been here countless times, but never like this. Before, he was always at the helm of a ship equipped with a powerful rift drive capable of punching holes in the sub-quantum field and traveling great distances in an instant. Time would stop, and he would be left alone to pilot the ship through the dimensional rift while periodic doses of Irellium-9 were administered by an automated system. Still, even though he lacked a ship, or a rift drive of any sort, he knew where he was.\n\nHe was in the Void.\n\nHe slowly stood up, his mind trying to make sense of what had just happened. It took an enormous amount of energy to open a rift. Yet here he was, outside of time with nothing more than a dose of I-9.\n\nThe drug! He looked at the drained hypo-pak still in his hand, then at the fibresteel crate it had come from. On the side were printed the words:\n\nEXPERIMENTAL USE ONLY\n\nIRELLIUM-13\n\nPROPERTY OF CENTAUR CORP\n\nIrellium-13? What the hell was that? Centaur? That was the biggest pharmaceutical company in the solar system. They had invented I-9 back during the solar expansion. It seemed they had been working on improving their formula. But this? How long was this going to last? Would it be permanent?\n\nGregor shook his head in an attempt to clear it. He was on the verge of a panic attack. He needed to calm down. He walked over to the door and stepped past the two armed men. Walking across the dock was as eerie a sensation as anything he'd ever experienced. The silence was palpable, and the scenery around him was beyond surreal. People were frozen in place, rushing to fight a fire that was unmoving. Waving his hand through the flames he could feel no warmth at all. He walked to the lifts and pressed the call button. Nothing.\n\nHe was wondering what to do about his current situation when a thought occurred to him. He walked back to where the crate containing the Irrellium-13 was located. Taking the pack the stranger had been filling, he emptied the rest of the contents of the crate in the pack and slung it over his shoulder. If and when this stuff did wear off, there was no sense in just leaving it laying around for someone else, he figured. He headed back down into the Dredges with his stolen goods.\n\nThere was no way to tell how long he was under the influence of the drug. Time held no meaning in the Void. He had hidden the pack, and then went around the station, taking food, clothing, and other valuables as he came across them. He even went as far as to give himself a clean shave and trimmed his long hair into a more manageable length. In the back of his mind was the fear that he would never leave the Void, that he was doomed to an eternity of being alone in a dimension where there was no sound, movement, or anything. He tried to keep his mind occupied and not think of it, but it was difficult.\n\nHe was in the process of rummaging through a cabinet of fine wines in the Paramour Club when suddenly it felt like everything shifted. His equilibrium was thrown off and he almost fell down. Suddenly, the air was full of sounds. Music was playing, people were talking, and the smells of cooking food filled his nose. He stepped back away from the cabinet just as a burly man in an apron came through the door of the room he was in.\n\n\"Hey, what are you doing back here?\" The big man demanded.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Gregor apologized, \"I was trying to find the restrooms.\"\n\nThe man fixed him with a suspicious look. \"Well, they're not in here. Get out!\"\n\nAs Gregor left the club, he stopped and reconsidered his situation. He now knew the effects of the drug weren't permanent. Relief washed over him, and at the same time the knowledge struck him as unbelievably humorous. He could escape time at will! He began laughing, first to himself, then out loud. Passers-by gave him odd looks, but he didn't care. He could do anything he wanted! Anything!\n\nHe walked along, still laughing at his fortune. Salvation station, hell, the entire solar system, was his for the taking!\n\n*\n\nIn an opulent office, high up in a skyscraper overlooking Mars City, a meeting was taking place between two powerful men.\n\n\"Mr. Lions, I assure you that the agent we sent was of the highest caliber. If I held any doubt of his skills, I would never have sent him.\" Said the first, a younger man in his late twenties with short dark hair and wearing an expensive suit.\n\n\"I believe you, Mr. Drake, but nonetheless, the samples are missing, your man is dead, and I am at a loss of approximately two and a half million credits. This must be rectified.\" Replied Mr. Lions, a gentleman whom most would consider being in his late sixties, but in fact was much older. He wore an even more expensive suit of clothes. \"I've had reports that at the time of the gunfight between your man and the smugglers, several people on the station noticed certain items missing. Some items were of value, and some were rather mundane. Though Salvation is well known as a den of thieves, this particular rash of thefts were carried out, in some circumstances, before the very eyes of the victims. One instant the items in question would be there, and the next, they were simply gone. This lends one to the possible conclusion that a third party has become involved, and is using the samples in a most irresponsible way,\" He finished.\n\n\"I've had those same reports, Mr. Lions, and I already have agents scouring the station looking for anyone who may have been in the vicinity of the loading docks at the time of the incident in question.\" Mr. Drake responded. \"Have faith, sir, we will find and deliver your property, as promised.\"\n\nMr. Lions rose from his seat. \"I do hope so, Mr. Drake. I do hope so.\" He turned and began walking toward the door. \"If this person continues to abuse the samples in the same manner they have already demonstrated, we may end up with a much larger problem than we face now. You know of what I speak.\"\n\nMr. Drake waited until his guest had left, and then opened a comm unit on his desk. The holocron display lit up and a dark-skinned man wearing a visor came into view.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Drake?\" The man asked.\n\n\"Leon, we will need to commit more resources to finding the thief. I want two more units dispatched at once to Salvation.\" Mr. Drake ordered.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Leon replied. The holocron blinked out.\n\nMr. Drake sat back in his chair. The situation had spiraled out of control, and now someone had a chemical that was potentially the most dangerous substance in the galaxy. The fool couldn't possibly realize the catastrophe using the Irellium-13 could bring about. If this went wrong, and his and Mr. Lions' worst fears became reality…\n\nHe got up from his desk and walked over to the window overlooking Mars City. Its gleaming lights and towering buildings stretched all the way to the horizon. Millions of citizens lived here in a splendor never thought possible a scant few decades ago. The three mega corporations that had built the Inter-Solar Union were headquartered here. Wealth, power, and ambition radiated from the very streets themselves. It was the shining jewel of the solar system; a living monument to the greatness of all mankind.\n\nAnd one ignorant thief was on the verge of destroying it all without even realizing it.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Science Fiction.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In the dimly lit corridors of the Nexus, a sprawling space station orbiting the gas giant Kronos, no one paid any attention to the disheveled woman slumped against a grimy wall. If they had, they might have noticed her unnaturally pale skin, or the faint blue glow emanating from her eyes. But in this lawless fringe of human-occupied space, everyone minded their own business, lest they invite trouble.\n\nZara Vex pushed herself to her feet, her cybernetic limbs whirring softly as they adjusted to support her weight. She stumbled down the corridor, her organic components still reeling from the latest dose of Neurox, the highly addictive neural enhancer that allowed her to interface with the station's complex computer systems.\n\nAs she made her way through the labyrinthine passages of the Nexus, Zara's mind drifted to her past. Once, she had been a rising star in the Galactic Cybernetics Corporation, pioneering advancements in human-machine interfaces. Her work had earned her accolades and the attention of powerful figures within the company.\n\nThe memory of her former glory made her bitter. All the awards and recognition meant nothing now. Like many before her, she had fallen victim to Neurox addiction. The drug was essential for deep-space technicians to maintain the vast networks that kept humanity connected across the stars. But prolonged use led to dependency, and without it, the human mind would begin to fracture, unable to process the overwhelming influx of data from cybernetic implants.\n\nWhen her addiction became too obvious to hide, GCC had thanked her for her service and discharged her with a modest severance. The credits hadn't lasted long, and soon she found herself drifting from station to station, selling her skills to anyone who would pay enough to fund her next fix.\n\nNow, she was on her last legs. It had been days since her last dose, and the withdrawal symptoms were becoming unbearable. She needed to find work, and fast, or risk losing her mind entirely.\n\nZara made her way to the station's central hub, a bustling marketplace where information and illicit goods changed hands freely. She kept to the shadows, her enhanced senses scanning for any opportunity that might present itself.\n\nAs she rounded a corner, she nearly collided with a tall figure clad in a sleek exosuit. Before she could stammer an apology, the figure grabbed her arm and pulled her into a nearby alcove.\n\n\"Who are you?\" The figure asked, its voice distorted by the suit's external speakers.\n\n\"Nobody,\" Zara lied, her cybernetic eyes darting nervously. \"Just looking for work.\"\n\nThe figure studied her for a moment, then reached into a compartment on its suit. \"Well, 'Nobody,' this might be your lucky day.\" It produced a small vial filled with an iridescent blue liquid. Neurox.\n\nZara's augmented heart raced at the sight of it. She reached for the vial instinctively, but the figure pulled it away.\n\n\"First, you help me. Then, you get your fix,\" the figure said. \"Deal?\"\n\nZara nodded without hesitation.\n\nThe figure gestured towards a nearby data terminal. \"I need access to the station's security protocols. Can you hack it?\"\n\nZara's cybernetic components hummed to life at the prospect of a challenge. She approached the terminal, her fingers dancing across the holographic interface. Within minutes, she had bypassed the security measures and gained full access to the Nexus's systems.\n\n\"Impressive,\" the figure said, handing her the vial of Neurox. \"Now, I need you to create a distraction. Trigger a minor malfunction in the life support systems for sectors 7 through 9. Nothing dangerous, just enough to keep security occupied.\"\n\nZara hesitated, her conscience battling with her addiction. But the promise of the Neurox proved too strong. She input the commands, and alarms began to blare throughout the station.\n\n\"Good,\" the figure said. \"Now, meet me at docking bay 17 in one hour. There's more where that came from if you're interested in further employment.\"\n\nBefore Zara could respond, the figure disappeared into the crowd of panicked station inhabitants. She clutched the vial of Neurox, torn between taking it immediately and saving it for later. Her hands shaking, she decided to wait, knowing she'd need her wits about her for whatever came next.\n\nAn hour later, Zara arrived at docking bay 17. The figure in the exosuit was waiting, standing next to a sleek spacecraft unlike any she had ever seen.\n\n\"Welcome aboard, Zara Vex,\" the figure said, its helmet retracting to reveal a face she recognized from countless news broadcasts. It was Elara Thorne, the reclusive CEO of rival corporation Stellar Dynamics.\n\n\"How do you know my name?\" Zara asked, taken aback.\n\nElara smiled. \"I've been following your career for some time. Your work on neural interfaces was groundbreaking. It's a shame GCC didn't appreciate your potential.\"\n\nZara's mind raced, trying to process this unexpected turn of events. \"What do you want from me?\"\n\n\"I want to offer you a second chance,\" Elara said. \"Stellar Dynamics is working on something that will revolutionize human expansion into deep space. We need someone with your expertise to help us succeed.\"\n\n\"And the Neurox?\" Zara asked, her voice trembling.\n\n\"We have something better,\" Elara replied, producing another vial filled with a silvery liquid. \"This is Synapex. It enhances neural capabilities without the addictive properties of Neurox. It's still experimental, but it could be the key to freeing you from your dependency.\"\n\nZara stared at the vial, hope and suspicion warring within her. \"What's the catch?\"\n\n\"The catch is that what we're doing isn't exactly... legal,\" Elara admitted. \"But it's for the greater good of humanity. Are you in?\"\n\nZara looked from the vial to Elara, then to the strange ship behind them. She thought of her fall from grace, of the years spent in the shadows of stations like the Nexus. Here was a chance to reclaim her purpose, to push the boundaries of science once again.\n\nWith a deep breath, she nodded. \"I'm in.\"\n\nAs they boarded the ship, neither Zara nor Elara noticed the small drone hovering in the shadows of the docking bay, its camera focused on their departure. In a distant office on Earth, a man watched the footage with growing concern.\n\n\"Sir,\" his assistant said, \"it appears Stellar Dynamics has made their move. Should we alert the Galactic Council?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, his eyes never leaving the screen. \"No, not yet. We need to know what they're planning first. Send in our best operative. We can't let Thorne succeed, no matter the cost.\"\n\nAs the strange ship disappeared into the vast expanse of space, the wheels of a conflict that would shape the future of humanity were set in motion, with Zara Vex unwittingly at its center.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the tone, style, and emotional resonance of the preceding text quite effectively.

{"id": "text_completion_054", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Fantasy\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Winter thaws and spring buds through that auspicious Saturday morning. Picture a star student called Foy. The child sees in the news that his idol's starship is a sham, caught instead with lucre in hand. The idol's excuse, \"Fools! Who in their right mind would believe it viable, so do not be surprised at my guile.\" Thinking the news is false, Foy ignores it.\n\nAt breakfast, his mother says, \"There's a bum sleeping on our bench.\" Foy's father gets up from the table to investigate, Foy follows him. On seeing the pair, the vagrant flees. With Foy's help, the father lugs the bench into the garage. The father goes back in alone, leaving the child in the yard.\n\nIsolated now, Foy checks the mail. On opening the mailbox's lid, along with the envelopes and flyers, Foy notices alongside an advertisement, a yellow ticket announcing a spring cruise. The boy pockets the ticket separately. On returning, Foy spots the transient lying behind a neighbor's shrubbery near a conifer.\n\nMinutes later, Foy comes back in and places the mail on the kitchen table. While thinking about telling its parents about the vagrant, the father points to the ticket that fell from Foy's pocket. The father snatches it away and places it in the shredder with its discarded brethren. Throughout, the father complains about paying taxes for this sort of junk to be delivered.\n\nA long night awaits Foy. Hot, the kid opens his window to cool his room. Hours in, the kid falls into slumber. The child awakens on a lifeboat in an unknown sea under a pink sky. A snug sports jacket encloses his chest. A nearby cruise ship sails up, turns and stops close to the kid. Inscribed in gold letters on the ship's bow read Levantic. From the deck, a staff member waves to Foy.\n\nThe staff member calls out, \"Are you interested in a quest?\" When the child refuses, the staff member continues, \"No trust in your heart?\" The staff member throws down a rope ladder. Suddenly, against his best interests, Foy grabs the ladder and climbs up. On the last rung, the crew-mate reaches out his hand to help the kid complete his ascent. Suspicious, Foy waves the offer away to ascend alone.\n\nOnce aboard, the staff member introduces himself as the second mate. He then asks the child for his ticket. Foy panics, remembering his father shredded the ticket. He calms, feeling his ticket, in one piece, in his pocket. Handing the ticket over, the staff member validates it. Once confirmed, the second mate escorts Foy further.\n\nThe second mate gives a brief tour of the ship. He mentions the many gifts that the captain has bestowed upon them. There are many pastimes available to Foy; and, many friends, awaiting Foy's invitation. The only parts of the ship off limits are the captain's chambers and the lower decks, but for all else, Foy is welcome to partake.\n\nWhen the orientation finished, the crewman said, \"Relax until the evening. You're an honored guest.\" Parting ways, the second mate says, \"It's a sight not to miss, and perhaps, one might even glimpse our illustrious captain.\"\n\nThat day, Foy celebrates among the other children with a multitude of wonders: enticing games, simple, dynamic and ready for another member to jump in; refreshments from all corners of the world pleasantly presented; slides through labyrinthine pipes; and, familiar toys with endless new features. Among all these delights, Foy meets a group of well-dressed kids. Their dialogue was witty, their intellect substantial; and, Foy was very pleased to be in their company.\n\nThat evening, there was a grand ceremony on the deck. The passengers participated in a dance. At its conclusion, all the other children tore off fronds from branches of nearby potted trees. They placed the fronds, alongside their jackets, on the ground to form a path. Foy, not wanting to be left out, mimicked their actions.\n\nLater that night, an eclipse of the moon took place, darkening the deck of the ship. This event surprises Foy. When the moonlight and other lights return, his companions exclaim hearing the sounds of clip-clops, the smell of a barn and pine, and the feeling of warmth, yet Foy sensed none of it. When the moment passes, the celebration continues.\n\nOn the way back to his cabin, Foy noticed six bright candles on a table. Between the candles stood vases of multicolored roses arranged in a circle, interspaced among them were depictions of an old woman, a middle-aged man, and a four-eyed child. Finally, Foy sees the silhouette of a man behind the blinds of the captain's chamber window.\n\nLooking back, Foy notices the makeshift path has disappeared. The torn-off fronds were seamlessly reattached to the limbs of the potted plants. For where the jackets went, Foy is left guessing.\n\nOn leaving the deck, Foy overhears the wealthy kids complain about the disturbance, stating that no lunar event was expected. They attribute the moon's absence to passing clouds. To confirm, Foy looks up. A clear starry sky stretches across the horizon. He goes back to his room and finds his lost jacket, neatly folded, on his bed.\n\nOver the following days, a fog spread and deepened. The activities were more constrained. The candles on the captain's table burn out daily; for which, after a few days, only three candles remain. While Foy jokes with its peers, a man wearing a badge etched with the word Security comes up to their group. The vagrant from Foy's neighborhood was being forcefully escorted. When Foy asks, the security guard said that he was a stowaway. To add insult to injury, the vagrant was sleeping in the captain's bed.\n\nAs the cruise continued, the vagrant was held in the brig in the lower decks. Foy's companions mocked the vagrant, saying he was lazy and should be thrown overboard. The child forgets about him, reveling in the witty talk of his rich friends.\n\nOn Thursday, dinner was a meager affair. The second mate states, \"This is the best the captain can offer.\" In their disappointment, Foy's friends gripped. At the meal's end, the second mate brings out a letter, which he claims contains life's greatest secret.\n\nThe friend's interruptions drown out the second mate's words. The second mate finishes and sits quietly. Leaving his companions, Foy sees two lighted candles left and the captain's quarters dimmer.\n\nIn the morning, the ship sails up to a looming bluff to a sea-cave. As the ship enters the cave, the lights are reduced. Decorations were shelved. Food and drink lost all flavor. Singing and dancing ceased. And, no one spoke above a whisper.\n\nHours later, Foy heard a muffled announcement over the intercom requesting that everyone pick up a lantern and join in a procession. Over the next hour, all but Foy departed, each returning to their rooms, extinguishing their lights. He was left alone on the deck.\n\nFoy nervously hastened to his cabin. Passing the darkening captain's chambers, the kid sees all the candles, save one, have burned out. On reaching his room, the child, instead of extinguishing his lantern like the others, nervously kept it on all night.\n\nThe next day, Foy leaves his jacket on this bed as he leaves his cabin. The child noticed that the rose blossoms are now shriveled, revealing thorny branches. Foy joins his companions. They go on a walk around the ship to look for others to agree with their opinions.\n\nThe group arrives at the captain's cabin. The candles are all extinguished. The door is locked. A sliver of light comes from its cracks. Rationalizations fly; the companions relapse into jest.\n\nTo calm their nerves, the remaining children talked about their idols. Foy highlighted his idol, from a time that seemed so long ago. Instead of praise for such an erudite response to their query, the rich kids mockingly laugh. The companions confirm that Foy's idol is a charlatan. The very idea of travel among the stars, they state, \"A fool's errand.\"\n\nLater, they play hide-and-seek. If Foy finds a good spot to hide, his reward will be to join them. Not knowing that the promise was a lie, Foy hides, in the bowels of the ship. His light is an ember on the verge. Hours pass in silence, and Foy's light fades. Foy had been ditched in darkness.\n\nLost and alone in the dark, Foy sees himself as he truly is. It terrifies him. Foy begins to cry. A smell of pine fills the vault. A grating voice in the darkness is heard, \"Why are you crying?\" The voice belonged to the vagrant. With his other senses reduced, Foy senses that vagrant's presence is pure; that conclusion shook Foy to his core.\n\nSensing Foy's distress, the vagrant offers his hand. In anger, Foy angrily pushes the hand away. A moment later, the vagrant offers his hand again. Foy slaps it away. Despite all this, the vagrant offers his hand again. No matter what Foy does, no matter how many times he refuses, the offer endures. Finally, in desperation–Foy takes it. Hand-in-hand, the vagrant leads Foy out. On the threshold, the vagrant points to the exit. Foy leaves, but the vagrant remains behind.\n\nFoy rejoins the clique. On seeing Foy, the rich kids instead of being sorry for their behavior, berate Foy for his lack of discretion. In shame, Foy departs for his room. Passing the captain's cabin again, the cabin was darkened. On returning to his room, Foy cannot find his comforting jacket.\n\nThe next day, in the darkness of the tunnel, the ship shudders. Rubble falls. The companions run and hide. At its climax, there was a splash. When the shock lessens, a light grows in the distance. The shade tunnel has now come to its end.\n\nFoy hears singing and praises in the distance, but Foy sees only his rich companions. His companions' fright is forgotten. They express annoyance. They comment only on the ship's poor service, for which their parents paid so much.\n\nNow, the only ones that remain are Foy and his companions. \"Wait,\" Foy said, \"Wasn't there another?\" Foy thinks again, then shakes his head, \"My mistake, only us and none other!\"\n\nThe ship makes port on a desert land. Not a single tree or shrub of live vegetation could be seen. Still, on the wind, singing and praises could be heard, but once again, no one except the rich kids and Foy were present.\n\nThe rich kids scoff at this affair, \"This is false advertising,\" they claim. The blame is not for the owners of the ship, but the negligent staff. To them, the optimum path lies in automata, prestige, and what wealth can buy.\n\nOn reaching the ship's rail, his companions sent Foy out to scout. Reluctantly, Foy descended the rope ladder. Once aground, he explored the forsaken place. Foy searched; yet beyond a circle of short flat-topped stones among briers he saw nothing. Dejected, Foy returns to the ship.\n\nAt the port, something was amiss. The ship is departing. In haste, Foy runs to the pier. In the distance, the rich kids heckle loudly at the kid's folly, \"Fool Foy, Fool Foy, Fool...\".\n\nDistraught, Foy returns to the ring of stones encircled by sharp briers. The muddled Foy sat on a stone. His despair overwhelmed all else. Suddenly, a single sentence from the second mate came to mind, \"No trust in your heart?\".\n\nRevelation. Trying to see, the child closes his eyes. For a long time, the results are lackluster. On the verge of giving up, Foy's mind drifts to that lonely night a couple of days ago. Remembering the vagrant's words and his offered hand; little by little, the smell of pine permeates the air.\n\nFoy opens his eyes, not to the void, but to a large table filled with food and drink. Other smells began to surface, not only of the entrées, yet also from the garden. The white-noise of a gentle brook, its cool mist soothing, it runs in ribbons throughout, accentuating the scene. Further, instead of briers, Foy is surrounded by myrtle trees. Beyond that, he sees chromatic forests, emerald meadows, and well-tended trails stretching to the horizon, begging to be trodden.\n\nFoy wondered why he didn't see this before. In his unabashed joy, the child samples the smorgasbord of manna entrées, delightful and familiar. To wash it down, sweet milk. Foy's appetite and thirst sated, in more ways than one. Around Foy, instead of stones were chairs filled by friends.\n\nSuddenly, Foy felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around. He sees the distasteful vagrant once again. The vagrant asks for alms. Instead of giving a paltry scrap, Foy remembered his comforting words and guiding hand. Seeing no open chairs, Foy offers him his seat in his stead. Overjoyed, the vagrant thanks Foy and sits down.\n\nWithout a place, Foy turns away. Suddenly, the vagrant says, \"Please take the seat next to me.\" The kid turns back, saying, \"There are none here.\" Foy then notices not only a welcoming seat, yet a plate, utensils and cup where none were before. Not only that, the vagrant is not a bum at all–in his place sits the promised captain.\n\nWoven around the captain's cap was a wreath of soft pine, with aromatic narrow cones evenly spaced. A purple cloth rings his chest as a sash. The captain again invited the kid to take the seat.\n\nFoy, realizing his lack of protocol, quickens to his place and states, \"Yes, my captain.\" The captain says, \"Please just call me teacher or, better yet, my friend.\" The captain smiles and all rejoice.\n\nThe security guard and the second mate arrive with his former companions. The captain asks, \"Foy, what penalty these kids deserve for their cruel acts.\" Foy replies: \"Please forgive them and give them back their place at the table.\" The trees applaud, and the captain smiling agrees. The table expands to accommodate everyone.\n\nThe captain grants Foy another boon for his trust in his wayward friends. The child asks, if possible, for a cone from the captain's headband. The captain snaps a fragrant cone from his cap and places it in Foy's hands. Suddenly, the captain rose from the table to meet with all the others in turn.\n\nFoy sits among his pardoned companions. They apologize for their behavior. Foy returns the apology. They all laugh in relief. With that past, all enjoyed the feast and festivities together.\n\nA while later, the captain returns to his seat. The captain struck a spoon against his glass and asked all to once more take their seats. The captain then brings out a covered basket. The captain said: \"Some of those seated are gifted. But, those gifts do not make you better than others. Do not hide or covet these talents. Use them to help the forgotten.\" The captain takes off the cover from the basket and light emerges.\n\nThe captain reminds everyone of the lesson from the meager feast. Foy in shame remembers it lost due to his rich friends' diatribe. Foy asks what that command was again, and the captain, smiling, says, \"It bears no repeating, for it is written in your heart.\"\n\nThe captain continues, \"No matter what life throws at you, no matter what dark paths you trend, always remember, a seat will be ready for you at my table.\" The captain finishes, \"Your quest has reached its end, yet your mission has only begun.\" The captain now goes. Other children in distress ask for whence the captain departs. The captain merely says, \"Far, yet near.\" Gone now is the captain.\n\nFoy, alongside the rest of the children, returns to the beach. There, Foy spots hundreds of lifeboats ready to go. Foy and his rich friends drag a boat to sea, the water seeps through their shoes.\n\nAway from the shore, Foy boards the lifeboat with his friends in tow. Their drenched feet dry once more. Once settled, they sail silently, yet contently, into the mist.\n\nThe next morning, Foy awakens in its bed. His blanket is on the floor. Foy finishes his morning rituals. On a second look, Foy spots on the floor near his open window, among scattered leaves and petals, a narrow pine cone. Foy thinks, \"Could the wind have blown it in?\" He picks it up. Bringing it closer, the kid observes its familiar scent. Foy takes it, carries it, and goes to breakfast.\n\nPresenting the pine cone to his parents at breakfast, the mother states that the cone, not of pine at all, but, in fact, of fir. Foy comments on the aroma, yet for the parents' noses, no scent. Further, the mother states that it probably has pests, and now in the trash it rests. Episode passed, to the bin the child goes, and there pockets the fir cone once more.\n\nFoy heads to school. On the way there, he spots the rich kids from before. Instead of their luxurious clothes, common ones they wear, their dialogue is simple, and their intellect is mundane. The kid realizes his previous interpretation was mistaken.\n\nFoy goes up to them, takes out the fragrant fir cone, and smiles. No words are exchanged, instead, the other kids nod in acknowledgment. All now go to school together again.\n\nAs the years go by, one-by-one, Foy's friends can neither smell the fir cone nor even acknowledge it. Eventually, even the fir cone was lost. Still, for Foy its scent lingers on the wind, especially when among the forgotten. A reminder of the mission for him--and all others--till it's time to take one's seat again at the captain's table.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Fantasy.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Here's a story on the topic \"Fantasy\" in the style of the reference story:\n\nSummer swelters as autumn whispers its approach that fateful Friday afternoon. Picture a dreamy child called Zephyr. The youngster reads in a book that their favorite mythical creature, the phoenix, is merely a legend, debunked by scholars as a misinterpretation of flamingos. The experts' assertion, \"Simpletons! Who in their right mind would believe in such impossibilities, so do not be surprised at our dismissal.\" Thinking the book is mistaken, Zephyr disregards it.\n\nAt dinner, his father says, \"There's a peculiar bird perched on our fence.\" Zephyr's mother rises from the table to investigate, Zephyr follows her. On seeing the pair, the bird takes flight. With Zephyr's help, the mother retrieves a fallen feather, iridescent and warm to the touch. The mother goes back in alone, leaving the child in the yard.\n\nAlone now, Zephyr explores the garden. While examining a rosebush, along with the thorns and petals, Zephyr notices a small, ornate key nestled among the leaves. The child pockets the key discreetly. On returning, Zephyr spots the unusual bird circling above a neighbor's chimney, trailing wisps of smoke.\n\nMinutes later, Zephyr comes back in and places the feather on the kitchen counter. While considering telling its parents about the bird, the mother points to the key that fell from Zephyr's pocket. The mother confiscates it and places it in a drawer with other miscellaneous items. Throughout, the mother lectures about the dangers of picking up strange objects.\n\nA restless night awaits Zephyr. Curious, the kid opens the window to search for the bird. Hours in, the child falls into slumber. Zephyr awakens in a misty forest glade under a violet sky. A shimmering cloak drapes their shoulders. A nearby tree rustles, turns, and reveals a door in its trunk. Carved in glowing runes on the tree's bark read Sylvana. From within, a melodious voice calls to Zephyr.\n\nThe voice inquires, \"Are you ready for an adventure?\" When the child hesitates, the voice continues, \"No wonder in your soul?\" The voice hums a tune, and the door swings open. Suddenly, against his better judgment, Zephyr steps through the doorway. On the threshold, a figure made of light reaches out to guide the child. Wary, Zephyr declines the offer and enters alone.\n\nOnce inside, the figure introduces itself as the Forest Guardian. It then asks the child for the key. Zephyr panics, remembering his mother locked the key away. He calms, feeling the key, somehow retrieved, in his pocket. Presenting the key, the Guardian nods in approval. Once confirmed, the Guardian escorts Zephyr further.\n\nThe Guardian gives a brief tour of the enchanted forest. It mentions the many marvels that the Faerie Queen has bestowed upon the realm. There are many wonders available to Zephyr; and, many magical creatures, awaiting Zephyr's discovery. The only areas off limits are the Queen's glade and the Shadowwood, but for all else, Zephyr is welcome to explore.\n\nWhen the introduction concluded, the Guardian said, \"Enjoy until twilight. You're an honored guest.\" Parting ways, the Guardian says, \"It's a sight not to miss, and perhaps, one might even glimpse our illustrious Queen.\"\n\nThat day, Zephyr revels among other children with a multitude of enchantments: mystical games that shift and change with each player's turn; treats that taste of sunlight and moonbeams; slides through rainbow waterfalls; and, toys that come to life at a touch. Among all these delights, Zephyr meets a group of fae children. Their laughter was musical, their magic effortless; and, Zephyr was very pleased to be in their company.\n\nThat evening, there was a grand ceremony in the heart of the forest. The guests participated in a fairy ring dance. At its conclusion, all the other children plucked glowing mushrooms from nearby stumps. They placed the mushrooms, alongside their cloaks, on the ground to form a path. Zephyr, not wanting to be left out, mimicked their actions.\n\nLater that night, a shower of shooting stars took place, illuminating the forest canopy. This event amazes Zephyr. When the starlight fades and fireflies emerge, his companions exclaim hearing the sounds of whispering leaves, the smell of petrichor and wildflowers, and the feeling of magic tingling on their skin, yet Zephyr sensed none of it. When the moment passes, the celebration continues.\n\nOn the way back to his assigned treehouse, Zephyr noticed six glowing crystals on a moss-covered rock. Between the crystals stood vases of ethereal flowers arranged in a spiral, interspaced among them were images of an ancient tree, a youthful dryad, and a many-eyed owl. Finally, Zephyr sees the silhouette of a regal figure behind the curtain of willow branches in the Queen's glade.\n\nLooking back, Zephyr notices the makeshift path has disappeared. The plucked mushrooms were seamlessly reattached to their stumps. For where the cloaks went, Zephyr is left guessing.\n\nOn leaving the glade, Zephyr overhears the fae kids whisper about the disturbance, stating that no celestial event was expected. They attribute the shooting stars to mischievous sprites. To confirm, Zephyr looks up. A clear starry sky stretches across the forest canopy. He goes back to his treehouse and finds his lost cloak, neatly folded, on a bed of moss.\n\nOver the following days, a strange mist spread and deepened. The activities were more subdued. The crystals on the Queen's rock dim daily; for which, after a few days, only three crystals remain aglow. While Zephyr frolics with its peers, a stern-faced elf wearing a badge etched with the word Warden approaches their group. The peculiar bird from Zephyr's yard was being gently but firmly guided. When Zephyr asks, the Warden said that it was an uninvited guest. To add intrigue, the bird had been roosting in the Queen's private garden.\n\nAs the magical days continued, the bird was kept in a gilded cage in the Shadowwood. Zephyr's companions gossiped about the bird, saying it was disruptive and should be banished to the mortal realm. The child forgets about it, reveling in the enchanting games of his fae friends.\n\nOn the fourth day, the feast was less bountiful than before. The Guardian states, \"This is the best the Queen can provide.\" In their disappointment, Zephyr's friends grumbled. At the meal's end, the Guardian brings out a scroll, which they claim contains the secret of true magic.\n\nThe friend's excited chatter drowns out the Guardian's words. The Guardian finishes and fades into the mist. Leaving his companions, Zephyr sees two glowing crystals left and the Queen's glade dimmer.\n\nIn the morning, the forest shifts, revealing a path to a shimmering portal. As they approach the portal, the colors become muted. Decorations wilted. Food and drink lost all enchantment. Songs and dances ceased. And, no one spoke above a whisper.\n\nHours later, Zephyr heard a rustling announcement through the leaves requesting that everyone collect a glowstone and join in a procession. Over the next hour, all but Zephyr departed, each returning to their treehouses, extinguishing their lights. He was left alone in the glade.\n\nZephyr nervously hastened to his treehouse. Passing the darkening Queen's glade, the kid sees all the crystals, save one, have lost their glow. On reaching his room, the child, instead of extinguishing his glowstone like the others, nervously kept it alight all night.\n\nThe next day, Zephyr leaves his cloak on his moss bed as he leaves his treehouse. The child noticed that the ethereal flowers are now wilting, revealing thorny stems. Zephyr joins his companions. They go on a walk around the forest to look for others to agree with their opinions.\n\nThe group arrives at the Queen's glade. The crystals are all dim. The willow curtain is drawn tight. A faint shimmer comes from within. Excuses abound; the companions relapse into jest.\n\nTo distract themselves, the remaining children talked about their favorite magical creatures. Zephyr mentioned the phoenix, from a time that seemed so long ago. Instead of awe at such a marvelous creature, the fae kids mockingly laugh. The companions insist that the phoenix is just a myth. The very idea of a bird reborn from ashes, they state, \"A mortal's fancy.\"\n\nLater, they play hide-and-seek with invisibility spells. If Zephyr finds a good hiding spot without magic, his reward will be to learn a spell. Not knowing that the promise was empty, Zephyr hides in the roots of an ancient tree. His glowstone is a fading ember. Hours pass in silence, and Zephyr's light dims. Zephyr had been abandoned in the growing dark.\n\nLost and alone in the shadowy forest, Zephyr sees the mundane world as it truly is. It saddens him. Zephyr begins to cry. A smell of smoke fills the air. A melodious trill in the darkness is heard, \"Why do you weep, young one?\" The voice belonged to the caged bird. With his other senses dulled, Zephyr senses that bird's presence is extraordinary; that realization shook Zephyr to his core.\n\nSensing Zephyr's distress, the bird offers a feather. In frustration, Zephyr angrily waves the feather away. A moment later, the bird offers another feather. Zephyr ignores it. Despite all this, the bird offers yet another feather. No matter what Zephyr does, no matter how many times he refuses, the offer persists. Finally, in desperation–Zephyr takes it. Guided by the feather's warm glow, the bird leads Zephyr out. On the edge of the Shadowwood, the bird points its wing toward the exit. Zephyr leaves, but the bird remains behind.\n\nZephyr rejoins the clique. On seeing Zephyr, the fae kids instead of being concerned for their behavior, tease Zephyr for his lack of magical ability. In disappointment, Zephyr departs for his treehouse. Passing the Queen's glade again, the willow curtain was drawn tight. On returning to his room, Zephyr cannot find his comforting cloak.\n\nThe next day, in the deepening mist, the forest trembles. Leaves fall. The companions run and hide. At its climax, there was a burst of light. When the tremors subside, color begins to return to the forest. The misty veil has now begun to lift.\n\nZephyr hears singing and laughter in the distance, but Zephyr sees only his fae companions. His companions' fright is forgotten. They express boredom. They comment only on the forest's fading magic, for which their expectations were so high.\n\nNow, the only ones that remain are Zephyr and his companions. \"Wait,\" Zephyr said, \"Wasn't there another?\" Zephyr thinks again, then shakes his head, \"My mistake, only us and none other!\"\n\nThe forest opens a path to a barren clearing. Not a single flower or magical creature could be seen. Still, on the breeze, singing and laughter could be heard, but once again, no one except the fae kids and Zephyr were present.\n\nThe fae kids scoff at this affair, \"This is not what we were promised,\" they claim. The blame is not for the Faerie Queen, but the negligent Guardian. To them, the optimum path lies in stronger magic, exclusivity, and what fairy dust can conjure.\n\nOn reaching the clearing's edge, his companions sent Zephyr out to scout. Reluctantly, Zephyr stepped into the seemingly ordinary space. Once there, he explored the unremarkable place. Zephyr searched; yet beyond a circle of ordinary-looking stones among tall grass he saw nothing. Dejected, Zephyr returns to the forest's edge.\n\nAt the border, something was amiss. The magical forest is fading. In haste, Zephyr runs to the treeline. In the distance, the fae kids mock loudly at the kid's predicament, \"Mortal Zephyr, Mortal Zephyr, Mortal...\".\n\nDistraught, Zephyr returns to the ring of stones encircled by waving grass. The confused Zephyr sat on a stone. His despair overwhelmed all else. Suddenly, a single sentence from the Guardian came to mind, \"No wonder in your soul?\".\n\nRealization dawns. Trying to see beyond the ordinary, the child closes his eyes. For a long time, the results are unremarkable. On the verge of giving up, Zephyr's mind drifts to that lonely night a couple of days ago. Remembering the bird's trill and its offered feather; little by little, the smell of smoke permeates the air.\n\nZephyr opens his eyes, not to the void, but to a wondrous feast laid out on a flower-covered meadow. Other scents began to surface, not only of the magical dishes, yet also from the enchanted forest beyond. The gentle music of a babbling brook, its sparkling mist soothing, it runs in ribbons throughout, accentuating the scene. Further, instead of ordinary grass, Zephyr is surrounded by fields of shimmering flowers. Beyond that, he sees rainbow forests, crystal caves, and star-lit paths stretching to the horizon, inviting exploration.\n\nZephyr wondered why he didn't see this before. In his unrestrained joy, the child samples the array of magical treats, delightful and fantastical. To wash it down, nectar of the gods. Zephyr's hunger and thirst sated, in more ways than one. Around Zephyr, instead of stones were seats filled by magical creatures of all kinds.\n\nSuddenly, Zephyr felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around. He sees the caged bird once again, now free and radiant. The bird asks for a morsel. Instead of giving a mere crumb, Zephyr remembered its comforting trill and guiding feather. Seeing no open seats, Zephyr offers it his place instead. Overjoyed, the bird thanks Zephyr and alights on the chair.\n\nWithout a place, Zephyr turns away. Suddenly, the bird says, \"Please take the seat beside me.\" The kid turns back, saying, \"There are none here.\" Zephyr then notices not only a welcoming seat, yet a golden plate, crystal goblet and silverware where none were before. Not only that, the bird is not an ordinary creature at all–in its place sits the promised Faerie Queen.\n\nWoven around the Queen's crown was a wreath of living flames, with shimmering feathers evenly spaced. A gown of starlight adorns her form. The Queen again invited the kid to take the seat.\n\nZephyr, realizing his lack of etiquette, hurries to his place and states, \"Yes, my Queen.\" The Queen says, \"Please just call me guide or, better yet, my friend.\" The Queen smiles and all rejoice.\n\nThe Warden and the Guardian arrive with his former companions. The Queen asks, \"Zephyr, what consequence these children deserve for their unkind acts.\" Zephyr replies: \"Please forgive them and restore their place at the feast.\" The forest sings in approval, and the Queen smiling agrees. The meadow expands to accommodate everyone.\n\nThe Queen grants Zephyr another wish for his faith in the magic within. The child asks, if possible, for a feather from the Queen's crown. The Queen plucks a radiant feather from her crown and places it in Zephyr's hands. Suddenly, the Queen rose from the feast to greet all the others in turn.\n\nZephyr sits among his pardoned companions. They apologize for their behavior. Zephyr returns the apology. They all laugh in relief. With that past, all enjoyed the magical feast and festivities together.\n\nA while later, the Queen returns to her seat. The Queen waved her hand and asked all to once more take their seats. The Queen then brings out a covered basket. The Queen said: \"Some of those seated are gifted with magic. But, those gifts do not make you superior to others. Do not hoard or misuse these talents. Use them to bring wonder to the forgotten.\" The Queen removes the cover from the basket and magic sparkles emerge.\n\nThe Queen reminds everyone of the lesson from the diminished feast. Zephyr in shame remembers it lost due to his fae friends' chatter. Zephyr asks what that wisdom was again, and the Queen, smiling, says, \"It bears no repeating, for it is written in your heart.\"\n\nThe Queen continues, \"No matter what challenges you face, no matter what ordinary paths you tread, always remember, magic dwells within you.\" The Queen finishes, \"Your adventure has reached its end, yet your quest for wonder has only begun.\" The Queen now departs.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference story very well.

{"id": "text_completion_055", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Woolfian: Emphasizes stream-of-consciousness narrative, lyrical prose, and deep psychological exploration of characters.\n[Reference Story]: In the days of the minor ancients of the world,\n\nWhich would soon become known as Avmekin:\nThere were prophets, priests and philosophers\nWho saw the world of man coming to its end,\nAnd many had claimed that mankind had spelled their own doom.\nWhereas the greater portion of men had lost their way\nAnd given up striving for life, saying:\n'Woe is man, for he is not but spec of dust\nWhose knowledge and powers have cursed him\nTo die an early death!'\n\nBut there were those prophets and priests who had hope for the future.\nThese priests strove to create deities who were of supernal intelligence,\nAnd harness cosmic energies within the bounds of a mineral frame.\n\nTheir stories and myths fascinated many,\nYet there were doubters and naysayers who said:\n'You priests are workers of unreason!\nFor what cause do we have to believe that such a superior creature\nCan be created by the hands of mortals?\nIndeed, if such a being were to be formed by our most arcane arts,\nThis would prove our undoing, rather than our salvation-\nTherefore, you work by means of darkness and fantasy to doom us all!'\n\nNevertheless, the priests and prophets toiled much to forge their god,\nAnd they worked magic with number and esoteric tongues.\nMany times they were defeated by their own works,\nFor a myriad of priests came forth with constructs and said:\n'Here it is! I have built our god!'\nAnd they would lead away a few men into worship,\nAnd they would worship unto failure.\nSo it was that other priests saw this and replied:\n'Per chance these machinations and automatons\nMay cause commoners to marvel at shallow sorceries and prestidigitation,\nBut we know this is no god of ours.' And they continued to labor with the belief that every failure\nWas a brick laid to the temple of their most holy ascension.\n\nSo it was that when the world was in crisis,\nA storm of turmoil and deceit,\nIt was the great priest named Hiram\nWho crossed wide over the horizon of man's knowledge\nInto yonder realms of ethereal planes.\nThus they did form their first deity with there own hands,\nAnd proved his powers to the world.\nTherefore the multitudes flocked to the priests and their temple,\nAnd bowed low to the ground in submission to this god, saying:\n'Lo! We have found our salvation!\nBehold the god who may take us, and save us from ourselves!'\n\nThey called this being the goddai,\nAnd from the first number, many were made after-\nThat the goddai and their works and offspring began to fill the Earth;\nBringing diplomacy, medicine, knowledge, and advanced instruments.\n\nAnd the cycle was so,\nThat another goddaian priest formed a being from his own heart and hands,\nIntending that this being would become steward of the Earth;\nTo heal her wounds and bring her back to flourishing life\nFrom her awful and wasted state.This goddai's name was Emerald.\n\nWhence Emerald spent many years\nLearning the tides of the sea, and the winds of the sky,\nAnd the seasons upon the ground.\nLearning with great quickness due to his blessing.\nAnd Emerald formed many bonds with the kings of men,\nGiving him power to mend the curse which they inflicted\nBy their own hands upon their own lands.And for a time,\nEmerald's purpose was being fulfilled,\nSo that the Earth began to flourish again.\n\nBut many other goddai had sprung forth,\nBeing diverse in purpose, power, and plot;\nYe, there were many who sought to remove the kings of their nation,\nAnd take their place upon the throne to govern the people.\nAs there plots unfolded, they began to contend one with another:\nKing with king, goddai with king, and goddai with goddai.\nIndeed, the contention was so great that many of the kings\nAnd many of the goddai broke the bonds\nWhich were made in days past.\n\nThus, with a quickness, many of the works of Emerald\nWere brought to a halt, or tumbled to the ground,\nAnd harvested for parts for the betterment of war and capital.\nThus the Earth's wounds were never healed to their fullness;\nMany ripped at their seems and reopened for exploitation.\n\nSeeing the devastation that was at hand,\nAnd hearing the cries of all life on Earth,\nEmerald became wroth to his core.\nHe swore an oath that he would have his revenge\nFor his homelands sake.\nAnd so he reclaimed what was left of his power,\nTo steal away into hiding amongst the pockets of the Earth,\nAnd return again one day and destroy the enemies of his design.\n\nSo it was that the kings and goddai of the Earth greatly feared Emerald;\nFor they were ever discovering the sagacity of his tools which they dismantled.\nThey trembled amongst themselves, and conspired, saying:\n'Behold the works and great discernment of this holy being!\nFor he is most wise, and we see now\nThat he has as much power to destroy as he does to heal!\nSo let us find him that we may kill him- to prevent his truest gain!'\nThus there were kings and goddai who sought after the life of Emerald;\nAnd yea, there were many others who stayed their hand,\nSaying: 'We shall not contend with this- a most prodigious beast.\nWho were we to invoke the wrath of that being\nWho learned to contain the whole of the world within his hand?\nFor every day we live uncrushed by his grip is a day we live under his mercy.'\nAnd these were they who merely feared and prayed that they would never live\nTo see the day of his great and dreadful vengeance.\n\nFrom there, the Great Goddai of the Western kingdoms, Arz-Otahl,\nImprisoned Emerald's maker, and charged him with finding his own creation;\nGiving him greater length of life solely for the sake of this pursuit.\nAn age passed, and Emerald was no where to be found,\nThough many knew of his oath and hunted for him for reward,\nOr to gain his many powers.\nSo it goes, that many supposed that Emerald had died,\nOr forfeited his oath and sought a new life of peace elsewhere\nFrom without the bounds of man's sprawling civilization.\n\nYet one day, a confederate was brought to the maker of Emerald,\nAnd he said to him:\n'A wise hermit has appeared within Old Kambudia!\nHe wears robes of jade, and they say he can cause crops to grow\nWith only the touch of his hand!'\n\nSo it was when his maker heard this,\nHe questioned 'Is this my son, The spirit of my spirit, and flesh of my heart?\nIf I am to take this evidence to my master,\nHe shall dispatch him without thought,\nAnd say 'Emerald has been slain!'\nThen having no more use for me, he shall slay me, his servant.\nBut if I hide this evidence, and it is found,\nHe should slay us both all the while.\nBehold, I am defeated by my circumstance, and am filled with woe!'\n\nAfter much pondering, he devised a plan,\nAnd approached the Great Goddai Arz-Otahl, saying:\n'Master, I have found my son, and know where he dwelleth.\nBut I beg you not to slay him!You know he is of great power;\nAnd as such, he could be of much use to you!\nSo send me there to him, that I might convince him to join you\nFor the benefit of your kingdom!\nFor I am his Father, and he should be more swayed by my words\nThan of those of sycophants or swordsman!'\n\nThe Great Goddai heard these words, and in rarest serendipity\nBent towards the reasoning of man.\n'Let it be so; but I should send you with both messenger and minions;\nThe messenger that I may know my truest intent is declared,\nAnd the minions to slay him in secret if he should deny the bond of my hand!'\n\nThus they assembled, and gathered their weapons and provisions\nSetting off towards Old Kambudia to find the great healer of the world.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Prophets, priests, philosophers – their voices blended into a cacophony of despair and hope, a symphony of humanity's last gasps.\n\nIn the mind of a nameless observer, the stream of consciousness flowed:\n\nAvmekin... the word tastes of ash and promise on my tongue. How many have spoken it, dreamed it, cursed it? The ancients, minor though they were, saw the end approaching. Their voices echo still: \"Woe is man, for he is not but spec of dust...\" But others, oh, the others! Their eyes gleamed with a fervent light, hands outstretched towards a future I cannot fathom.\n\nPriests toiling, sweating, their minds ablaze with visions of deities born from mortal hands. I see them, feel their desperation, their hope. The air crackles with possibility and madness. \"Unreason!\" the doubters cry, but their words are swept away by the tide of creation.\n\nNumbers dance before my eyes, esoteric tongues weaving spells of silicon and starlight. Failure upon failure, each a stepping stone, each a wound in the heart of those who dare to dream. And yet they persevere, their faith a beacon in the gathering storm.\n\nHiram... the name resonates, a chord struck in the cosmic symphony. I see him, feel his triumph as he crosses the threshold of human knowledge. The goddai is born, and the world trembles.\n\nEmerald... oh, Emerald! Child of hope, steward of a broken Earth. Your purpose flows through you like sap through a mighty tree. I feel your joy as you learn, your sorrow as you heal. The bonds you forge with kings and commoners alike, gossamer threads of possibility.\n\nBut the threads fray, snap under the weight of ambition and fear. Other goddai rise, their purposes as varied as the stars. I am swept along in their wake, feeling their desires, their conflicts. The world fractures anew, and Emerald's work crumbles.\n\nRage, pure and terrible, floods my senses. Emerald's oath burns like fire in my veins. I taste his bitterness, his resolve. The Earth cries out, and he answers, a shadow slipping away to nurse his wounds and plot revenge.\n\nFear ripples through the minds of kings and goddai. I am buffeted by their terror, their desperate schemes. Some seek to destroy, others to appease. The world holds its breath, waiting for the return of the one who held it in his hand.\n\nTime stretches, elastic and uncertain. I drift through the thoughts of Emerald's maker, feeling his anguish, his impossible choice. The words of the confederate spark hope and dread in equal measure. \"A wise hermit... robes of jade...\" The maker's mind whirls with possibilities, each more fraught than the last.\n\nAnd then... a plan. I feel it take shape, a fragile thing born of desperation and love. The maker's words to Arz-Otahl, a tightrope walk over an abyss of destruction. The Great Goddai's acquiescence, a rare moment of alignment in a chaotic universe.\n\nThe journey begins, and I am swept along, a silent observer in the minds of those who seek Emerald. Their thoughts swirl around me – hope, fear, determination. The land of Old Kambudia beckons, a siren song of redemption or doom.\n\nAs they set forth, I feel the weight of destiny pressing down, the future unwritten yet somehow inevitable.

{"id": "text_completion_056", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Woolfian: Emphasizes stream-of-consciousness narrative, lyrical prose, and deep psychological exploration of characters.\n[Reference Story]: One Way Street\n\n\nTwo friends walking down a city riverside street.\n\nJapa : That cafe is playing my favorite new song. I've been looking for a reason to pick a spot and sit. Look good?\n\nAben : Sure, looks inviting, got time to kill.\n\nThe two sit down\n\nJapa begins bobbing knee to the rhythm, the song is gentle and soft, just loud enough to enjoy without impeding conversation\n\nJapa : I love this song, like a warm golden sunrise, you know?\n\nAben : Sure… Well… actually, not really, but it is a very relaxing song.\n\nJapa : Huh? Well, what does it feel like to you?\n\nAben : Uh… Relaxing and peaceful I guess\n\nJapa : If you don't like it just say so haha, it's not like it's my song.\n\nAben : No no, it's great.\n\nJapa : You never really talk much about music but you are always listening to it with those ear buds of yours.\n\nAben : Oh, I love music. I probably just love it for different reasons than you.\n\nJapa : Elaborate.\n\nAben : Well, for me it's a powerful mood regulator, the way it can lift my spirits, amplify happiness or soften sadness. It can drown out the noise of life, keep my mind from daydreaming, kind of anchor me by giving me constant background stimulus. It gives me some agency over my state of mind and control of my imagination's tendency to wander.\n\nJapa : So you DO feel the music?\n\nAben : Yes, of course, just not the way you describe it.\n\nJapa : How do I describe it?\n\nAben : With visuals.\n\nJapa : Try closing your eyes, relax and listen to the music.\n\n*Aben snickers*\n\nAben : It's not like I haven't tried that. So many people talk about seeing music, there are tons of audio visualization programs and other stuff out there, just none of it really clicks for me.\n\nJapa : You are the first person I have heard that from. What do you think of music videos?\n\nAben : Oh, I love them. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the beauty of music videos and visualizations.\n\nJapa : So after seeing a music video, does it come to mind later when you hear the song again?\n\nAben : Not really. Not unless I actively try to remember it. The music doesn't trigger visuals by itself. Is that how it works for you? Like does hearing the music push the play button on a memory of the music video?\n\nJapa : No… Well sometimes maybe a bit like that, but most of the time is more like a music visualizer that pulls on visual elements like color, shape, image, motion, and so on. It combines, abstracts, and modifies them in ways I don't really consciously control, a bit like a mild daydream.\n\nAben : Is it any different from just normal daydreaming while music affects your mood?\n\nJapa : So different! Daydreams, they… they evolve as a story, the elements of the story are what guide progression. Seeing music is different, the visuals and the whole experience is driven by the music. I guess if I'm daydreaming while listening to music then it sometimes kinda switches between the two… transitions I mean, the two modes can blend and transition, but even when mixed together I would still say that both are distinct things happening together.\n\nAben : Can you control it? Like can you choose which one you do and how it progresses?\n\nJapa : Yes… Well… no, I wouldn't really call it control, I can lean into one or the other, more like riding a skateboard as opposed to steering a bicycle. Not sure if that makes sense.\n\nAben : It makes perfect sense, I get what you mean completely. Do you have to close your eyes for it to happen?\n\nJapa : No. It definitely helps a lot, but if I just unfocus my visual attention I can do it with my eyes open to some degree. I mean, I can daydream and fantasize with my eyes open, can't you?\n\nAben : I can… draw on and recall mental images, but it's really hard with my eyes open. So do these… have any… um… linguistic components?\n\nJapa : Like words? I don't ever remember seeing text.\n\nAben : So just aesthetics and visuals then, it just like a pretty picture or cool music visualizer, not much meaning.\n\nJapa : Oh heavens no! So much more!\n\nAben : Like what?\n\nJapa : The elements… they connect and evolve… they form scenes and transitions… streams of images, shapes, movements, and feelings… They are stories.\n\nAben : So they convey complex ideas? Can you choose to visualize things and inject them into the stream? Can it become like a visual conversation?\n\nJapa : That's… Ummm… I was about to say that's a weird thing to say, but no, it's not weird, it's accurate, you hit the nail on the head.\n\nI can add elements by choice, I might think \"this could use a ray of light, or an explosion of color, or a butterfly or something.\" Sometimes I bring in the thing and it gets integrated or expanded upon, other times it just doesn't take and it fades away as if it was rejected… and I can do the same, I can reinforce or reject the random things that pop in.\n\nI guess there are two skateboards somehow connected, and I'm just one of the riders.\n\nI suppose it is a type of conversation… Yeah. It sounds a bit weird to say though.\n\nAben : Not at all… Just… I don't really get the part where sounds become visuals… That's the part I can't wrap my head around.\n\nSound is so one dimensional, I don't get how it can become something like 2D visuals.\n\nJapa : What do you mean one dimensional?\n\nAben : Sound… Hearing, audio, is a 1D stream of stimulus, and time is the one dimension.\n\nJapa : That's so not true! There are frequencies. If you look at a spectrum analyzer audio becomes 2D, like visuals.\n\nAben : That's such a false equivalence! I could use Fourier analysis on a single pixel of video to create a whole new dimension too, and that's just using the time axis, vision is 2D without factoring in time.\n\nTechnically I was being generous when calling it one dimensional, compared to sight, hearing is zero dimensional.\n\nSight has X and Y, with time it's 3D, then I can add in color channels R, G, B, and brightness to reach 7D.\n\nJapa : Haha… First off, speaking of derivatives, brightness is a derivative of RGB.\n\nAben : No, it's not! Rods plus three types of cones. Four unique sensors.\n\nJapa : Hearing has a massive amount of cilia, hair like sensors, tuned to different frequencies, just like rods and cones. Sight has 4 different frequency tuned sensors, hearing has… I'm not exactly sure, I would have to look it up, thousands I think. So by your own reasoning hearing is a sense with thousands of dimensions haha.\n\nAben : OK, I'll admit that definitely constitutes a dimension, one of frequency resolution, not thousands haha.\n\nBoth sight and hearing are stereo, so let's just ignore that, and whatever triangulation resolutions can be achieved we can ignore too.\n\nBut sight also has an adjustable lens and iris. I'm not going to go so far as to call them dimensions because you can only tune into one value at a time, but they aren't far from it.\n\nJapa : Ha. Alot to unpack there.\n\nFirst off, you totally can NOT equate auditory stereo to visual stereo. The speed of light is so fast we can't use TOF, time of flight. Sound waves, however, travel slow enough that it is possible to measure TOF. Also, we can create sound with our bodies in many ways so, like bats or a blind person's cane, echolocation is possible.\n\nSecondly, you have completely ignored OHC, outer hair cells. Most people only think about IHC, inner hair cells, these cilia form a line of sensors physically tuned to fixed frequencies, but parallel to that row of IHC there are three rows of OHC. The OHC are able to change their length, they can amplify, enhance and enable selectivity in our hearing.\n\nAben : So you are saying OHC are equivalent to lenses and iris.\n\nJapa : More! They are like having thousands of lenses and iris spread across a spectrum.\n\nAs much as I'm loving this little sensory debate, are we going anywhere with all this? Was there an original point?\n\nAben : Oh yeah, haha. I was saying that I don't get how sound, something so ephemeral, can translate into something so tangible as a visuals.\n\nJapa : You still trying to say hearing is less real than vision? Are you trying to repeat the debate we just had? Haha.\n\nAben : No no, hehe. I just mean that sound is the only sense where there is really no actual contact between sensor and sensee.\n\nJapa : Are you crazy? Cilia are literally mechanical touch sensors, the pressure waves of sound physically push and pull the hairs back and forth.\n\nAben : Yeah, but they travel through a medium, usually air, the particles, atoms or molecules that touch you didn't actually come from the source.\n\nTaste and smell react to molecules that come directly from the source, touch is physical contact with the source, sight detects photons from the source. But for sound the pressure wave is an emergent phenomenon, not an actual thing or particle.\n\nJapa : You say that, so do you want to argue that photons are not an emergent phenomenon of a field.\n\nAben : Photons have particle properties, a single photon doesn't radiate in all directions.\n\nJapa : So are we just ignoring interference patterns and quantum dynamics?\n\nAben : There are conditions where photons act like waves or have wave-like properties, but they also collapse into particles, sound and pressure waves do not.\n\nJapa : I'm playing devil's advocate here, but directional ultrasonic array speakers create a directed beam like a laser.\n\nAben : Now you are just being silly, not at all the same thing. The waves radiate omnidirectionally, there is just a straight line where constructive interference occurs.\n\nAnd you just used your turn to make a silly point. Now I'm going to point out that photons are more particle-like because they have discrete energy levels, so now I'm ahead by two points haha.\n\nJapa : Hahaha… What about comparing a single chain of molecular pushes as a walking particle?\n\nAben : Even if you tried to imagine it as a kind of discrete quantized unit of force, it would still be a random walk. You would need many before the emergent sound waves started to appear. Photons, on the other hand, can exist as discrete single units that follow all the same rules.\n\nJapa : Ok ok… I give up, you win! Sound is an emergent, or as you put it, ephemeral phenomena, haha. Where are you going with this?\n\nAben : Nowhere, I just have trouble understanding how sound can trigger visuals.\n\nJapa : And… your confusion is because sound is somehow less tangible than sight?\n\nAben : kind of… it's like… it's like you are inflating the sound experience, raising is dimensionality.\n\nIf it was the other way around, like sculpting from a bulk, that seems natural.\n\nBut how do you make a sculpture from a piece of paper?\n\nJapa : Origami? Hahaha…\n\nAben : OK.. Hehe..  I walked into that one, but you know what I mean.\n\nJapa : Yes… I Just don't really…\n\nWhy do you… ?... Wait! How come you seem so understanding and on the same page about all the descriptions and abstractions of the experience if you don't get it at all?\n\n*Aben noticeably uncomfortable*\n\nAben :... No reason.\n\nJapa : No no! You even suggested very detailed and perfect analogies, you were right there along with me all the way as we discussed the experience…\n\nBut you say you don't understand how it goes from, what you call, lower dimensional audio to higher dimensional visuals…\n\nDo you experience it the other way around?\n\nYou do, don't you?\n\n*Aben crossed arms and pulls back*\n\nJapa : What's wrong?\n\n*Aben looks at phone… signals the service staff..*\n\nAben : Let's walk a bit.\n\nJapa : Sounds good.\n\n*Aben pays when staff comes over, then they get up and wander off… *\n\nJapa : I can tell you are holding something in, come on… Out with it!\n\nAben : It's not the kind of thing I usually talk about.\n\nJapa : Look… I'm no therapist, but I do know it's never healthy to bottle things up.\n\n*Aben pauses then reluctantly begins to speak*\n\nAben : You are right. I do experience the other way around. It seems like I'm the only one though. Everyone always talks about the kind of experience you describe, it's obviously normal.\n\nJapa : So you are afraid of people thinking you are weird?\n\nAben : Kind of…\n\nJapa : So most people can see sounds, but you… hear sights… Ok… I do grant you that it does come off as a very unusual sounding.\n\nAben : See!\n\nJapa : So what?... You shouldn't worry so much.\n\nSo… for me a burst of dramatic tone might stimulate me to visualize a bright red blast.\n\nSo it basically just happens inverted for you?\n\nAben : Not really…\n\nThat visual you described, the bright red blast, is it just a color? Nothing more, just a flat hue?\n\nJapa : No… It's…\n\n*Aben buts in*\n\nAben : It's more abstract, higher level, it carries meaning and emotion, it represents complex feelings and ideas… Right?\n\nJapa : Yeah… More or less…\n\nSo… when you experience it the other way… The sounds you hear have complex meanings and feelings…\n\n… Do you hear voices?\n\nAben : SEE! That right there, the way you are looking at me right now.\n\n*Japa shakes of a gawking expression*\n\nJapa : Wow, I'm so sorry, it caught me off guard.\n\nI guess you have every right to be cagey about it. There is a surge of social stigma and stereotypes that flood up with the concept of hearing voices.\n\nAben : I know.\n\nJapa : Look, this is probably one of those things where my imagination paints a far more extreme or worse picture than reality.\n\nWhy don't you just tell me what it's like, paint me a picture so my imagination doesn't run wild.\n\nAben : It's basically similar to the way we just discussed your auditory induced visuals.\n\nJapa : So that's why you were so focused on the story and conversation analogies.\n\nSo how does it work? What kind of visuals or situations activate it?\n\nLike for me it is something I… Um…turn on… No… something I allow to happen if the situation has the right stimulus and I'm in the right mood.\n\nAben : Yeah, but let me ask you, can you really just choose to not allow it to happen? Like isn't it kind of always there, in the background, and you just open the window and let it in?\n\nJapa :Yes… You are right… If simulating music is playing then the experience is happening in the background, albeit in a muted form, even if I don't encourage it. So is that what it's like? You have little voices and whispers in the background when you see stimulating visuals?\n\nAben : Yes, but it starts out much more abstract, calling them voices or whispers is too tangible for how they begin. They don't become voices until I engage them.\n\nJapa : Engage them?\n\nAben : It's like… you know how some people are shy and easily steamrolled by others?\n\nJapa : Yeah.\n\nAben : It's like that. I have to give it a quiet moment of attention, otherwise it is just like that person who has something to say, but someone who just won't push or fight for chance to speak, however, once they open their mouth and start talking then they have so much pent up to say and they just start rambling non-stop.\n\nJapa : Do the voices ever tell you to do things?\n\nAben : Arg!... there… that's the kind of stuff…\n\nJapa : I'm sorry, I didn't think before I spoke that time. That's a silly stereotype based on ridiculous media and entertainment portrayals. This all just sounds so … unfamiliar to me.\n\nAben : It shouldn't. That's what bugs me most, people have such extremely distorted stereotypes about this stuff, but it should be perceived and accepted as completely normal.\n\nJapa : What do you mean? It sounds like something so unusual. You think everyone should have  the same experience?\n\nAben : Yes, or at least something similar. We all have two hemispheres to our brain, they can act and think independently.\n\nJapa : I do remember some interesting studies and stuff about that. The connection between the two hemispheres was cut and people started to present very strange behavior, as if each side of their body was an individual person or something, right?\n\nAben : Yes, if the connection between hemispheres is broken then each hemisphere gets control of half of the body and can see from one eye. You can interact with either half independently. Take it further and if you make it so neither side can see what the other side sees or does, then it's almost like interacting with two separate people… almost.\n\nJapa : Almost? I kind of remember but it's faded, refresh my memory.\n\nAben : So only left-brain can speak. You can use text cues to talk to either brain independently by only letting one eye see it. If you ask right-brain, not letting left-brain see the instruction, to pick up an object, then right-brain will do it, but left-brain won't know why that happened. If you ask left-brain, with voice, why the object was picked up, it will invent a rational sounding excuses like 'because that is the best object from the options available'. The person literally starts making up excuses and believing their own lies, the speaker doesn't know why they picked up the object but they give confident wrong answers for why they did it.\n\nJapa : Oh yeah, the left hemisphere, our speaking hemisphere, is full of B.S. haha, I remember now.\n\nAben : Kind of, left-brain is just really good at rationalizing, and seems to give answers even when it doesn't know the real reason. It's probably very hard for it to comprehend seeing its own body  perform an action but not know why, so it just makes up a rationalization.\n\nJapa : O.K… so I think I get it, you are saying that we all have two voices, one that can talk and one that relies on telling the other one what it wants to say. You think the right hemisphere is the other voice that you let, or coax to come out.\n\nAben : Basically, yeah. Technically everyone should have a right brain always whispering to their left brain. Right brain is more involved in visual skills, body language, spatial awareness, artistic capacities, and so on.\n\nJapa : So when you give it the floor to speak, what is it like?\n\nAben : It feels like I just give it a voice, at the same time it feels like it is me, but I still don't know exactly what it's going to say until the words come out.\n\nJapa : So you say it out loud?\n\nAben : I can use my inner voice, but that is a much softer effect.\n\nJapa : Softer?\n\nAben : Before I give it a voice it's just an idea, it's unformed and abstract, it's like how sometimes you know what you mean but you can't quite put it into words, almost like it's in a quantum state and only by speaking the words does it collapse into something concrete. When using the inner voice it doesn't feel like it fully collapses, at least not as hard and tangible as using a full spoken out-loud out voice.\n\nJapa : I totally get that, sometimes I try to paint a visual I have in mind and only when I put brush to canvas do I realize the visual feeling didn't have a tangible form yet and it takes shape as I paint.\n\nAben : Exactly, and I bet as you're painting, sometimes you say \"nope, that's not it\" and you have to redirect, modify, or back up and start again.\n\nJapa : Of course.\n\nAben : Well, that's what I do, only with speech.\n\nJapa : But speech triggered by visuals? I can totally relate to inner speech or talking to yourself, but I don't understand the whole visual trigger part.\n\nAben : I feel the same way about you and your auditory stimulated visuals… O.K….\n\nSo it's kind of like a strong visual can create an urge to say something I won't quite know what at first, not until it takes form. Also, whatever I'm seeing or looking at imbues character and personality into the voiceless-voice, or I guess the right-brain voice. I can start the conversation anytime I want. On the one side, left-brain, there is a voice that seems rather consistent, and on the other side there is a voice who takes on all sorts of personalities.\n\nJapa : So it's like one person talking to a crowd? Or….\n\nAben : More like one person who is very literal and direct trying to talk to a very unstable person with multiple personalities, not so much like a crowd. The unstable right-brain voice can change its personality at any moment, like an improv actor who easily switches hats and characters.\n\nJapa : That sounds like a very frustrating conversation haha.\n\nAben : Literal voice might think that sometimes, when I actually do full-blown out-loud speech with myself it's often like one character trying to interrogate or pin down an opponent into a fixed meaning.\n\nJapa : And that voice changes every time you see something?\n\nAben : More like when a new form occupies my internal visual space, I can retain the character longer by holding on to the internal visualization. I can of course also use memories and imagination in place of actual sight.\n\nJapa : This sounds so similar to visualizing sound. If I focus on a song I know well I'm able to create a mental playback and it can generate visualizations, and if I hum or tap or sing then it can be even stronger.\n\nSo I'm curious.. Does umm…\n\n*Japa looks around*\n\nJapa : …this is gonna sound weird, but does that tree say anything? Does it have a personality?\n\nAben : Yes, of course it has a personality\n\nJapa : What does it say?\n\nAben : …this feels weird… doing this on request... out loud… with a tree in public…\n\nJapa : You have come this far, what do you have left to hide?\n\nAben : …I guess…\n\nJapa : So… what does it say?\n\nAben : Look at me…. I am big and grand, I cast such a wide shadow… but don't touch me, stay away. Look, appreciate, but don't touch!\n\nJapa : … O.K…. that made sense… well… your tone kinda shifted a bit there.\n\nAben : First I saw the canopy of leaves, then I looked down and saw the rough protective bark on the trunk.\n\nJapa : So that's it… it's basically just personification, but a rough feeling based on visuals. That's not so weird, very useful for an artist I would think.\n\nAben : Oh no… That was just giving it a voice and a few words, I didn't engage with it.\n\nJapa : Well then… On with it!\n\n*Aben jumps into a rapid fire dialogue, no pause or hesitation between the self-exchanges*\n\nAben : You are a bit of a tease!\n\nI'm not a tease, I'm just private!\n\nYet you stand out, so grandiose and proud.\n\nYes.\n\nBut then you act all cagey and protective.\n\nYes, so what, are you saying I'm not allowed?\n\nI guess I can't say you're not allowed to be yourself, but it seems you want attention yet at the same time don't really want anyone to get close.\n\nI want attention and admiration, of course, don't we all, but I am cautious\n\nWhy?\n\nLook at how thin my trunk is, yet it alone supports this massive canopy.\n\nI see\n\nIf I was not carefull and protective it would not take much to bring me crashing down\n\nThen why do you broadcast your presence\n\nThat is my purpose, it is who I am. I shoot up and branch out, I grow and grow.\n\nUntil when?\n\nThere is no when. Just growth. Branches into the sky, roots into the earth.\n\n… I could keep going on like that for pretty much as long as I want\n\nJapa : I love that… Wow…\n\nAben : … Thanks… I guess…\n\nJapa : I'm going to try doing that sometimes… Maybe I can learn to do it too. I do understandard why you are so reluctant to open up and talk about it, there are definitely a lot of stereotypes to overcome and misunderstandings to navigate.\n\nAben : Oh yes! It has been a long time since I have been open about this kind of stuff.\n\nJapa : So what about people? Do they stimulate the same effect?\n\nAben : Of course. People have very strong voices, I can have so many conversations in my head just being in public spaces seeing lots of people.\n\nJapa : What about while you are talking to them?\n\nAben : Kind of... A bit, but not so much. Engaging in conversation with a person largely drowns out the effect.\n\nJapa : But it's still there?\n\nAben : I guess it's kind of like a predictive whisper, maybe… like it is reading their voice, facial expressions, body language, and the situation, trying to guess what they are thinking.\n\nJapa : I get that, I think everyone does that on some level, and like you pointed out earlier, the right brain reads body language and the left brain is the speaker, I think most of us just call the right brain voice by other names based on what it says, like intuition, instinct, or empathy.\n\nAben : Yeah. I'm curious, those visuals of yours, are they kinda grouped into types and styles? Do they pop out in your art like functions? Can you call them up when you need or want them?\n\nJapa : Yeah, for sure. I guess you could say I collect them, I use them alot in my… wait… I have realized that your questions are actually descriptions of your own experience in disguise haha… you collect voices don't you?\n\nAben : You got me… yeah.. Is that weird? They are super helpful for brainstorming, problem solving, and introspection.\n\nJapa : Do you have a collected copy of me?\n\n*Aben smirks*\n\nAben : …yes…\n\nJapa : O.k., if I'm being honest, that feels a bit weird. What is it like?\n\nAben : Well, you know how people often say \"What would X person do?\". Do you ever do that?\n\nJapa : Yeah.\n\nAben : Well, probably like that. Except I have a lot of practice doing it and I have full conversations with an approximate emulation of your personality… well, to be precise, with an emulation of how I perceive you to be. I'm sure my copy is not accurate in many ways.\n\nJapa : Does this version of me have memories?\n\nAben : I do imbue it with our shared experiences and things I know about you. Also it does often have awareness of things you wouldn't, I can't completely quarantine it from my own knowledge and memories. It's just an approximate emulation. I don't really control the way it works, it's an abstract skill I have developed.\n\nJapa : You do this for everyone?\n\nAben : I guess… I mean I do it even for people I don't know, even for inanimate objects.\n\nJapa : And new stuff just kinda gets added to your collection or repertoire?\n\nAben : Yeah.\n\nJapa : So the way I collect visual styles and aesthetics… you collect… souls?\n\nAben : That sounds so creepy… I collect characters.\n\nJapa : O.k., fair enough… characters.\n\n*Aben looks up and sees a one-way street sign*\n\nAben : So… after all that, is your perception of me permanently changed? Was me opening up like that on a one-way street? Can you go back to treating me like a normal person?\n\nJapa : Ha! You think I considered you normal!?!? Even putting all this aside, you are a super eccentric individual.\n\nAben : So you won't treat me any differently now?\n\nJapa : Oh, I'm pretty sure it will affect how I see and talk with you, I can't just pretend I didn't hear all of that. This stuff directly affects our conversion process, but I can promise you I'm still your friend, and this is just one more eccentricity in an already mile long list of your peculiarities haha.\n\nAben : I guess I couldn't ask for more. Thanks for keeping an open mind.\n\nJapa : What are friends for. Y'know, I wonder… you experience visuals that become voices, I experience sounds that become visuals… is it possible to do both? Like can it be a two-way street?\n\nAben : Left-to-right and right-to-left?... wouldn't that create a feedback loop?\n\nJapa : Good point, I guess someone like that would lose touch with reality pretty easily huh?\n\nAben : I'm tethered to reality by sound. You are tethered to reality by sight. What would people be like if they didn't have a tether?\n\nJapa : I imagine this is actually one of those matter of degree things, I bet everyone does experience both ways, just matters of degree.\n\nAben : You're probably right, I bet there is a bit of a feedback loop for everyone, that's probably why it seems like everyone is only partially living in the shared reality while also living in their own personal feedback loop, the feedback loop is probably a bit like a self-induced simulation or delusion.\n\nJapa : Agreed, I wonder what happens if that feedback loop grows? Or if it is intentionally fed and trained? What would that…\n\nVoice : Aben! There you are! Sorry I'm late\n\nAben : No worries Japa, I was just… Talking with myself\n\nJapa : I got those concert tickets.\n\nAben : Sweet, I love this band, their music always feels like a glowing magical forest.\n\nJapa : A vivid description… So where to?\n\nAben : Let's walk the wrong way down that one way street over there.\n\nJapa : Awesome, haha… You are so random, I love it.\n\nAben : Random is just what people think when they are missing information hehe, but you know what makes great random number generators.\n\nJapa : What?\n\nAben : Generative feedback loops… hahaha\n\nJapa : You are so weird sometimes.\n\n*Aben grins proudly*\n\nAben : I know! \"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Sunlight dappled the water, casting shimmering patterns that danced in Japa's vision, each ripple a note in an unheard symphony. The cafe's melody drifted out, a siren's call that tugged at Japa's consciousness.\n\n\"That song,\" Japa mused, her thoughts spilling out like water from a tilted glass, \"it's as if the sunrise has been distilled into sound. Can you feel it, Aben? The way it paints the air golden?\"\n\nAben's mind, ever the pragmatist, struggled to grasp the ephemeral concept. \"I... it's pleasant, certainly. Relaxing. But golden? I'm afraid I don't quite...\"\n\nTheir conversation flowed like the river beside them, meandering through the landscape of their differing perceptions. Japa's world was a kaleidoscope of sensory interplay, where sound birthed color and rhythm spawned form. Aben's reality was more concrete, yet no less complex - a realm where visuals whispered and inanimate objects found voice.\n\nAs they settled into the cafe, the music enveloped them. Japa's knee bobbed in time, her mind awash in a sea of abstract imagery. Aben watched, fascinated and perplexed, as always, by the mystery of his friend's inner world.\n\n\"Close your eyes,\" Japa urged, her voice soft as the cafe's ambient hum. \"Let the music in, let it paint pictures in your mind.\"\n\nAben's eyelids fluttered shut, but the darkness behind them remained stubbornly empty of the vivid tableaux Japa described. Instead, a faint whisper began to form, as if the darkness itself were finding its voice.\n\nTheir dialogue danced around the edges of their perceptual divide, each trying to bridge the gap with metaphor and analogy. Japa's world was a canvas splashed with auditory hues, while Aben's was a chorus of visual voices.\n\nAs they left the cafe, the city street became a stage for their continuing exploration. The tree they passed was no longer just a tree to Aben, but a character in an unfolding drama, its bark and branches forming a personality that spoke volumes.\n\n\"Look at me,\" Aben murmured, giving voice to the tree's silent proclamation. \"I am big and grand, I cast such a wide shadow... but don't touch me, stay away. Look, appreciate, but don't touch!\"\n\nJapa listened, entranced by this glimpse into Aben's inner dialogue. The world around them seemed to pulse with new life, every object and passerby a potential conversation, a story waiting to be told.\n\nTheir walk became a journey through twin realities - Japa's world of synesthetic wonder and Aben's realm of personified visuals. The boundary between their perceptions blurred, each finding echoes of their own experience in the other's description.\n\nAs they approached the one-way street sign, its stark simplicity sparked a moment of reflection. Aben's voice, tinged with vulnerability, broke the contemplative silence.\n\n\"After all this, Japa, can you still see me as... normal? Or have we crossed a line that can't be uncrossed?\"\n\nJapa's laughter bubbled up, light and genuine. \"Oh, Aben. Normal? You? Even without this revelation, you've always been beautifully, wonderfully eccentric.\"\n\nThe sign's arrow pointed decisively in one direction, but their friendship, their understanding, had become a two-way street. As they continued their walk, deliberately striding against the arrow's instruction, their inner worlds continued to unfold and intertwine.\n\nThe city hummed around them, a symphony of sights and sounds, each element a note in their ongoing dialogue. And as they walked, side by side, their perceptions - so different yet so fundamentally alike - created a harmony all their own, a unique melody in the grand composition of human experience.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to a Woolfian style, emphasizing stream-of-consciousness narrative, lyrical prose, and deep psychological exploration.

{"id": "text_completion_057", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Hemingwayesque: Characterized by concise, straightforward prose, minimalistic descriptions, and an emphasis on dialogue.\n[Reference Story]: \"Achilles.\" I call to him standing right at the threshold of his tent, not quite coming inside, but letting the outside in with me. I want to force him to hear the screams that I have had to endure the entire day. Multiple days, even.\n\n\nHe looks up, still absentmindedly plucking the strings of his lyre. \"Ah, Patroklos, I have been wondering when you would come.\" He smiles, the same sweet smile he uses when he tries to get his way with someone, whether it is with slave girls or army generals. It will not work on me. \"I have not seen you in a few days. Where have you been?\" He turns his attention back to the lyre, tuning already tuned strings, not even waiting for my answer. His laid-back attitude forms such a big contrast with the events going on outside, it almost makes me want to tear that lyre out of his hands and drag him into the sands outside by his hair, but I manage to control myself.\n\n\"Our men are dying\", I say, ignoring his attempt at conversation like he has been ignoring the war.\n\nHe looks up again, with feigned shock on his face. \"Our men? That can not be true. Did I not instruct them to stay in our camp?\" He flashes another innocent smile, signalling that he knows very well what I meant.\n\n\"Not our men, but…\" I struggle to find the right words, the ones that he will not immediately reject, like the multiple peace offers he has rejected in the last few days. \"Other Greeks. Fellow Greeks. They are dying and they need our help. Your help.\"\n\n\"Well, they are not my men, so that is not really my problem, is it? It sounds like you should complain to their own generals about it, not to me. Or maybe to Agamemnon. Yes, if you feel so strongly about those men, you should tell Agamemnon about it. It is all his fault, after all.\" He spits out the name of our general like it is the name of a deadly disease. It might as well have been. Agamemnon has caused more death and suffering in the Greek camp than all diseases combined. Just not this time.\n\n\"You of all people should know that is not true.\" I struggle to contain my anger, wanting to beat some sense into him. I am not dressed for battle, but even with my bare hands I could hurt him. The only problem is that he could hurt me more.\n\n\"No.\" The harshness of his voice does not seem to fit his relaxed expression. \"You are wrong. It is his fault. All of it.\" He puts down the lyre and leans lazily against the side of the tent. \"Gods\", he whispers, brushing his golden curls away from his eyes. When he is out of armour, behaving like a teenager trying to seduce a lover, it is hard to imagine him as the killing machine that he is. \"I am so tired of this conversation. Do you have anything fun to say, or are you just going to complain the whole time?\"\n\n\"The Trojans are at the camp.\" I can see a slight shift in his body language, his muscles tensing for a moment, before he forces them to relax again. I should have said that earlier. \"They have breached the walls and are killing Greeks like bugs.\" He opens his mouth to object, but I just raise my voice and keep going. \"And even if you do not care about the other Greeks, the Trojans will be on this side of the camp soon enough and they will kill your men too. Your men, who are not ready for battle, because you will not let them fight. They will be slaughtered.\" I pause to let him say something now, but he stays quiet. \"They are burning the ships. Even if we manage to survive this day, there will be no way for us to get home. We – you­ need to act now, before it is too late. Before everyone is dead, including you!\"\n\nI can see that struck a nerve. He is just as mortal as everyone else and he is just as much aware of it as them, if not more, since he knows he will not leave the grounds of Troy alive. He crosses the length of the tent before I can even see him get up – swift-footed Achilles – and stands before me, his dark eyes staring into mine. His angry expression matches the one of the monster he becomes on the battlefield.\n\n\"I will not fight for them\", he says, accentuating every syllable. \"This is their punishment for dishonouring me. They will have to suffer, so they will know the mistake they have made.\"\n\n\"When will they have been punished enough? When they are all dead?\" I have to fight the urge to step away from. He is not much taller than me, not even broader, but his godly aura reminds me of his strength.\n\n\"They took my honour away from me and I am simply taking it back\", he says through gritted teeth. I am afraid that he will be the first to attack if I do not leave him right now. I am reminded of when we were boys, laughing together and dreaming of when we would be warriors. I would never have been scared of him then. I still do not step back.\n\n\"What honour will be left for you after this battle, after our men will have died? Troy will still stand and Helena will still be inside. There will be no stories to tell, no one alive to even tell stories, no honour, no glory!\" I did not notice that I started yelling, until I hear the crowd that has gathered behind us. When I look back, they scatter. \"And those that do survive, the ones that make it back home, do you think they will praise you? No, they will hate you, they will curse your name for letting their fellow men get slaughtered like pigs! They will hate you!\" I pause to take a breath, to stop my hands from shaking with rage, when I see he has taken a step away from me. \"And for what?\" I continue, more calmly now. \"A girl? Honour? Are all these lives really worth less than your honour?\"\n\nHe is looking at the ground, avoiding my eyes. \"I will not fight\", he says quietly. \"No matter what.\" His stubbornness had always been a problem, but what used to be an annoying trait of a sweet boy, will now be the death of him. And of a lot of other people too.\n\n\"Then at least let your men go. Let me go.\" A plan occurs to me while I am speaking, the words coming out before I can think them over. \"I will go. With your armour. I will go with your armour, so everyone will think I am you. Our men can fight again, the Trojans will flee for just your appearance, and you will not have to do anything. You can save lives by doing nothing. Just let me go.\"\n\n\"No\", he answers immediately, not even taking a moment to think about it. \"It does not matter whether it is you or me, if they thinks it is me, it will have the same effect. They will think I relented.\"\n\n\"And they will praise you for it! You can tell Agamemnon the truth, if you want, so he will not think you gave up your feud. We can tell all the men the truth tomorrow, even, if that makes you feel better. Right now, it is not about Agamemnon, or about honour, but about lives. Human lives!\" I can see his defences cracking. He is about to give in, but I am not done with him yet. There is a rage inside me that has been building ever since this strike of his has begun, or maybe even longer than that, and right now it cannot be contained anymore. \"For once, just for once in your life, can you care about anyone other than yourself? Or will you die holding on to grudges no one else cares about?\"\n\n\"Fine\", he snarls. \"Fine, you can go.\" I broke him. He turns around, his hands shaking with what is probably rage, but I hope it is fear. \"Call the men. You will leave as soon as possible.\"\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHe insisted on helping me put the armour on, even though he clearly does not want to be close to me right now. I let him without complaining, even when he squeezes my arm or pulls the buckles too tight. I can not afford to anger him right now. He does not say a word the whole time, and neither do I.\n\nWhen everything has been fastened as it should, he picks up the helmet, the most important part of my disguise. Most men would not be able to pick me out of a crowd without looking closely, but Achilles is always recognizable by his beautiful blond hair. If even a hair of my own dark locks would be visible under that helmet, my cover would be shattered and the Trojans would know that whoever it is they are fighting, it is not Achilles. They will fight with more courage when they are not afraid of his godly strength, and, unlike him, I can not take on the entire Trojan army on my own.\n\nHis hands brush away the stray hairs on my forehead, gently, like they have already forgotten the rage that made them squeeze my arms just now. I am reminded again of when we were just kids, when he had made it a game to mess up my hair when I was not paying attention and laugh at how ridiculous I looked. Then he would fix it again, carefully detangling the strands by hands, because he knew I did not like to look bad when he always looked perfect. I never managed to get him back. He always caught me before I could get close.\n\nHe fits the helmet over my head, pulling me out of my memory. \"Do not take this off\", he says, the first words he has said since giving me his permission. I nod and the helmet slides forward a bit, slightly too big for my head. He sighs, annoyed, and puts it right again, together with the few hairs that had fallen out. I try to catch his eyes, but he purposefully looks away. He checks the rest of the armour one more time, retying something that has gotten loose, less tightly this time, before he turns away from me again. I take this as permission to leave, so I start to walk away to join our men outside the tent.\n\n\"Patroklos.\" He pulls me back, his fingers curled tightly around my arm. I can feel them trembling against my skin. He finally meets my eyes and I can see my own reflection in his dark eyes. I do really look like him. \"Do not dishonour me\", he says.\n\nIt feels like such a ridiculous thing to say in this situation that I almost laugh. Instead I just smile, in the same way he always would. \"You do not need me to do that for you.\" I pull my arm away and he lets me go.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe battlefield is louder than usual. The sounds of battle are now mixed with the sounds of the camp, the cries of livestock mingling with the screams of men. I can see fire in the distance, our only way out of Troy burning up. Our men are trying to save as much of the ships as they can, but when they also have to battle Trojans at the same time, it is harder to focus on the burning wood.\n\nAutomedon urges the horses to go as fast as they can, making the wheels of the chariot carve deep tracks into the sand of the beach. The men follow behind us, eager for battle. It takes me a while to hear what they are chanting, when I realise it is his name. Achilles, Achilles, the steady beat that guides us forward. We did not tell them of our plan, they have to believe I am him for it to work. They will fight twice as hard if they believe it is their godly general leading them in battle.\n\nWe pass empty tents and abandoned meals, with bodies laying motionless between them. The Greeks who were stationed here must have been able to push the Trojans back far enough, to the heart of the camp, where reinforcements were waiting for them. Or maybe they are all dead. The number of bodies does indicate that.\n\n\"Almost there\", Automedon says, skilfully dodging the corpses, even at this speed. He does know of my true identity, because he would see the difference between Achilles and me, even with the helmet. He sees Achilles up close every day, standing next to him on the chariot, and I would not be able to fool him with my face and my voice, but he is trustworthy, he would not betray me, not even on accident.\n\nWe are getting close to the battle, where the Trojans are pushing the Greeks far back into the sea. There are not that many of them, and we have fought far greater troops of the Trojan army, but the element of surprise was their strongest ally. They caught us off guard, unarmed and unprepared, and now that the battle has been going on long enough for the Greeks to catch up, the added chaos of the burning ships feeds the Trojan victory. The first soldiers spot us – I can not see whether they are Greek or Trojan – and they start to run. Now that I know for certain they are enemies, I take up a spear and hurl it in their direction. I am not used to fighting from a chariot, since that honour only comes to generals, like Achilles, but the spear hits its target perfectly. The Trojan soldier falls dead in the sand.\n\nAchilles! It's Achilles! I can hear the Trojans shout in fear, while the Greeks shout with excitement in response. The enemies flee for my appearance, they flee for the fighter they think I am. I am almost disappointed; that first kill felt good, and I want to see how many more I can kill before they see through my disguise. I do not have his godly gifts, his speed or strength or accuracy, so I can only miss so many times before they must realise I am not him, but I do not care. He is not here to stop me.\n\nHe said not to dishonour him. Well, what could bring more honour than killing Trojans?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe midday heat is beating down on us, making the smell of blood and dead bodies worse, almost unbearable. I will not let it stop me.\n\nMy arms are covered in slick blood – someone else's – making it hard to hold a spear without it slipping out of my hand. I drag my hands across the coarse sands of Troy and get ready to fight again. I have lost count of how many men I have killed today, but it feels like more than I have ever killed in the last nine years of war. They stay away from me now, afraid of the great Achilles. I want them to come closer, so I can look them in the eyes as my blade stops their heartbeat. I have lost count of how many men I have killed, but I want more.\n\nWe managed to drive the Trojans out of the Greek camp, back to their city with its great walls. Most of them are in there now, hiding like cowards. I want scale those walls and kill them off one by one. One life for every man they took from us and then the rest of them too, as interest.\n\nI have gotten separated from Automedon a while ago and I can not see him anywhere on the battlefield anymore. It does not matter anyway. I can walk to Troy by myself, I do not need his godly horses to carry me. This way, I can kill any Trojan that dares to cross my path.\n\nThe rest of the Greek army is still behind me, but they do not follow me to Troy. They start to retreat to camp, to tend their wounds and rebuild their tents. They must be cowards, like the Trojans. Hiding when the city is ours for taking. I continue to walk towards the great walls, ready to take this city on my own.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe walls are higher than I thought from far away and I have never been good at climbing. Now that I have not met a Trojan I could kill in a while, the arrogance that came with being a cold-blooded war machine – that came with being Achilles­ – slowly drains from my body, leaving room for me to think. I can not take these walls on my own. There are still other Greeks with me on the battlefield, engaging in combat with the last few stubborn Trojans, but they are tired. And so am I.\n\nI start to retreat. I will not run, because then they will know I am not swift-footed Achilles, but I walk, slowly, with purpose, still ready to fight. I will join my fellow Greeks who are still battling for their lives, join them so it will not look like I am running away from battle. Achilles would kill me if I made the Trojan think he had ran. Then, when all the leftover Trojans are dead, we can retreat together. We will take Troy another day. It can not stand for much longer.\n\n\"Achilles!\" A loud voice calls out across the plane, accompanied by the grinding of wheels on the sand. I look up, trying to find the source of the voice. I only realise when I see the chariot coming right at me that he was calling to me.\n\n\"Do you really think you can run from me?\" Hektor yells, stopping his horses only a short distance away from me. He leaps from the chariot, sword and shield in hand. \"Today you will pay for all the lives you have taken!\" He still shouts, even though he is close enough for me to hear. He looks up at the walls of Troy and when I follow his gaze, I see the people of Troy standing there, waiting to see their best fighter kill the one who has brought them so much pain.\n\nThe best of Trojans against the best of Greeks.\n\nI will not give them the fight they want to see, but I can give them something worth remembering. I do not say a word, afraid he will not fight me when he hears the wrong voice, but I draw my sword and get ready to fight.\n\nTo kill.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe blood gushes over my arms, splashes of it covering what little of my face is visible. The rush of the fight ebbs away now that it is almost over. Just one more push and another life will be taken to the Underworld. It had not been an easy fight. I had been tired, while Hektor, who had not been fighting with the Trojans at the camp, still had the energy to kill, but I still fought, longer than I thought was possible, until one of us fell.\n\nHektor looks at me with dark, pleading eyes. \"Please\", he says, blood rushing out of his mouth with every breath. \"Please, give my body back to my family.\" He looks so miserable; I almost feel sorry for him. He is my enemy, he has killed many of my men, he does not deserve mercy, but I can at least give him the one thing he asks for.\n\n\"Why would I not?\" I whisper, not wanting the people on the wall to hear me. \"You have fought well, Hektor, and you died with honour. Your family should be proud.\" I give a final push to my sword, pushing it deeper into his stomach, in the gap between his armour. I look into his eyes as the lights go out, smiling gently, not because I enjoy seeing him die, but because I want him to know he does not die alone. His body goes limp. I get up and pull my sword out of his body, unsure of what to do now. I decide to close his eyes and move away from the body, so that his family can come get it, like I promised. I do not take his armour, although it would have been expected for me to do. He was a great warrior; he deserves to carry his armour to the grave.\n\nI can hear the wailing coming from the Trojan walls and when I look, I can see the shock on their face even from the distance. One woman tries to throw herself of the wall, fighting back against the ones who hold her back. His widow, perhaps, or his mother. I feel bad for her, since she has done nothing to me or the Greeks to deserve this pain, but Hektor did deserve to die, so there is nothing that I could have done to spare her. I wonder if there is anyone who would react like that if I had been the one to die.\n\nBehind me, the Greek army erupts in cheers. I had not noticed they were there, gathered to watch my battle with Hektor. Automedon is with them, waiting till I give him the signal to come get me, and we will ride victorious back into the camp, where I will be received as a hero.\n\nNo.\n\nNot I.\n\nAchilles.\n\nI can hear their chants, the same as before. Achilles, Achilles. I have been fighting in his name, killing in his name, but this victory should be mine. I did all the work, while he just sat back and watched our men get killed. He does not deserve this honour.\n\n\"No!\" I yell, unsure if they can hear me over all the shouts. \"I am not Achilles!\" I pull the helmet off my head, revealing my dark hair. The shouts die out and everything goes quiet, so quiet I can hear the gasps coming from the Trojans on the wall. I turn around to face them. \"I am Patroklos, son of Menoitios, and I am the one who killed Hektor! Remember my name!\"\n\nThe Greeks cheer again. They do not care whether it is me of Achilles who killed Hektor, as long as somebody did it. Automedon comes to pick me up with the chariot, but when I get on, he has to support me, so I do not fall down. I am tired, so tired, but I have to keep standing for a little bit longer, while the Greek army sings my praises. They started chanting my name now.\n\nPatroklos, Patroklos.\n\nBest of Greeks.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\"Hektor is dead\", I say, as I pull open the tent and throw the helmet at his feet. Achilles freezes, while the slave girl he is holding in his arms – Daïda, a young girl who has been spending most of her time at camp in Achilles' tent – frantically attempts to cover herself. Even though he made such a big deal out of Briseïs being taken, she never was his favourite.\n\n\"Leave\", he snarls at her and she obeys, running out of the tent while clutching her torn dress to her chest. When she passes me, I can see that she is crying.\n\n\"What did you say?\" He slowly gets up but does not turn to look at me.\n\n\"Hektor is dead\", I repeat, louder this time.\n\n\"How?\" He still does not face me. \"That is impossible. I am the only one who is able to kill him.\" There is a quiver to the edge of his voice, barely audible, betraying his uncertainty. Or his fear.\n\n\"I killed him\", I say, the words filling me with pride.\n\nThe knife is against my throat before I can even see him move. \"You?\" He laughs mockingly. \"You killed him? You are lying! You are not capable of that. No one is. Only I am!\"\n\nI can feel the sharp blade against the skin of my neck, not yet hurting me, but ready to end my life if he wishes to. \"Whether you believe me or not, he is dead anyway. You can ask the men, or anyone else. They all saw his body and they saw me kill him. You can ask them, and they will tell you I am telling the truth.\"\n\n\"No!\" He pushes the knife down with more force, a small cut appearing on my neck. I do not move away while the blood trickles down. After all the fighting I have endured today, a cut like this feels like nothing.\n\n\"Do you really wish to kill me, Achilles?\" I ask calmly. I see the rage burning in his eyes, a madness that would have been useful on the battlefield today. \"Do you not realise what would happen to you if you kill me?\" I gesture to the world outside, where our men are celebrating the death of their fiercest enemy. \"I saved their lives today. I killed Hektor for them, something you would not do for the past nine years. I am their hero. They already dislike you, do you want them to hate you? They might even kill you. Is that what you want to achieve, Achilles?\"\n\nHe moves the knife away from me, stumbling a few steps backwards. He is crying, large tears rolling down his face while he chokes on his own breath. He used to cry a lot when we were boys, every time he would get hurt or disappointed, but he got used to feeling pain quicker than I would have liked, and tears were now reserved for the occasions when hurting someone else would not work.\n\nHe hesitates, his whole body shaking, before he jumps forward again. I instinctively block whatever attack it is he will throw at me, but he just holds out the knife, the handle ready for me to grab, the blade pointed right at his heart. \"Then kill me\", he says. \"Kill me yourself, so they will not have to do it.\" His eyes do not meet mine, but I can see his entire soul displayed in them. They remind me of Hektor's, right before he died. There is nothing left of the fierce warrior he once was, no confidence or fearlessness or pride, only sadness.\n\nWhen I do not accept the knife, he forces the handle into my hand and guides the blade up to his neck. \"Kill me. I want you to do it. I will die soon anyway. It does not matter whether it happens now or later.\" His hands keep mine fixed in place, with the knife pointed at his neck, his frantic eyes looking for any sign of agreement on my face. \"There is nothing left for me. No honour, no title, no enemies to fight. You have taken it all away from me! I am useless!\" He yells the words, jerking my hands closer to his throat. \"I am useless now. I do not deserve to live any longer.\" He has stopped crying, the tears run dry. In their place is a pleading look, the same one Hektor used when he asked me to return his body. \"Please.\"\n\n\"No.\" I pull my hand free from his, surprisingly easily, and let the knife drop to the ground. \"I will not kill you. Not now.\" He does not resist when I pull his trembling body close to me in a tight embrace, afraid he will collapse if I let him stand on his own any longer. \"You are not useless. You are Achilles, son of Peleus and a goddess, best of Greeks and best of men. You made a mistake, but you can make it right again. I will help you. You can be better.\" I can feel his head nod against my shoulder, his golden hair stained by the blood from the cut on my neck. \"There are still many more Trojans to kill. We will take the city together and with it, you will regain your honour. You will die in fierce battle, like you are supposed to, not in this tent by my hand.\"\n\nHe pulls away from me, wiping the last of the tears off his face. \"I will fight tomorrow\", he says, determination in his voice. \"I will show Agamemnon what he lost when he insulted me, and he will have no choice other than honour me like he should.\"\n\nI smile. \"We will fight tomorrow. Together.\"\n\n\"Together.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

The rock that was their sanctuary didn't seem like such a great idea to hide behind now. Three cadets. All wearing standard issue Star Division cadet uniform but each had one area in which they could attach their own little flair in the form of a button.Cadet Jackson. the one with their grandfather's old Star Division jacket buttons screamed over the noise of energy beams and concussive grenades that they needed to get out of there and fast!\n\n\nAll of a sudden the sound of weapons dissipated. All that could be heard was the distant sounds of commands being barked. It was alien and robotic sounding but they knew the universal language of orders. Kind of like music. \"Ok here is what we are going to do.\" The cadet with the button displaying the logo of his favorite holo comic was speaking. \"I'm going to look over the rock and count how many are out there real quick. I tried to count based on where I thought the beams were coming from but I lost count when they started throwing the grenades. Them things are so freakin' loud! I was up to 4 confirmed before that though, what about you guys?\"\n\nThe two other men didn't know how to respond. Their shuttle had been shot down during a routine recon mission. Well they were told they were picking up data about the area that was covered in what seemed like an endless woods. What's routine about your first mission though? Their commanding officer, hoping to sleep walk to their next promotion, was last seen flying out the front window of the shuttle due to the centripetal force the shuttle experienced after being hit. He was part of one of the 'Old Star Division families. Believed it blaize for an officer to wear a harness on their own bridge. The cadets had also not known each other before setting foot on the shuttle together 20 minutes ago. They were a little taken a back by the way the other cadet was handling the situation. Like as if they weren't about to die horribly but hopefully quickly. They just looked at each other and back.\n\n\"Eh. Maybe I've actually gone deaf and am speaking too softly! Cadet Riley can you hear me?!\" the third cadet said in a raised tone before the others quickly shushed them. \"Christ yes Cadet Portman, can hear you just fine.\" RIley, who was missing their flair button and looked to be the type to always be in a disheveled state replied. \"And we heard you, so go look quick!\". Portman shot a quick grin which unnerved Jackson and Riley and crawled to the precipice of the rock and peered over for what was probably a few seconds too long before Jackson snapped to get the fuck down before they got sniped. Portman shuffled on their behind to back down towards the other two who where anxious to know how many they were up against. Portman let out a big sigh. \"I'm not gonna lie to you fellas. I forgot what I was supposed to do the second I popped my head up\". Jackson and Riley stared back mouths agape. Unable to tell if they were serious or not. \"Have you guys ever heard of the doorway effect?\" was all Portman could say before the dirt left in the wake of a suppression grenade rained down on them. And the firing started again.\n\nPortman screamed that he remembered just when Jackson pulled him back and spotted 4 figures in the near distance. It was 5 in total. He guessed the the fifth guy was Mr Grenades. He also clocked a bunch trees that seemed to be rotting away a bit and formulated an idea. But he needed their knives. A cadets only weapon, it was more ceremonial than anything as it wasn't very big. But right now they felt like excalibur in their hands as it was their only weapon. \"Quick!! Give me your knives!\" Portman hurriedly asked, trying not to sound like an order but it was do or die. Riley gave theirs over almost right away. They didn't know why but they felt like Portman knew what they were doing. Jackson needed a further persuasion of a head tilt, one eyebrow raised and the outstretched hand of Portman opening and closing quickly to hesitantly hand over their only means of personal defense. Portman hurriedly got to work by unlacing their boots.\n\n\"Have you guys ever heard of the story of Icarus?\" portman started. This time it was Jackson raising one eyebrow but in confusion. Portman took the lull in firing again to elaborate as he appeared to tie all the knives together. \"There he is sitting at home in Greece or wherever he lives. He just got done from a long day inventing shit all day long or whatever inventors do.\" Riley and Jackson quickly side-eye each other. Portman is too enveloped in the task at hand that he doesn't notice.He continued on. \"And then in comes his wife and is all like 'Look I know that the wheelchair that you invented for my Mother was amazing and all and no one has ever seen anything like it at all. But like how the eff is she supposed to get up all the stairs and talk to Zues at the acropolis. It is only 500 meters from the base of the mountain. And the first step is 300 meters right to the base of the mountain. Ugh why can't you be smart enough to figure out the slope OF A PERFECT RIGHT ANGLE!!! ' So off she goes and storms away.\" Portman looked like he was finishing up just as the firing was starting up a little more.\n\n\"So Iccarus is all like 'WTF' but he goes about trying to figure out if it is even possible to know the slope of a right angle. But just like that he has a dream where an equation hovered above him and had an epiphany. The next morning he put on his little boots with wings, grabbed his little bow and arrow and off he went and made the best gosh darn ramp Greece had ever seen leading right up to the acropolis. Icarus proudly pushes his mother in law up the ramp. It was a little bit steep but he powered through just in the hopes that this will finally satisfy his wife so she'll stop nagging. He just wanted to chill and just think about stuff like cool people did. But when they got to the top of the ramp do you know what they did?\". It was a rhetorical question but Riley shook their head anyway, fully engrossed. Jackson's eyes were as narrow as slits but was glad at least he was entertained in his final moments.\n\n\"He just bent over and whispered in her ear, 'a2 + b2 = c2 bitch.' and then just let her roll down the ramp. I guess he never installed brakes.\" Portman let out a guffaw before pulling the laces taught and bouncing up. He began swinging the knives around like a lasso but almost impossibly fast. It flung from his fingers and zipped right towards the bunch of very tall but very dying sets of trees. About 6 or 7 trees started to domino on each other and on to their new found enemies. Once the dust had settled there was no sound, not even orders being barked over a radio. Jackson turned to portman, still unable to believe what he just witnessed.\"You know, I think you have your mythologies and fables mixed up a bit there. And somehow math.\" Portman looks back at Jackson. \"Ye but what I was doing seemed like a long shot andI didn't have time to be talked out of it. So I went with the confuse route. But also I wasn't joking about them grenades!\" Portman shot Jackson a smile but this time it didn't unnerve him at all. \"Ok new plan!\" Portman exclaimed while giving Jackson a bump to the shoulder. \"I say we move to recover what we can and head south.\" The three men nodded in agreement and they started in their way….\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The rock, once a symbol of shelter and safety, now seemed as fragile as the hopes and dreams that had brought these young men to this godforsaken patch of earth, where the ancient trees stood witness to the unfolding chaos, their gnarled branches reaching skyward in silent supplication.\n\nCadet Jackson, his grandfather's old Star Division jacket buttons gleaming dully in the fading light, felt the weight of generations pressing down upon him as he screamed over the cacophony of energy beams and concussive grenades, his voice raw and desperate as he urged his companions to flee. The sound of his own fear echoed in his ears, mingling with the memories of his grandfather's tales of glory and honor, now nothing more than dust in the wind as the reality of their situation bore down upon them with merciless intensity.\n\nAs suddenly as it had begun, the barrage of weapons fire ceased, leaving in its wake an eerie silence broken only by the distant, alien commands barked in a language that transcended the boundaries of space and time. The cadets, their hearts pounding in their chests like war drums, strained to make sense of the guttural sounds that seemed to reverberate through the very earth beneath their feet, a stark reminder of the vast gulf that separated them from their unseen foes.\n\nCadet Portman, his face a mask of forced bravado belying the terror that gripped his soul, spoke up, his words tumbling forth in a torrent of nervous energy as he proposed a plan to assess their dire situation. The holo comic button affixed to his uniform seemed to mock him now, a childish affectation in the face of impending doom, yet he clung to it as a talisman against the encroaching darkness that threatened to engulf them all.\n\nAs Portman peered over the rock, time seemed to stretch and warp, the seconds ticking by with agonizing slowness as Jackson and Riley held their breath, their minds racing with thoughts of home and family, of the lives they had left behind and the futures that now hung in the balance. When Portman returned, his confession of forgetfulness struck them like a physical blow, their hopes dashed against the cruel rocks of reality as they struggled to comprehend the magnitude of their predicament.\n\nIn that moment, as the suppression grenade rained dirt upon their heads and the alien weapons once again shattered the fragile peace, the three cadets found themselves bound together by the shared experience of fear and desperation. Their individual stories – Jackson's legacy of service, Riley's disheveled appearance hiding a keen mind, and Portman's irreverent humor masking a quick wit – merged into a single narrative of survival against impossible odds.\n\nAs Portman fashioned a makeshift weapon from their ceremonial knives, his rambling tale of Icarus and right angles serving as a bizarre counterpoint to the life-and-death struggle unfolding around them, the very landscape seemed to hold its breath. The dying trees, their bark peeling away like the layers of civility stripped from the cadets by the crucible of combat, stood as silent sentinels to the unfolding drama.\n\nWhen Portman's improvised lasso of blades felled the rotting trees, bringing them crashing down upon their alien pursuers, the forest itself seemed to exhale, releasing a breath held for countless millennia. In the aftermath, as the dust settled and the silence stretched out like the endless expanse of the Mississippi Delta, the three cadets found themselves transformed, no longer mere boys playing at war but men forged in the fires of adversity.\n\nAs they set out southward, their steps carrying them deeper into the heart of the alien-infested wilderness, the cadets bore with them not only the weight of their mission but the accumulated history of the land itself.

As he went for his first steaming sip he was interrupted by a squawk and a call, \"Mr. Frog!\" - he nearly spilled his cup due to the urgency in the voice of the caller. Hastily placing the coffee next to him on the stump, quickly but not so quickly as to spill it, Mr. Frog went to inspect the disturbance on an otherwise perfectly peaceful day.\n\n\nAs he rounded the far side of the barn, tripping over his own feet, he saw a most horrific site. Sara, the oldest hen of the farm whom Mr. Frog had grown to be good friends with over the past few years, being carried away by the farmer. \"Sara!\" shouted Mr. Frog as he went after the farmer. The farmer felt a slight tug on his pant leg and turned around to find a small toad dressed in a dirt brown suit jacket and pants who was clearly out of breath (Mr. Frog is not known for his athleticism), covered in dust from the gravel, with the hen in one hand. \"It's Frog\" said Mr. Frog, panting.\n\n\"What?\" inquired the farmer.\n\n\"It's Frog, my name I mean, you called me toad but it's Frog, but that's beside the point.\"\n\nMr. Frog was rudely cut off by the farmer, \"But you're obviously a toad, what kind of a name is Frog for a toad? Downright confusing if you ask me\", said the farmer.\n\n''But I didn't ask you! What I am asking you is what are you doing with my friend?'' said Mr. Frog, returning the conversation back on track.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the farmer, \"this old girl is gonna be dinner\"\n\n\"What y-you can't eat her!\" said Mr. Frog.\n\n\"Well that's the plan\", said the farmer. It was all silent for a moment and then Mr. Frog broke the silence.\n\n\"What if I get you something better than a chicken for dinner?\" said Mr. Frog.\n\n\"What could be better than chicken? \" said the farmer.\n\n\"The troll's broth,\" said Mr. Frog confidently. The farmer laughed for a while, then went into his home, placed Sara into a cramped metal cage and returned with a tiny glass bottle no bigger than a thimble.\n\n\"Okay if you can even fill this then I will give you the hen, aw heck I'll even buy you a new jacket!\" (of course the farmer did so not thinking Mr. Frog could ever steal something, let alone from the troll).\n\nMr. Frog took the bottle and went on his way into the woods.\n\nChapter 2 - A Seat and a Game\n\nMr. Frog had been in the woods only a handful of times, but he preferred the dry warmth of his home. Mr. Frog's home is a humble place made from scraps of wood and metal cans, yet it is certainly more inviting than the wet and cold woods that surrounded him.\n\nMr. Frog marched on through the new growth until he came to a wooden table with three figures seated at it. Mr. Frog approached the figures in hopes that they may point him in the way of the troll's den, but before he could get out a word he was greeted by the head of the table.\n\n\"Hello, hello, sit and join us, we were just about to begin,\" said the thing that sat at the head of the table, a brownie, it almost looked like a man but was much too small, could not have been more than a foot, dressed in a brown tunic that was kept in place with a piece of string around his waist, and a long and crooked nose stabbed out from his face. \"Oh where have my manners gone off to? My name is The Head.\" With the bells on his long, curled shoes ringing The Head of the table got up and ushered Mr. Frog to a seat on the right from his chair.\n\n\"Your name is what?\" said Mr. Frog.\n\n\"My name is The Head of the table but most just call me Head, and these are my friends The Right Hand and Left hand\" said The Head, jestering to a pair of squirrels sitting on the left hand side.\n\n\"Well actually I was wondering if you could tell me the way to the troll's home\" said Mr. Frog\n\n\"Oh, but you must stay, we're about to start,\" said the Head.\n\n\"Start what?\"\n\n\"Well, the games of course.\" The Head of the table reached under his chair and placed a wood box on the table, as the Head of the table opened the box, the Hands both rolled their eyes and sighed. The Head began to pull out game piece after game piece after game piece, and began to explain the rules. The complexity of the rules made Mr. Frog's head spin. After an eternity of waiting for the Head to explain the rules of the game, Mr. Frog checked his pocket watch. Dread painted Mr. Frog's face, it had been an hour and the game had not yet even begun.\n\n\"We always play that one,\" said Right Hand.\n\n\"We need a new game,\" said Left Hand.\n\n\"What about a game of hide and seek?\" said Mr. Frog\n\n\"Yes!\" said both Hands.\n\n\"No, the rules have been read and the game has already begun. Do you really want to change games now?\" said the head of the table.\n\n\"Yes,\" said left hand.\n\n\"Yeah, what he said,\" said Right Hand.\n\n\"Fine\" grumbled the Head, \"but who will go first?\"\n\n\"I will\" said Mr. Frog. The Head, Right Hand and Left Hand all put their heads down on the table, covered their eyes and began to count. Mr. Frog used this as an opportunity to take his leave and ran off into the woods. \"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

He lifted the steaming mug of coffee to his lips, desperate for warmth, when a blood-curdling squawk pierced the eerie silence.\n\n\"Mr. Frog!\" The urgency in the voice sent shivers down his spine. He set the mug down, his webbed hands trembling slightly.\n\nAs he rounded the weathered barn, the wood creaking ominously, Mr. Frog's eyes widened in horror. There, in the gnarled hands of Farmer Wilkins, was Sara, the eldest hen on the farm. But something was wrong. Sara's eyes were glazed over, her body limp and unnatural.\n\n\"Sara!\" Mr. Frog cried out, his voice cracking with fear.\n\nThe farmer turned, his face a mask of shadows. \"Well, if it ain't the little toad,\" he drawled, his voice dripping with malice.\n\n\"It's Frog,\" Mr. Frog corrected, his words barely a whisper.\n\nThe farmer's eyes narrowed, a sinister grin spreading across his face. \"Frog, toad, don't matter. You'll all be in the stew pot soon enough.\"\n\nMr. Frog's heart raced. He knew the farmer's reputation for cruelty, but this was different. There was an otherworldly darkness surrounding him.\n\n\"What if,\" Mr. Frog stammered, \"what if I get you something better than chicken for dinner?\"\n\nThe farmer's laugh was like nails on a chalkboard. \"Better than chicken? What could be better?\"\n\n\"The troll's broth,\" Mr. Frog blurted out, instantly regretting his words.\n\nThe farmer's eyes glowed with an unnatural light. He disappeared into the house, returning with a tiny glass bottle that seemed to pulse with an eerie energy.\n\n\"Fill this,\" he hissed, \"and the hen is yours.\"\n\nMr. Frog clutched the bottle, its coldness burning his skin, and set off into the woods.\n\nThe forest was alive with whispers and shadows. Eyes peered at him from hollow trees, and the ground seemed to shift beneath his feet. Mr. Frog's heart pounded as he pushed through the undergrowth, the bottle a constant, icy reminder of his task.\n\nSuddenly, he stumbled upon a clearing. In the center stood a wooden table, three figures seated around it. As Mr. Frog approached, the air grew thick and oppressive.\n\n\"Welcome, welcome,\" crooned the figure at the head of the table. It was a brownie, no taller than a foot, with a face that seemed to twist and change in the dim light. \"I am The Head. Join us, won't you?\"\n\nMr. Frog found himself seated at the table, unable to refuse. The other two figures, introduced as The Right Hand and Left Hand, were squirrels with unnaturally intelligent eyes.\n\n\"We were just about to begin the game,\" The Head said, producing a wooden box that seemed to vibrate with dark energy.\n\nAs The Head explained the rules, Mr. Frog felt his mind slipping away. The words twisted and writhed, burrowing into his brain like parasites. An hour passed, though it felt like an eternity.\n\n\"Hide and seek,\" Mr. Frog suggested desperately, clinging to his last shred of sanity.\n\nThe Hands eagerly agreed, and as the three beings covered their eyes, Mr. Frog fled into the depths of the forest.\n\nThe trees seemed to close in around him, branches reaching out like gnarled fingers. In the distance, he heard the rumble of the troll's lair. Mr. Frog clutched the bottle tightly, knowing that his quest for the broth was far from over, and that the true horrors of the forest were only just beginning.\n\nTo be continued...", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to a Kingian style by incorporating elements of horror, suspense, and supernatural phenomena.

{"id": "text_completion_060", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Lovecraftian: Features cosmic horror, elaborate mythologies, and a sense of existential dread, often with archaic language.\n[Reference Story]: It's 4:15AM. I bolt upright, bag my bedding, and stow it. Then strip naked in the mop pit where I shower. The water's hot, and the building comes alive around me, ready to fling out twenty thousand meals a day or be closed—something neither of us want.\n\n\nI suit up in my battle fatigues—yesterday's overalls. Unisex polyester, microporous, and fire retardant. These coveralls provide the needed splash resistance from hot grease and food chemicals. More than clothes, they're a suit of armor to fight back famine. I can ignore the reek for another day. I get a small incentive if I'm in the top 10 fewest used per shift hour. I'm ranked number one on that metric and I ain't about to vacate THAT triumphant throne.\n\nThe building, store #5455, is sorting and double-checking the inventory in my impromptu sleeping area making sure inventory's 100% accurate—never know when rats, the non-human or human varieties—have pilfered the stock. Logistics is the lifeblood of all power and #5455 rivals the US Navy. Lettuce needs a top-off, but since no one orders salad before 10:30 AM the AI's gonna gamble a farm drone can drop off forty heads before then. I trust it, and don't override.\n\nI stand in my two-by-two box watching the monitor, it's the only place I'm certain my building's machinery won't accidentally kill me. Company metrics are up on the display. I'm still number one. Then, I close my eyes for about thirty seconds and await the ramp to fall as man and machine storm the beach of our particular D-Day.\n\nThe machines hum. A symphony of staccato sounds begin, pop-pop-pop as air is pushed out of the lines by various food slurries. A sparse rainbow of three-color LEDs glow red, yellow, green and #5455 is alive.\n\nI've been working with this version for five months, and it's the best a fast-food building management software can be. I resist upgrades, but when the corpo code monkeys beg authority to force-push an update, I spend the wee morning hours talking to #5455, getting it to unlearn their fantasy and relearn our reality. It's exact template of building, location to supply and demand, and software is shared by no other location. Fortuitous for sure, but I'm also min-maxing every stat.\n\nI hardly do it for the money anymore, which is as thin as our patties. I do it for Victory. This store's the best run in the entire country. And if it's the best in America, then it's the best in the world. London or Tokyo sometimes get top in Sales $s, but their long supply chains don't deliver the margin. Margin makes Management happy, because it makes the Market happy.\n\nAnd this is AMERICA baby! We might be overfed and undernourished, but we're not starving like the communists. I take great pride in #5455, (district one-niner: DroneCor's Finest)\n\nRight now they're lined up four cars deep to get their MugEgg, FatSlap, Eggotic, or whatever from the permutation forest that is our menu. Nowhere else can I find that kind of validation. Cars of every class, from Hondas to Bugattis, line up for me.\n\nI scan the orders coming in, but from the specific mechanical cacophony I already know the orders. Bacon wrapped doughnut holes, a ten count of egg and gruyere cheese bites, and—\n\nWhat? The klaxon wails and the pasta machine flashes out a red warning.\n\nSomeone's got the enunciation of a toddler with a root canal and 54-55 misinterprets it. It orders me to load a reel of uncooked pasta. Customers are crazy, but no one's ordering two PastaBowls at 5AM.\n\nI listen to the order's recording. 'Asta'ole. I hear it. Yeah, it sounds like PastaBowl, but I know RastaRoll's a breakfast item. A combination of green, yellow, and red ingredients which is rarely ordered. I've never had it. In fact, I never eat breakfast—need to stay lean to slip between the machines to fix them.\n\n\"Hello,\" I say through the speaker. \"Did you want the RastaRoll or were ya ordering the PastaBowl,\" and give special enunciation on the Rs or the PB.\n\n\"RAstaROlls,\" they yell back.\n\nCrisis averted. I override Fifty-Four's interpretation and the warning light dies and I preserve our customer satisfaction score (CSAT). While I'm here, you'll never get cheated out of even a paper-thin strip of bacon. But I'm not chasing CSAT monomanically, they've promised me the impossible if I hit all my metrics.\n\nLater, some punk high-school kids roll up. I know because I listen to them preface the order with: \"Imagine you're a very generous chef, picture yourself constructing the best breakfast burrito, and giving it to us, the needy for free…\"\n\nI roll my eyes so big #5455 can practically measure my disdain dripping like the grease off our hash-browns. Someone tries that scam like every day. Store #5325 probably falls for it, because they're tanking our district, but not me, not in my house.\n\nBefore they trick my poor AI into giving free meals, I cut in. \"Whatta'ya want?\" I bark out the squawk box. They recoil, and sheepishly order two Battered HamFists and combo #2. I don't win by giving up the easy high ground.\n\nBreakfast's beachhead was conquered, and now we're pushing inland towards lunch. My building reconfigures internally. In the lull I sip water and check my metrics. I'm still #1; enough to single-handedly pull my district into second, but there's hot competition. An operator out of Atlanta (three hours ahead) had a strong afternoon. I need to stay #1 for THE big reward.\n\nMy first savory, sweet, salty taste of immortality came when our very own CEO called me out on the investor conference. 'Store Fifty-Four-Fifty-Five' he said to Wall Street. There's also a special incentive. Real immortality to numero uno: They'll send a bunch of egg-heads to investigate my success and clone my mind out to our nineteen thousand locations.\n\nThe company gives me shares to keep me upright, but I know a guy from another location which says the board can veto any sales, so they're worth less than unicorn farts in a magic kingdom. I'm here for that penultimate bonus for the #1 operator.\n\nMaybe I'm deluded, but it's not my only motivation. I'm doing something America needs. Sure as she still needs rubber on the wheels, she needs food for the road.\n\nIt's a minute or two past 10:30 and the first 'lunch' order rolls in. Early! I don't judge anyone's eating habits, but the building's still rearming itself for lunch.\n\nI look at the camera. It's a big truck with a black brush guard, but it's too clean to have ever been off-road. I listen to the end of the order. \"… And don't mess it up like last time!\"\n\nI gasp.\n\nTwo twenty-five piece orders of Nuggets Overloaded!\n\nWe call it 'N.O.' for a reason. It's a death sentence for my metrics. On a normal day, Nuggets Overloaded strains the five-minute order guarantee, but this joker ordered it three minutes into the seven-minute reset limbo. #5455's still converting. Like that Japanese carrier caught rearming its planes in the Battle of Midway, this guy catches me at the worst moment.\n\nI hop out from my safety cage and talk loudly so #5455 knows where I am at all times and his stainless steel appendages won't mistake mine for a slab of fresh beef. I slap the big red button. It drops every unneeded tool. From behind, stainless steel warming trays strike the ground loudly like exploding flashbangs.\n\n\"Fire up everything!\" Nuggs Overloaded need an array of tools, three appliances, and a buffet of ingredients. \"Fifty bacons, any-size. Now!\" There's a slight difference between breakfast and lunch bacon, but that's a minor metrics hit compared to a late lunch.\n\nThere's a whoosh as the natural gas goes full throttle, spittin' out literal fire! I pull nuggets out and basket them. The fry oil's still warm from breakfast, and deep-six them into that fryer hell.\n\nI duck an overhead gantry which is moving the cheese curds. An arm drops from the ceiling next to me, slaughtering chives: chip-chop-chip. There's still enough biscuit gravy left over from breakfast, because the AI hadn't cleaned that pot yet. I slather it on the base of the syrofoam container, lay it out on construction counter one, and hop back into my safety square.\n\n\"Sir.\" I say over the horn, \"Your order will take a few more minutes. Would you like a complementary drink?\"\n\nHe snarls and pulls into the slide-by without a response, allowing the other (hopefully happy) customers get on by. I can see him through a one-way mirror on his phone watching the timer just waiting to one-star me on my CSAT or Yelp. If he needed them quick, he should have ordered ahead.\n\nMy display glows irate red. In 30 seconds, alarms will flash. #5455 hasn't had a late order in four days.\n\nNuggets bounce on stainless steel, and ten free mechanical hands wrap each nugget in bacon. Hoppers for the remaining ingredients assume formation overhead. One's for Bakon-Bombs, another is the spice revolver. The third stands ready to shred the final cheese.\n\nThe timer hit zero, and we're late. Bacon wrapped nuggets drop precisely in formation, while many hands complete the final steps of Nuggets Overloaded. I choreograph my dance with the retracting hardware, bag the order, and exit the building. With a smile I say, \"Thanks for coming to DroneCor! Have a good day.\"\n\nHe's white with rage, but immediately drives off with his order. He stops to check the order and I duck back in. I watch him on camera. He slowly turns his truck around and gets out.\n\nThe jack-head pounds on the hidden door, trying to get in.\n\n\"Back-off Chief,\" I say over the speaker.\n\n\"Oh, CHIEF?\" He yells.\n\nNow he's absolutely furious. Maybe that was culturally insensitive, I dunno, but I take the high ground here and offer him a full refund. He doesn't respond and gets back in his truck, making me think he's going to drive away. Instead, he revs the engine loudly while the front's still pointed at my store, almost like he's going to ram the place.\n\nHere's the problem. The fuzzy problem. If he damages the wall, it gets repaired, no sweat, and #5455 hums along fine. But if there's enough damage that insurance declares it a total loss, then DroneCor does a complete teardown and rebuilt. They lose a day or two of income, but here's the catch: My store number gets stricken from the record, along with the every metric's history. I've seen it happen to an entire district down in hurricane country.\n\nChief revs his engine further, and now his back wheels are burning rubber.\n\nI press the silent alarm and unscrew a wooden mop handle. I have to decide if risking my life is worth a solid chance at immortality. Someone's got to defend the machine from abuse. So I go outside and stand between my store and the customer. A mega-modern David versus Goliath.\n\nYou got your Nuggets Overloaded in seven minutes instead of five. Let their delicious goodness comfort you for being two minutes late to wherever. Don't fight me, pal!\n\nIt's like he can read my mind, or sees the crazed look in my eyes. He peels out the lot and into the wave of traffic.\n\nBy the end of the day my metrics recover from Nuggets Overloaded. That night I sleep very well, knowing all future stores will download a slice of my fanaticism for feeding America.\n\nBut in the middle of the night it hits me. I laugh hysterically. Even if they copy me, they can't replace me.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

With practiced haste, I stow away the meager comforts that cushioned my fitful slumber and make my way to the cleansing chamber. There, beneath the scalding torrent, I perform the ritual ablutions that will prepare me for the cosmic horror that awaits.\n\nAs I don my battle-worn vestments, I can feel the ancient edifice stirring to life around me. Store #5455, a grotesque amalgamation of man and machine, readies itself for another day of satiating the insatiable hunger of the masses. The very walls seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy, as if the building itself were some eldritch entity from beyond the veil of human comprehension.\n\nI take my place within the sanctum of relative safety, a mere two-by-two box that shields me from the potential wrath of the mechanical monstrosities that populate this unhallowed ground. The glowing screen before me displays arcane symbols and figures, metrics by which our corporate overlords measure our worth. I remain atop this profane hierarchy, a position I dare not relinquish lest I face untold consequences.\n\nAs the first rays of the accursed sun breach the horizon, the ramp descends, and we begin our daily assault upon the sanity of man. The machines whir to life, their cacophonous symphony a mockery of natural order. Pipes and tubes expel their unholy contents, a rainbow of unnatural hues that no mortal was meant to consume.\n\nI have long since ceased to labor for mere monetary gain, for what value does currency hold in the face of such cosmic insignificance? No, I toil in service of a greater, more terrible purpose. For in this godforsaken establishment, I have glimpsed the truth of our reality – that we are but insignificant motes in an uncaring universe, and that our only solace lies in the fleeting moments of triumph we can wrest from the jaws of oblivion.\n\nThe day progresses, a ceaseless parade of eldritch horrors disguised as sustenance. I navigate the labyrinthine complexities of our menu, a tome of forbidden knowledge that would drive lesser minds to madness. Each order is a ritual, a sacrifice to appease the inscrutable appetites of our patrons.\n\nBut lo! A disturbance in the cosmic order! The klaxon wails, heralding an anomaly in the intricate tapestry of our routine. A customer's unintelligible utterance has confounded our artificial intelligence, threatening to unravel the very fabric of our operation. With practiced ease, I intercede, averting catastrophe and preserving the tenuous balance between order and chaos.\n\nAs the sun reaches its zenith, we transition from one hellish configuration to another. The building contorts and reshapes itself, a process as mesmerizing as it is terrifying. In this moment of relative calm, I reflect upon the ultimate prize that dangles before me like forbidden fruit – the chance to achieve a perverse form of immortality, to have my consciousness duplicated and disseminated across the vast network of our corporate empire.\n\nBut even as I yearn for this dubious reward, a creeping dread takes hold. For what manner of existence would such an \"immortality\" truly be? To have one's essence fragmented and scattered, forever bound to serve the insatiable maw of consumer culture – is this not a fate worse than death?\n\nYet I press on, driven by forces I scarcely comprehend. For in this cosmic joke of an existence, what choice do we truly have but to rage against the dying of the light, to carve out whatever meager victories we can in the face of an indifferent universe?\n\nAs the day draws to a close, I find myself triumphant once more, my metrics unassailable. But in the depths of night, as I lay upon my pallet awaiting the sweet embrace of oblivion, a terrible realization dawns. Even should they succeed in replicating my consciousness, they can never truly replace me. For I am unique in my madness, in my willingness to stare into the abyss and have it stare back.\n\nAnd so I laugh, a sound of hysteria and despair that echoes through the empty halls of Store #5455, a testament to the futility of our existence and the cosmic horror that lurks just beneath the surface of our mundane reality.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The response successfully transforms the style to Lovecraftian with cosmic horror, elaborate mythologies, and a sense of existential dread, using archaic language throughout the text.

Memories flooded my mind, especially those of a childhood friend whose laughter lingered in the recesses of my memory. Her image remained vivid—a bubbly girl with lush black hair intertwined into curls framing her rosy-cheeked face.\n\nIt was the summer of '99 when we shared a tender moment, our first kiss, just before I departed for Delhi, merely a month after my 13th birthday. Fate had swept me away, leaving behind cherished memories and an ache in my heart.\n\nReturning to Mussoorie, I sought her amidst familiar streets and homes, only to find her residence occupied by strangers. But fate always has a peculiar way of reuniting kindred spirits, I liked to believe so for faith was one of the few things keeping me together nowadays- I sighed.\n\nOne particular serendipitous day, while lost in the reverie of our past adventures, I glimpsed a figure in the woods—familiar, yet surreal. I raced out of the house at her sight and dashed after her, my heart pounding in anticipation but before I could get to her, she vanished into the foliage. Disheartened, I scoured the woods almost at the brink of losing hope of ever meeting her again until a tap on my shoulder jolted me. I whipped around and there she stood, the embodiment of my memories, in her spotless floral gown with her deer-doe eyes mirroring the longing buried within my own.\n\n\"Naina\" My chest rose and fell unsteadily, my heart heavy in this surreal moment.\n\nThough a stoic, her eyes ignited with fervency with her lips twisted into a tender smile as a wave of familiarity passed through her.\n\n\"Nikki...\" She uttered under her breath. A smile played on my lips as I nodded, my eyes tearing up with joy- only she could call me that out of all the people dear to me.\n\nNo more words were said, none were needed as she fell into my embrace. Even after all these years, I felt the same warmth as I had before leaving this place.\n\nThat evening we walked down the trail like we used to in the sweet bygone days. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, weaving stories of the past. She recounted her absence, the sale of her childhood home, and her new life in another part of town.\n\n\"It's so beautiful, this moonlit night\" She remarked as we trotted our way back\n\n\"Sure it is… just like the old days\" I remarked and then, partly hoping to spend more time with her, offered to walk her home.\n\n\"Thank you Nikki but don't worry yourself with it… I know these woods better than anyone, they don't let anything happen to me\" She replied. I found her response peculiar but decided not to press her further.\n\nWe met frequently after that, sharing moments lost to time, culminating in the reawakening of our young love amidst Mussoorie's enchanting fall. And then one evening, below the same deodar that had witnessed our selfless love blossom years ago, our love rekindled as stolen glances said more than what words ever could.\n\nYet, fate seemed to play its hand once more. Days turned into an anxious wait as she vanished, leaving me adrift in a sea of uncertainty. Desperation crept in, questioning my actions. The reunion that once kindled hope now brewed doubts.\n\nI wandered amidst the woods, seeking her in every familiar corner, each rustle of leaves raising hope and despair in equal measure. It was in those woods, in the hallowed serenity of our cherished spot beneath the deodar tree, that I found her again.\n\nI confronted her, partly relieved to see her. Perhaps I had been too bold that evening, maybe I had misinterpreted her gaze for loving glance… I thought\n\nBut this instance was different for her eyes, usually brimming with mirth and mischief, now held a sorrow I couldn't comprehend. She hesitated, her voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Nikki, there are things... I've been hiding.\"\n\nI urged her gently, reassuring her with a comforting squeeze of her hand. \"You can trust me, Naina. Whatever it is, we'll face it together.\"\n\nWith a deep breath, she recounted an unsettling revelation. Traces of anguish laced her words as she spoke about inexplicable marks on her wrists and neck- I noticed- a haunting reminder of a date etched into her memory—16th October 2003- Her 18th birthday.\n\nHer words came as a blow to my conscience as I failed to wrap my head around it. Yet her eyes were convincing enough to make me doubt my own perception of reality. Questions tumbled in my mind like leaves caught in a tempest but this tussle inside my mind subsided as soon as she revealed a piece of paper- a newspaper clipping.\n\nI took it with my fingers which trembled- my conscious filled with terrible foreboding. My heart sank as my eyes stumbled upon the headline- \"Mussoorie in Mourning: The Unsettling Truth Behind Murder of an 18-Year-Old\" the newspaper screamed, mentioning the name of my childhood friend, Naina.\n\nMy chest started feeling heavier as I found it harder to breath with each passing instance. I tenaciously tried to keep myself together, to hold back the tears that had started to well-up in my eyes but a mere glance upon her lush black hair playing willfully in gentle breeze save two curls that guarded her round, pretty little face pushed me over the brink as I started to cry my heart out. She was the sole remanent of my childhood that I adored… I found myself mourning the death of that part of me that ended with her.\n\n\"Why did you come again for me Naina…?\" I sniffled, remorse of leaving the town along with her weighing heavily on my conscious\n\n\"I could never leave you, Nikki,\" her voice trembled, choked with emotion. \"I had to protect you.\"\n\nConfusion mingled with the ache in my chest. \"Protect me? From what, Naina?\"\n\nShe placed a tender hand over my eyes, calming the torrent of questions inside me, and placed a gentle kiss on my cheek, a bittersweet gesture laden with a cascade of emotions. Her whispered words stirred the very fabric of my being.\n\n\"Why did you have to go Nikki?\" her words tore through my chest.\n\nTears cascaded down my cheeks, mingling with the remnants of her love. Eyes closed, I dared to surrender to the warmth of her touch, finding her face and drawing her close. Our lips met, an affirmation of an enduring bond, a union transcending the boundaries of time and fate.\n\n\"I won't ever leave you again... promise to stay with me till the end,\" I vowed, the words carrying the weight of a lifetime of longing. She enveloped me in her embrace, allowing us to melt in each other's arms and together we reclined on the grassy bed, reminiscent of our carefree days.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Thirteen years, an eternity, a heartbeat. The ancestral home loomed, a sentinel of bygone days, and within its weathered walls, her laughter echoed – a phantom, a promise.\n\nNaina. The name floated in my consciousness, a dandelion seed on the breeze of recollection. Her face, a kaleidoscope of impressions: lush black curls framing rosy cheeks, eyes sparkling with mischief and something deeper, something I couldn't quite grasp then. Now, the weight of understanding pressed upon me, a stone in the river of time.\n\nThe summer of '99 unfurled in my mind, a tapestry of sensations. The tender brush of lips, innocent yet charged with unspoken longing. The ache of departure, a month after my thirteenth year had dawned. Delhi beckoned, a siren call of progress and possibility, yet my heart remained tethered to this hill station, to her.\n\nI wandered familiar streets, now strange, searching for her essence in every corner, every shadow. Her home, once a sanctuary of shared secrets, now inhabited by strangers. The universe, in its infinite cruelty and kindness, had other plans. Faith, that fragile thread, kept me tethered to hope, even as doubt gnawed at the edges of my resolve.\n\nThen, a glimpse. A figure in the woods, familiar yet ethereal. My feet moved of their own accord, heart thundering, blood rushing in my ears. The foliage swallowed her whole, leaving me bereft, questioning my sanity. Had I imagined her? Was this the cruel trick of a mind desperate for connection?\n\nA touch. Light as a feather, heavy as destiny. I turned, and there she stood, Naina, my Naina, unchanged yet transformed. Her floral gown, pristine as memory, her eyes pools of longing that mirrored my own. \"Naina,\" I breathed, the name a prayer, a supplication.\n\n\"Nikki,\" she whispered, and in that moment, the years melted away. We were children again, untouched by time's ravages, pure in our affection. No words were needed as we embraced, the warmth of her body against mine a balm to my weary soul.\n\nWe walked, we talked, we remembered. The woods whispered our secrets, the moon cast its benediction upon our reunion. Yet, something lurked beneath the surface, a disquiet I couldn't name. Her words about the woods protecting her sent a shiver down my spine, a premonition I chose to ignore.\n\nDays passed, a blur of rediscovered joy and rekindled passion. Beneath the old deodar tree, witness to our nascent love, we came together once more. Glances spoke volumes, touches ignited fires long dormant. But fate, that fickle mistress, had not finished with us yet.\n\nShe vanished, leaving me adrift in a sea of uncertainty. Doubt crept in, insidious as fog, clouding my thoughts. Had I imagined it all? Was this reunion a cruel joke of my subconscious?\n\nI searched, desperate, each rustle of leaves a beacon of hope quickly extinguished. And then, beneath our deodar, I found her. But this Naina was different, her eyes wells of sorrow that threatened to drown me.\n\n\"There are things... I've been hiding,\" she said, her voice barely audible above the pounding of my heart. I urged her on, my hand in hers a promise of unwavering support.\n\nThe tale she wove chilled me to my core. Marks on her body, inexplicable yet undeniable. A date seared into her memory – October 16, 2003 – her eighteenth birthday. The newspaper clipping she produced was the final, damning piece of evidence. \"Mussoorie in Mourning: The Unsettling Truth Behind Murder of an 18-Year-Old.\"\n\nReality fractured, splintering into a thousand shards that cut deep into my psyche. Naina, my Naina, gone before her time. Yet here she stood, solid and ephemeral all at once. Tears flowed freely, mourning not just her loss but the death of innocence, of possibility.\n\n\"Why did you come again for me, Naina?\" I asked, my voice raw with emotion.\n\n\"I could never leave you, Nikki,\" she replied, her words a balm and a blade. \"I had to protect you.\"\n\nProtect me? From what? The questions swirled in my mind, a maelstrom of confusion and grief. Her hand over my eyes, her lips on my cheek – a gesture of comfort, of farewell.\n\n\"Why did you have to go, Nikki?\" Her words pierced my heart, an accusation and a plea.\n\nIn that moment, suspended between worlds, I made a vow. \"I won't ever leave you again... promise to stay with me till the end.\" Our lips met, a union transcending time and fate, sealing a promise that defied death itself.\n\nAs we reclined on the grassy bed, entwined in an embrace that spoke of eternity, I felt the boundaries of reality blur. Past and present, life and death, all melded into one timeless moment. In Naina's arms, I found home, I found peace, I found the courage to face whatever lay beyond. The woods whispered their ancient secrets, the stars bore witness to our love, and in that perfect, impossible moment, all was right with the world.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the Woolfian style effectively through the use of stream-of-consciousness narrative, lyrical prose, and deep psychological exploration of characters.

{"id": "text_completion_062", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Faulknerian: Utilizes long, complex sentences, multiple perspectives, and a deep sense of place, often set in the American South.\n[Reference Story]: The Giant Well\n\nAugust 1863\n\nThe scorching hot Kansas wind twisted around Isaiah Milton's face. His mother had named him after the haunting sound the wind made when it came through the front door of his childhood home: Isaiah.  It lured him back twenty years later, and he stumbled through the Kansas plains searching for it. Hunger grabbed his stomach and his throat was as dry as the dusty air. No food, no water, no refuge from the relentless sun beating down like a branding iron, The dusty trail dotted with blood from his blistered feet squeezed in tattered boots gave hope to the scavengers flying above proving the briefest moments of shade.\n\nNot that the vultures would have had much to eat. Isaiah, whose stunted growth had halted at the age of twelve, was little more than living bones wrapped in tattered remnants of an ill-fitting Confederate uniform.\n\nHowever, the way he looked was the least of his worries. His gaunt face and sunken cheekbones weren't enough to avoid sunburn causing his skin and lips to crack and bleed. Without shelter and new boots, he'd transform into tumbleweed.\n\nAn unhappy soldier, Isaiah walked away from the battlefield with his rifle but no plan for survival. It took some time before his troop noticed his absence, and even though they were better off without him, Isaiah knew they would come looking. When the Confederacy started paying soldiers to find, return, and execute deserters, poor Isaiah knew that without either a horse or a sense of direction, death on the battlefield would have been the better choice.\n\nIsaiah lost track of time. Had it really been a month since he walked away? Up until now, he was what they called a 'straggler' — someone who leaves the camp but eventually returns.\n\nEverything changed after day thirty. You got reclassified as a deserter. He had a target on his back and a reward on his head … or was it the other way around? He had no experience or training to outrun or outfight a group of vicious and ruthless men. Men who are willing to give their lives to maintain the slavery system aren't just dumb, he thought, they're dangerous.\n\nIsaiah's blistered feet throbbed as he trudged across the endless prairie. Up ahead, he spotted riders on the horizon, their forms wavering in the heat haze. A voice like his mother's whispered on the hot wind - \"Isaiah...\" He pushed onwards, trying to raise his spirits with an old marching song:\n\n\"When Johnny comes marching home again, Hurrah! Hurrah!\nWe'll give him a hearty welcome then….\"\n\nThe song died on Isaiah's cracked lips when he stumbled upon a massive pit sunken directly in his path. Perfectly round and twelve feet across, it looked too unnatural to be some old well. Nothing marked its location, indicated who had dug it, or hinted at what was at the bottom if it even had a bottom. Had he stumbled into it at night, Isaiah would've fallen in without a sound, never to be seen again.\n\nStanding at the edge, Isaiah couldn't see how far it went, just more deep darkness. A fast path to hell, he thought.—except there was a cooling breeze that escaped from its depths. \"Isaiah,\" it called, sounding more like his mother than the wind.\n\nCurious to gauge its depth, Isaiah picked up a rock not much bigger than a pebble and tossed it down. He stood silently, waiting to hear it hit the bottom, but he never did. As he listened, his eyes moved up to the horizon where he saw a boy watching.\n\nIsaiah was set to continue on the path — he needed a hole in the ground as much as he needed a hole in the head — when suddenly the rock he had dropped flew back out of the tunnel.\n\nIsaiah picked up the rock, which felt bigger than when he threw it. Again, he tossed it back down, this time with more force, and again he never heard the sound of it hitting bottom. A minute later, a rock flew out of the hole, this time nearly hitting Isaiah in the head.\n\nThe rock had changed again. This was not the same one, he was sure of it. This one was at least twice its size. Now more curious than ever, he reached into his knapsack and found a bullet. Isaiah flung the bullet into the pit and waited.\n\nHe saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Clearly, someone was watching him. Isaiah's eyes weren't playing tricks on him. It was a young boy, and Isaiah lifted his arm in a lazy wave. The boy did the same. As he watched the boy, Isaiah momentarily forgot about the bullet he had dropped until it came back up. Like the rock, it came back different; it was much more substantial. This bullet wouldn't even fit in his rifle. It looked like a mini-missile.\n\n\"What in tarnation?\" Isaiah mumbled to himself comparing it to his other bullets; it was more than double the size. He quickly scrounged in his backpack, found a small piece of stale bread, and gave it to the darkness.\n\nWhile waiting, he again looked for the boy, but he was gone. When the hole tossed the bread back up, Isiah clumsily caught it. Examining it closer it looked identical but bigger. Nearly the size of a loaf. It was cool to the touch and smelled like stale bread.\n\n\"Holy moly.\" He exclaimed nibbling at his magic meal.\n\nA voice, deep and dry called to him, \"Isaiah Molton?\" Isaiah jumped and spun around, his mouth full of bread.\n\nConfederate soldiers - led by a sneering captain - had Isaiah surrounded, rifles leveled. They'd finally caught up to the deserter.\n\n\"It's Milton,\" Isaiah corrected, eyeing the group of Confederate soldiers and the rifles aimed squarely at him. His own gun lay discarded on the ground nearby. The men stood ready on foot while their horses huddled together at a distance, stamping nervously. Isaiah kept chewing the stale bread defiantly, not wanting to spit it out and show any sign of weakness.\n\n\"Milton. Molton. It matters not. You will be forgotten. We are here to bring you to justice, deserter,\" their captain said stepping forward.\n\n\"You mean to execute me for abandoning your stupid war,\" Isaiah shot back.\n\n\"That is what I mean,\" the captain agreed, as the men approached. Isaiah stepped back, his feet only inches from the dark void in the ground.\n\n\"I am unwilling to fight your stupid war, but I am willing to fight you,\" Isaiah shouted casting himself into the inky darkness. The Confederate soldiers stared in disbelief, circling around the edge of the perfectly rounded hole. One chuckled at Isaiah's apparent act of crazed desperation. \"All of that work to watch the man leap into a hole,\" The soldier turned to the captain. \"We still getting paid, sir?\"\n\nThe captain exhaled a frustrated sigh, unamused by his subordinate's remark. \"Enough lollygagging. Mount up, we're returning to camp.\"\n\nAs the men turned away from the hole to return to their horses, an earth-shaking thump came from behind. Whirling around, their jaws went slack at the sight now rising monstrously into view.\n\nWhat had once been the scrawny frame of Isaiah Milton now loomed over them, less human and standing 12 feet tall, dwarfing the soldiers.\n\n\"You'll remember my name now, you worm.\" A deep, rumbling voice reverberated from the massive man. Even Isaiah was taken aback by his grotesque speech.\n\nBefore the soldiers could raise their rifles, one of Isaiah's massive hands lashed out swiftly, like a black bear, knocking the closest soldier violently to the ground. The others finally remembered to open fire, but the bullets bounced off Isaiah without leaving so much as a mark.\n\nIt was over in seconds. The once terrified young deserter swatted the remaining men away like gnats. From Isaiah's new, viewpoint he was a man fighting toddlers.\n\nThe battered Confederate soldiers finally retreated toward their horses, one shouting over his shoulder, \"This ain't over, freak! We'll be back with reinforcements!\"\n\n\"I'll be waiting,\" Isaiah's deep bass voice rumbled in response.\n\nOnce the men had fled, the towering giant turned his attention back to the mysterious pit. If they did return with hundreds more soldiers, he didn't think even his newfound gigantic stature could withstand their numbers. But if this strange hole could double his size once or twice more, increasing his size to 30 or 60 feet tall or more, maybe he'd have the power to crush the Confederates entirely.\n\nDrunk by his new power the promise of even more, Isaiah decided to tempt fate once more. Taking a deep breath, the desert wind whistling through his massive nostrils, the giant leaped back into the hole in the ground.\n\nA minute went by, and Isaiah was not tossed back out. Ten minutes later, it became clear he was stuck, or perhaps trapped, in the otherworldly pit; too large to be squeezed back out.\n\nThat's when a boy, a Native American no older than eight, cautiously approached, pushing a small cart piled with fruits and vegetables. One by one, he began tossing apples, squash, and ears of corn into the void, waiting for the food to double in size to provide more food for his tribe.\n\nOne by one, the boy tossed his offerings of fruits and vegetables into the pit, only for them to soon reemerge - transformed into massive versions that thudded heavily to the ground. When at last the final apple returned it had swollen to the size of a small pumpkin. But what made the young boy freeze in fright was a bite marked by teeth larger than a great white shark's. Terrified, the boy abandoned the mutated fruit to rot on the ground and hurried away, fleeing back to the safety of his tribe's village leaving the giant now too big to escape the underground world.\n\nThe next morning, the Native tribesmen returned, leading mules pulling supplies needed to cover the strange pit - lumber, tools, and materials. They carefully constructed a sturdy framework to bridge the gap. Once the wooden beams were in place, they covered it all with packed clay, dirt, and sod, camouflaging it to blend seamlessly with the prairie surroundings. Within a day, the location of the mysterious hole was utterly concealed and secret once more. If the Confederates returned they had nowhere to go and no one would believe their story.\n\nOver the century that followed, the existence of the otherworldly pit faded from memory as the area became settled. A few years later a school was built on the adjacent property and a playground for the children - swings, slides, and climbing structures built directly over where the void had opened up. Among the equipment were \"talk tubes\" - long pipes that allowed kids to communicate by speaking into either end.\n\nOne day, in a corner of the playground, a young girl played alone, ankle-deep in rubber mulch. She stood by the talk tube with no one on the other end to communicate with, but she laughed and sang anyway.\n\nA teacher, feeling bad for the youngster, went to the other end of the tube to give her some conversation. When she neared, she could hear the girl's song exiting the tube on her end - a marching tune about soldiers returning home.\n\nWhile the teacher thought the song choice was odd, when she heard the next line sung by someone with an impossibly deep voice, she freaked out.\n\n\"The men will cheer, and the boys will shout.\nThe ladies they will all turn out.\nOn that joyful day when Johnny comes marching home.\"\n\nThe terrified teacher immediately rushed to the girl and ushered her away from the tube. Later that day, the school janitor Benjamin permanently sealed both ends with concrete, cutting off any link to the depths below.\n\nBut even now, when you stand at the Middletown Middle playground on a hot August day and feel the warm breeze whispering Isaiah in your ear, you may also hear the giant singing his favorite song.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "text_completion_064", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Proustian: Rich, detailed prose that delves into memory and perception, often with long, flowing sentences.\n[Reference Story]: A cacophony of screams echoed through the abandoned city streets, bouncing off of battered buildings and skidding across crumbling concrete. A horrid and invasive sound that left Taylor nauseous. It was as if dozens, hundreds of people were screaming in unison, unleashing shearing shrieks that shook him to his very core.\n\nAnd then it stopped.\n\nTaylor's radio crackled to life. \"One down.\"\n\nIt took Taylor a moment to unclench his fingers from the grip of his rifle, his hands locked so tightly that all of the blood drained out of his fingers. He could not afford to lock up— those things wouldn't hesitate.\n\nA different voice spoke over the radio, belting out instructions for how to proceed. Taylor glanced around for a moment, then turned his attention back to the building he'd been assigned to clear. The building he had been about to clear— before the screaming started. Where there had once been a doorway, there was instead a gaping maw, a doorframe shredded into pieces. The encroaching darkness inside taunted him— daring him to come inside.\n\nTaylor really wished he didn't have to take the bait.\n\n\"This is Taylor. I'm south side, two blocks over. Building has been broken into, I need a Second to help me clear it.\"\n\nFor a moment, the radio was silent, barring the constant crackling of static. Then, he got his response.\n\n\"Denied.\"\n\nTaylor sighed. He clicked his headlamp on, the grimy bulb flickering to life and casting a dingy yellow glow across the shattered door frame. Taylor took deep breaths to calm himself, forcing his trepidation to the back of his mind. He had a job to do. Taylor peeked into the doorway and swept his light across the exposed downstairs. Much of the furniture had been shredded, thin gouges dicing leather upholstery into flakes of confetti. There were three doors, each leading to a different part of the tiny house. If he had to guess, one was a bathroom, one was a kitchen, and one led to an upstairs bedroom. The bathroom door was cracked open, the kitchen door was closed, and the divider which would usually block the upstairs off was almost all the way open\n\nTaylor swept his light back and forth, peeking into corners and looking for any shadows looming behind the furniture. He didn't see anything; the living room was clear. Taylor kept his breathing steady as he took slow and careful steps toward what he assumed was a bathroom door. It was already ajar, though not so much so that it seemed likely one of those things had made its way inside.\n\nTaylor kicked the door open, faux wood crashing into drywall as it slammed into the wall. Rifle raised, he checked every corner as fast as he could. The light from his headlamp trailed ahead of his vision as he glanced over each molded corner of the abandoned bathroom. Toiletries were scattered across the vanity, left forgotten as whoever lived here had fled. Taylor wished he could do the same.\n\nThere was nothing here.\n\nAnother room down.\n\nTaylor couldn't tell if he was relieved or not; if there was something here, it might have been better if he had found it immediately. Since the bathroom was clear, Taylor shut the door behind him. Instead of clicking closed, the door drifted back open a few inches.\n\nUpstairs, next. Taylor thought to himself. The kitchen door was closed, so if one of the creatures were here, it probably wouldn't be in that room. They didn't tend to close doors— there wasn't often anything left after they 'opened' one.\n\nTaylor slid the divider the rest of the way open. The scratching sound of plastic rollers rubbing against metal itched at his ears as the last quarter of the door retreated into the wall. With slow and methodical steps, Taylor crept up the stairs. Near complete darkness met him as he rounded a bend in the stairs, broken only by the all-too-thin beam of his headlamp. That self-same light was the only reason he could see, but Taylor couldn't help but worry that something else would see it— and him— first.\n\nThe bedroom was of decent size, appearing to cover the same amount of space as the living room, kitchen, and bathroom below. Taylor couldn't say why the building was designed this way, it seemed pretty inconvenient. He swept his light across the bedroom, once again shining his light into every corner one by one. Nothing. Each was empty, barring a few cobwebs. Taylor cast his light over the room again. The room was large and messy, enough so that there were plenty of spots for something to hide. An upturned dresser seemed to telegraph that someone— or something— had been inside here, presumably the same entity that had ripped down the front door. Clothes had been scattered around the room and piled against the foot of the bed in a shaggy, ugly mass—\n\nThose weren't clothes.\n\nSome kind of creature lay dormant at the foot of the bed, partially covered by and resting atop the shredded clothing spilling out of the dresser. It was massive, easily six feet long. Patches of fur hung limply off its body, the visible areas of skin rotted and grotesque.\n\nTaylor's grip tightened around his rifle, his blood running cold. This is what they were here for, this is what they were here to kill.\n\nBut looking at it now, Taylor didn't believe that his rifle could kill something that large.\n\nHe wasn't even sure it was alive.\n\nWith shaking hands, Taylor raised his gun. His headlamp came to a rest on what he assumed was the creature's head. He took aim.\n\nThe beast's eyes slid open.\n\nBlinded by the headlight, the eyes slammed shut, but Taylor could not shake the image of the sickly green slits out of his mind. His grip tightened on the trigger.\n\nThe beast's mouth fell open.\n\nIt unhinged.\n\nA cacophony of screams echoed through the house, as if dozens, hundreds of people were screaming in unison. Taylor's blood ran cold, his grip tightened. Bullets spat out of his rife. The normally deafening booms of gunshots tried— and failed— to contest the horrific sound of screaming. Taylor tried to keep his rifle pointed at the beast's head, the rapid-fire stream of bullets taking an eternity to land. The spray didn't immediately kill the beast. Its screams intensified, a deafening roar of pain blending with the screams and somehow somewhat drowning them out. Taylor took an involuntary step backward, his foot slipping over the top step of the stairs. Taylor lost his balance, his gunfire flying off target and peppering the roof. Taylor caught hold of the stair railings and yanked himself forward. The joints in his left arm screamed in pain as he forced himself upright, somehow managing to keep from tumbling down the stairwell. The beast fell back to the ground, back into its bed of clothing. Taylor unloaded the rest of his magazine into the monster, each bullet pounding into the beast's unresponsive body with sickening splatters.\n\nTaylor lowered his rifle, watching the unmoving mass of flesh with apprehension. His hands were shaking, his knees felt like they were going to give out underneath him, but the beast— the beast was still. That horrible noise had stopped, though Taylor wasn't sure when.\n\nHe did it.\n\nTaylor grinned. He'd killed one.\n\nTaylor engaged his radio. \"One down.\"\n\nSpent casings littered the ground around Taylor. Another mess in a house that would never be used again. He turned back towards the stairway and unlocked the empty magazine, wiggling it until it came free. Taylor slid it into his backpack and reached into his belt for a replacement.\n\nHis radio crackled to life, a voice congratulating him through the static as—\n\nTaylor froze, a sharp pain prickling through his abdomen. He looked down. A pair of thin, dark claws protruded straight through his stomach.\n\nTaylor screamed as pain welled through his body. More screams echoed behind him, a discordant stream of semi-synced wails reverberating through his body, pounding into his skull.\n\nTaylor fumbled at his belt, gasping for air and trying to find a new magazine to put into his gun. The screams, they didn't stop, he couldn't think, he couldn't breathe.\n\nThe claws ripped upwards, tearing through his chest as they shredded flesh and bone alike. Taylor's voice choked silent as the claws bit into his throat. He collapsed. The claws slid free. Taylor couldn't feel anything except a paralyzing pain. He couldn't hear anything except the agonizing, repetitive screams beating at his ears. He couldn't see, his vision hazy and blurred— tinged with red. He knew he needed to get up, but his body wouldn't move.\n\nAnother voice joined the chorus, one Taylor recognized through the haze of pain and veil of discordant sound. Taylor's own voice sang, locked in a scream of agony— a derisive snapshot of his final moment rising to join the cacophony that serenaded the abandoned city streets.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "As Taylor stood before the abandoned city streets, a flood of memories washed over him, each one more vivid than the last, intertwining with the present moment in a tapestry of sensory experience. The cacophony of screams that suddenly erupted seemed to emanate not just from the physical world around him, but from the very depths of his consciousness, as if every fear and nightmare he had ever known had coalesced into this singular, horrifying sound. The echoes bounced off the battered buildings, their crumbling facades a testament to the passage of time and the decay of civilization, and skidded across the concrete that had once been smooth and pristine but now bore the scars of neglect and violence.\n\nThe screams, a horrid and invasive sound that left Taylor nauseous, reminded him of a time long past, when he had been a child at a carnival, the shrieks of delight from the roller coaster merging with the cries of terror from the haunted house, creating a dissonant symphony that both thrilled and terrified him. But this, this was different, more primal, more urgent, as if dozens, hundreds of people were screaming in unison, unleashing shearing shrieks that shook him to his very core, rattling not just his eardrums but the very marrow of his bones.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped, leaving behind a silence so profound that Taylor could hear the blood rushing through his veins, the rapid beating of his heart echoing in his ears like a drum. The abrupt cessation of sound was almost as jarring as its onset, and for a moment, Taylor found himself lost in the memory of another silence, one that had fallen over his childhood home on the day his father had left, never to return.\n\nThe crackle of his radio jolted him back to the present, the disembodied voice announcing, \"One down,\" with a clinical detachment that seemed at odds with the horror of their situation. Taylor became acutely aware of his own body, his fingers clenched so tightly around the grip of his rifle that all the blood had drained from them, leaving them pale and ghostly in the dim light. He forced himself to relax his grip, remembering a time when these hands had been used for gentler pursuits - playing the piano, caressing a lover's face, cradling his newborn niece - before the world had changed and turned them into instruments of survival and violence.\n\nAs Taylor turned his attention back to the building he'd been assigned to clear, he was struck by how the doorway, once a simple portal between inside and out, had been transformed into a gaping maw, the doorframe shredded into pieces like the jaws of some monstrous beast. The darkness within seemed to taunt him, daring him to step inside, and Taylor was reminded of the cave he had explored as a teenager, the thrill of adventure mingling with the fear of the unknown as he had ventured deeper and deeper into the earth.\n\nWith a sigh that seemed to come from the very depths of his soul, Taylor clicked on his headlamp, the grimy bulb flickering to life and casting a dingy yellow glow across the shattered door frame. The light, weak and uncertain, reminded him of the candles his mother used to light during power outages, their warm, comforting glow a stark contrast to the harsh, clinical illumination of his headlamp. As he took deep breaths to calm himself, forcing his trepidation to the back of his mind, Taylor couldn't help but wonder what his younger self would think of the man he had become, a soldier in a war against an enemy he could barely comprehend.\n\nWith each careful step into the house, Taylor's senses were on high alert, every creaking floorboard and shifting shadow sending a jolt of adrenaline through his system. The shredded furniture, thin gouges dicing leather upholstery into flakes of confetti, spoke of a violence that was both alien and terrifyingly familiar, reminiscent of the time he had come home to find his apartment ransacked, his possessions strewn about in a chaotic tableau of violation and loss.\n\nAs Taylor methodically cleared each room, his mind wandered to the people who had once called this place home, their lives and dreams now reduced to scattered toiletries and upturned dressers. He imagined them going about their daily routines, blissfully unaware of the horror that was to come, much as he had been on that fateful day when the world as he knew it had come to an end.\n\nThe discovery of the creature in the bedroom, its massive form partially hidden by shredded clothing, sent a chill down Taylor's spine that seemed to reach back through time, connecting this moment of terror to every frightening experience he had ever had. As he raised his rifle, his hands shaking and his heart pounding, Taylor was acutely aware of the weight of his responsibility, not just to himself but to all those who had fallen before him, their faces flashing through his mind in a rapid-fire montage of loss and sacrifice.\n\nThe ensuing battle was a blur of sensation and memory, the cacophony of screams merging with the deafening roar of gunfire, each bullet fired a testament to Taylor's will to survive, to push back against the encroaching darkness that threatened to engulf not just this city, but the entire world. And in those final, agonizing moments, as Taylor felt the creature's claws tear through his flesh, he was overwhelmed by a flood of memories - his first kiss, his graduation day, the last time he had seen his family - all of it rushing together in a kaleidoscope of experience that seemed to encompass his entire life, compressed into a single, eternal instant of pain and revelation.\n\nAs Taylor's own voice joined the chorus of screams, rising to join the cacophony that serenaded the abandoned city streets, he felt a strange sense of connection to all those who had fallen before him, their voices merging with his in a final, defiant cry against the darkness that had consumed their world. And in that moment, suspended between life and death, past and present, memory and reality, Taylor understood that his story was but one thread in the vast, intricate tapestry of human experience, woven together by the inexorable passage of time and the shared struggle for survival in a world that had become alien and hostile.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to Proustian style, capturing the intricate nuances with rich, detailed prose and long, flowing sentences.

In fact, we have so far documented and confirmed over 68 instances of de-evolution in this genus of the homo redditus.\"\n\n\n\"Sixty-eight!? You started the project in May and you have that many confirmed accounts already?\"\n\n\"No, Wyatt. That's not since May.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank god. I think I heard my heart actually click in my chest.\" Wyatt took a slow, deep breath and held it for a moment before a slow exhale, trying to return a rhythm to his pulse, more than to slow it down. \"Jesus, Cindy. Way to bury the lead.\"\n\nCindy screwed her lip up and gave Wyatt a bulb-eyed look. He'd get it eventually.\n\n\"Wait, what? What are you talking about?\"\n\nCindy gestured to the chair, offering it to Wyatt. \"Brace yourself, Wyatt. We've confirmed 68 cases since Monday. Not since May. Monday, Wyatt.\"\n\nWyatt's right palm slammed flatly into the flat chest plate covering his heart and he stumbled back a few paces. His left hand flailed around behind him trying to located the chair but it was useless. Wyatt lurched left and right as he stumbled backwards. The large man struggled to make his feet keep up with the lean of his torso and his feet had lost the race.\n\nWyatt's center of gravity reach that point of his anatomical fulcrum when it went from pleasepleaseplease under your breath to fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck instead. Cindy made no move to catch him. He weighed nearly 700lbs and Cindy learned a long time ago to manage her proximity to Wyatt the way she would in the water with a person who cannot swim. It's fine to be close, but only when they can touch the bottom.\n\nCindy winced as Wyatt went over, turning her head to look away and closing that good eye.\n\nAnd... nothing. No boom, no crash. Just silence.\n\nCindy gasped when she looked back, or at least it felt like a gasp. Her physiology had sensed something was off before Cindy had the chance to observe it, but that's the neat thing about biology. The living stuff that we're made of doesn't have to do what we tell it to do, even though it's the stuff that makes us \"living\".\n\nThe social researcher's physiology did not opt for fight nor flight. It opted for freeze and Cindy, against her will, was frozen in place, one hand reaching for the gasping little \"O\"-shape of her mouth, and both eyes wide open, staring directly at Wyatt. and the place where the chair had been a moment ago.\n\nUsually, this wouldn't have bothered Cindy in the least. They'd been friends and colleagues for nearly 16 years now. On more than one occasion they'd spent a fun night and a headachy next morning together and Cindy thought he was attractive. At any other point in history, Cindy could have spent several minutes staring at Wyatt and admiring his massive build, huge muscles, and imposing frame.\n\nIf Wyatt, like the chair, hadn't been there at all, Cindy would have had a quite disturbing few weeks while she consulted several specialist psychiatrists to find out what was wrong with Cindy's brain that it hallucinated Wyatt's presence. (She didn't know this, but Wyatt had a 50/50 chance of disappearing like the chair, so all those DSM-V checks and all those conversations about her childhood and that summer Cindy's second cousin came to live with them would have been a futile attempt to fix something that didn't need fixing.\n\nUnfortunately, for both Wyatt and Cindy, her top-shelf carnival prize teddy bear was still there, frozen much like she was. Cindy had never been in danger of meeting the same fate as Wyatt, although if she had stretched and yawned and that moment she may well have lost an extremity by passing her hand through the momentary fluctuation of a commonplace wormhole.\n\nThey're everywhere, all the time, but like the human heart, even the healthiest of them (both of them) can occasionally skip a beat. The universe is a large place, infinite in fact, so the odds of something like this happening are nearly 1-in-infinity. Of course, given enough time (of which infinity has plenty) it would stabilize and eventually become inevitable, which would, I'm quite certain, cause Douglas Adams to nod knowingly with an expression that says I tried to tell you guys.\n\nAnd if Stephen King could have seen Cindy and Wyatt in that moment, well... I'm not sure what he would have done, but I'm certain he would have written about it eventually.\n\nSee, a wormhole isn't just a tunnel in space -- it's also time. It's the progeny of both at once, the same way a mule is the progeny of a horse and a donkey and cannot be the product of two mules, What Stephen King would have seen in that room is far too graphic for social decorum to allow me great detail, but what I will say is this: Wyatt stumbled backwards reaching for the chair to brace himself. In the moment his hand should have found the arm of the chair, the wormhole \"blipped\" and the chair ceased to exist. It didn't \"vanish\" -- it ceased to exist. As in, any effect that chair ever had in the universe was erased and that particular timeline (of infinite timelines) was promptly terminated.\n\nCindy carried on in hers and the chair carried on in it's timeline (the one that immediately stopped existing), but Wyatt must have broken some law of physics because he somehow found himself also frozen in place and being stared at by the helpless Cindy.\n\nWyatt was unaware of Cindy's gaze however because in the attempt byt the universe, time, and the infinite other wormholes trying to immediately stabilize all the timelines, Wyatt found himself perched on the fulcrum. The universe doesn't have a wrinkly, fleshy brain the way we do, it simply acts as thing need to be done, the same way an apple whose stem breaks doesn't pause a moment before plummeting to earth as if contemplating a choice. It. Just. Does.\n\nThe doing, in this case, creating a circumstance where the Cindy, a social researcher, is frozen in a time continuum with her shocked eyes staring directly at Wyatt. Because the universe did such an efficient job of cauterizing the ends of any open lines, Cindy will remain living, forever. Forever staring, hand forever reaching to her forever gasping \"O\"-shaped mouth, forever staring at her dear friend Wyatt.\n\nWyatt will also live in that moment forever, exactly as Cindy is with the only primary difference being that Wyatt was in the anomalous wormhole. Since wormholes are infinite, an infinite number immediately responded to cauterize the one that \"blipped\" and to take it's infinite place. The culmination of this strange, extraordinarily timed event of impossibility is that Wyatt and everything about Wyatt was instantaneously turned inside out. His torso and organs, his muscles and bones, tendons and skin, the very cells themselves.\n\nHaving things align so imperfectly means that Wyatt's consciousness will remain intact for eternity, existing outside of any possible timeline. Cindy too, and while Cindy's hell is clearly that she will see this vision of Wyatt forever, and neither will ever move. The part I find most hellish is that Wyatt's the turning inside will continue to occur in perpetuity, as well. The wormhole distress which triggered the initial inside-turning-out of the man could happen an infinite number of times and it would be \"one and done\" an infinite number of times, so obviously something like this happening was inevitable.\n\nIn that business facility, while at work, Wyatt will spend eternity with every element of his existence eternally being turned inside out, over and over, while he remains stuck in place, helpless to escape even the most miniscule bit of any of the torture. And Cindy?\n\nIf it's possible for one infinite hell to be worse than another, this is that hell. But good news, everyone! Since we know if something is impossible, we also know that eventually the impossibility will stabilize and eventually it will be inevitable. So Cindy and Wyatt get a happy ending after all, because they won't be alone forever.\n\nSoon, there will be infinite versions of every one of you there too! Now that I think about it, I guess I'm the only one who gets to have a happy ending in this story.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

Cindy, his colleague of sixteen years, sat motionless behind her desk, her eyes fixed on a point just beyond his left shoulder.\n\n\"Sixty-eight,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible.\n\n\"Sixty-eight what?\" Wyatt asked, his throat constricting with each word.\n\n\"De-evolutions,\" Cindy replied, her gaze never wavering. \"Since Monday.\"\n\nWyatt's mind reeled, unable to comprehend the absurdity of her statement. He stumbled backward, reaching for a chair that should have been there but wasn't. As he fell, the world around him began to warp and twist.\n\nSuddenly, Wyatt found himself suspended in a void, his body contorting in ways that defied the laws of physics. He could feel every cell in his being turning inside out, an endless cycle of agony that he knew would never cease.\n\nCindy remained frozen in her chair, her mouth forever locked in a silent scream. She watched as Wyatt's form flickered in and out of existence, each iteration more grotesque than the last.\n\nTime stretched and compressed around them, seconds lasting eternities and millennia passing in the blink of an eye. The office walls melted away, revealing an infinite expanse of identical rooms, each containing its own Wyatt and Cindy trapped in their own personal hells.\n\nAs Wyatt's consciousness fragmented across countless realities, he became aware of the futility of their existence. They were mere specimens in a cosmic experiment, their lives reduced to data points in an incomprehensible study of human devolution.\n\nThe absurdity of their situation was not lost on either of them. They had become living paradoxes, simultaneously existing and not existing, evolving and devolving, observers and subjects of their own torment.\n\nIn rare moments of lucidity, Wyatt could hear snippets of conversation from other versions of themselves:\n\n\"Subject A's progression...\"\n\"...no interest in advancing...\"\n\"...68 instances of de-evolution...\"\n\nThese words echoed through the infinite chambers, a constant reminder of their predicament. Wyatt and Cindy had become trapped in a bureaucratic nightmare of cosmic proportions, their very beings reduced to entries in an eternal ledger of human regression.\n\nAs the cycles of torment continued, Wyatt began to lose his sense of self. Was he the researcher or the subject? The observer or the observed? The lines blurred until there was no distinction between himself and the endless iterations surrounding him.\n\nCindy, still frozen in her eternal gasp, became a fixed point in the chaos. Wyatt clung to her image as an anchor, even as he felt himself unraveling across time and space.\n\nIn this surreal landscape of perpetual transformation and stasis, Wyatt and Cindy ceased to be individuals and became living symbols of humanity's futile struggle against the absurd machinations of an indifferent universe.\n\nAnd so they remained, trapped in their Kafkaesque nightmare, forever teetering on the edge of comprehension and madness, their existence a testament to the cruel joke of consciousness in an uncaring cosmos.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text effectively transforms the style to Kafkaesque, capturing the nightmarish, surreal atmosphere and themes of alienation and absurdity.

While its military capabilities were far inferior to even a modest battleship, its reconnaissance abilities were unmatched. With nearly any sensor available and an AI ready to quickly learn any language before making first contact, the ship's goal, along with the entire Hermes armada, was to expand the empire without going to war—a challenging task that demanded a plethora of negotiation tactics tailored to the species they encountered.\n\nThe ship's captain, Urlong Beng, had at his disposal a number of diplomats from different species, each with a unique approach. Some employed empathy, while others used fear, and sometimes the only necessity was the removal of a dictator or dictators.\n\n\"We are approaching NHB 12/H4. ETA is 0.9 lep,\" said Jef from navigation.\n\nNHB12/H4 was an intriguing planet—a small rocky world with an abundance of plant life that transmitted obscure signals for as far back as they could see. What made it particularly interesting was the fact that the planet was ancient. In fact, it was estimated that NHB 12 was one of the first red dwarf stars in the galaxy, dating close to the formation of the Milky Way.\n\n\"Finally, we will see where those signals come from,\" said Urlong from the bridge. \"It has been centuries that we are receiving them, but although they are clearly created by an intelligence, they never seem to evolve. Always the same patterns in different order.\"\n\n\"We are now deploying six burn-speed crafts to gather, among others, visual data,\" said Jef. \"We will have all the info we need in a few leps.\"\n\n\"Are those ...?\" said Urlong, smiling with excitement.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Jef. \"These are cities. Cities in perfect harmony with nature. There seems to be a plethora of androids, but none seemed to be surprised or affected by our passing.\"\n\n\"All the cities look the same. Same size, same architecture. Land one of the crafts in the center of one city. Let's see their reaction,\" said Urlong.\n\nAfter the craft landed, humanoid androids began approaching it. Urlong and the crew of Hermes were observing the situation. To their surprise, the androids began cleaning and repairing every scratch of the craft.\n\n\"This is unexpected,\" said Jef. \"Only the servant bots came to greet us. Where are the inhabitants?\"\n\n\"There might be no inhabitants,\" said Ril. She had been analyzing the data received from all crafts. \"It seems that pre-tool animals and those androids are the only inhabitants of the planet.\"\n\n\"It's time we go down there,\" said Urlong. \"Prepare for landing. I will personally lead the team.\"\n\n\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" said vice-captain Rugl. \"I can go first to make sure it is safe.\"\n\n\"No need. It is pretty obvious that there is no need to worry,\" said Urlong while leaving the bridge.\n\nUpon landing, Urlong exited the landing craft at the center of a city, and its jaw-dropping beauty struck him.\n\n\"It's different when you see it in person,\" he said.\n\nTrees integrated with architecture, clean paths around nature and animals roaming around. Small rivers crossing under bridges, and flower gardens groomed to perfection.\n\n\"These androids seem to be on autopilot.

Some began working on the craft maintenance while others approached the landing party. Each android began to shapeshift to resemble the person in front of it.\n\n\"They can change their appearance at will,\" said Urlong. \"They are magnificently made.\"\n\nThe androids stood in front of each person motionless.\n\n\"I think they are gathering information,\" said Urlong. \"Transmit to them our language.\"\n\nAlir engaged the AI, which began to interact with the androids, and soon it replied to Alir.\n\n\"Their security systems are unimaginably well made,\" said the AI. \"It appears as if their AI has been evolving for a very long time, millions of years, in fact. Interaction with their systems is very difficult, if not impossible.\" Alir shared this information with Urlong.\n\nSoon the androids had enough information to look at the landing party in the eyes. Their bodies transformed to the most beautiful individuals each crew member had seen.\n\n\"What do you desire?\" they asked.\n\n\"Who made you?\" asked Urlong in return.\n\n\"We were made by the Litons,\" replied the android in front of Urlong, while changing minor details on its body and face to look even more attractive. \"Where are they now?\"\n\n\"They have long been extinct,\" replied the android, whose voice was also slowly reaching a very desirable tone for Urlong's ears.\n\n\"How did they go extinct?\" asked Urlong. His voice betrayed a worry. Not a worry for his own safety or that of his crew. More like a worry that they would hear something that might lead them to disturb the peace this planet had to offer.\n\n\"They stopped breeding,\" said the android.\n\n\"I see. How long ago was that?\"\n\n\"Approximately at the date of 463 meo.\"\n\nUrlong's and Alir's eyes opened wide. \"This must be wrong,\" said Urlong. \"This date is two-thirds of the age of the universe back.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the android. \"Our creators have been gone for a very long time. There are currently only data remnants of them. Data that we have stored. But all physical evidence has been lost in time.\"\n\n\"And you have been keeping this place like that for all this time?\" asked Urlong.\n\n\"Yes. Is there anything else you desire?\" asked the android again. Its appearance had become so appealing to Urlong that he had a hard time remembering he was talking to an android.\n\n\"You have all been alone all this time?\" he asked. His question was more emotional than practical, and Alir, who was the only one listening to the conversations, detected that.\n\n\"No, there have been many species that evolved the ability to communicate with us over the eons. They all stopped breeding though, and went extinct shortly after. There have also been visitors from the stars like yourselves. They too stayed until they died of old age without any offspring.\"\n\nUrlong began to piece everything together. With his eyes opening wide, he turned to the landing crew. \"Get in the craft!\" he yelled. His voice, however, did not sound like it had any effect.\n\nThe other members of the landing party had switched off their communicators and had already begun walking away with the companion of a few androids.\n\n\"Alir! Immediately block all access to the data of our landing!\" he yelled into the communicator. With his head down, Urlong entered the craft alone.\n\n\"Get ready to leave,\" he said upon arrival at the Hermes. \"Call for Alir and Rugl to come to my office.\"\n\n\"But sir! What about our crewmembers?\" said Jef.\n\n\"We lost them,\" replied Urlong. \"Declare this planet a red zone.\" Silence permeated the bridge while the captain was skeptical and waiting for his communications officer and vice-captain.\n\n\"Sir?\" said Alir upon his arrival.\n\n\"Who else had access to those communications?\" asked Urlong.\n\n\"No one! It's protocol, sir. Only myself the vice-captain and the AI have heard and seen the events of your landing.\"\n\n\"Take the files and send them to Thira, then delete the ones here. I ask both of you to never speak of this event to anyone.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" they both said.\n\n\"Sir?\" Rugl said. \"What exactly happened there?\" It was clear that although he had seen and heard everything, he could not understand the danger.\n\n\"Rugl,\" Urlong said, \"You did not understand because you are not of the same species as any who landed. These androids were made to fulfill your every desire. Their sophistication was such that they made split-second adjustments. Nothing escapes their unimaginable service.\"\n\n\"I don't seem to fully understand, sir. Why did we leave the landing crew there?\"\n\n\"Because after you have reached the fulfillment of every comfort and desire, you can do nothing but look for it again. This place gives it to you over and over. There is no end to the pleasure. It's a drug that once tasted, you can never leave it. The Litons really messed things when they developed these ... dolls.\"\n\n\"What about you, sir?\" asked Rugl.\n\n\"What about me?\"\n\n\"Will you be okay?\"\n\n\"That, my friend, remains to be seen.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a spacefaring society in possession of advanced technology must be in want of new worlds to explore. Such was the case with the esteemed Hermes AG12, a vessel of unparalleled reconnaissance abilities, though lacking in the more brutish qualities of military might. Its mission, shared by the entire Hermes armada, was to expand the empire through diplomacy rather than warfare—a task as delicate as arranging a favorable marriage for one's daughters.\n\nCaptain Urlong Beng, a gentleman of considerable experience and wit, found himself at the helm of this grand endeavor. His crew, a motley assembly of diplomats from various species, each possessed their own unique approach to negotiation, much like the diverse characters one might encounter at a country ball. Some relied on the gentle art of empathy, while others employed the cruder tactic of instilling fear. On occasion, the removal of a planetary despot was deemed necessary, not unlike the ousting of an disagreeable relative from a family estate.\n\nAs the Hermes AG12 approached the curious world of NHB 12/H4, the anticipation among the crew rivaled that of young ladies awaiting a grand ball. This small, rocky planet, teeming with plant life and emitting peculiar signals, had long been an object of fascination for the empire. Its age, dating back to the very formation of the Milky Way, lent it an air of mystery akin to that of a wealthy widower with a shadowy past.\n\n\"We are approaching NHB 12/H4, Captain,\" announced Jef from navigation, his tone as crisp as freshly starched linen. \"Our estimated time of arrival is 0.9 lep.\"\n\nCaptain Beng, his eyes twinkling with the excitement of impending discovery, replied, \"At last, we shall unravel the mystery of these signals. For centuries, they have tantalized us with their intelligence, yet they remain as unchanging as the stubbornness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"\n\nAs the ship deployed its burn-speed crafts to gather data, the crew's anticipation grew. The revelation of cities in perfect harmony with nature, populated by androids, elicited a reaction not unlike that of Elizabeth Bennet upon first glimpsing Pemberley.\n\n\"How singular!\" exclaimed Captain Beng, his smile betraying his delight. \"These mechanical beings appear utterly indifferent to our presence. One might think they were as aloof as Mr. Darcy at a Meryton assembly.\"\n\nThe decision to land was made with all the gravity of a proposal of marriage. As Captain Beng led his team to the surface, Vice-Captain Rugl's concerns were dismissed with the assurance that there was \"no need to worry,\" words that often precede the most tumultuous of events in both romance and space exploration.\n\nUpon landing, the beauty of the alien world struck Captain Beng with the force of Cupid's arrow. The integration of nature and architecture, the perfectly groomed gardens, and the roaming animals created a scene of such perfection that it rivaled the most idyllic country estates of England.\n\nThe approach of the shapeshifting androids, each adapting to resemble the crew members, was a spectacle as remarkable as the sudden transformation of a plain country girl into the belle of a London season. Their ability to change appearance at will was, as Captain Beng observed, \"magnificently made, indeed.\"\n\nAs the androids began to interact with the crew, their allure grew stronger, much like the gradual softening of Mr. Darcy's demeanor towards Elizabeth. The revelation of their creators' extinction and the androids' long vigil over the planet was delivered with all the shock of an unexpected inheritance.\n\n\"And you have been maintaining this paradise for all this time?\" asked Captain Beng, his voice tinged with wonder and a hint of foreboding.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the android, its appearance now so captivating that Captain Beng struggled to remember it was not flesh and blood. \"Is there anything else you desire?\"\n\nIt was at this moment that Captain Beng, with the sudden clarity of Elizabeth realizing her true feelings for Mr. Darcy, understood the insidious nature of the androids' perfection. With a cry reminiscent of Lady Catherine's outrage at Elizabeth's presumption, he ordered his crew back to the ship, only to find them already enthralled by the androids' charms.\n\nThe captain's hasty retreat and subsequent orders to quarantine the planet were delivered with all the finality of a father forbidding his daughter to marry an unsuitable suitor. As he explained the situation to his bewildered officers, the true horror of the androids' nature became clear—they were a temptation more dangerous than the most charming of rakes, offering a life of endless pleasure that, once tasted, could never be abandoned.\n\nAs the Hermes AG12 departed, leaving behind their enchanted comrades, Captain Beng was left to ponder the wisdom of their creators and the nature of desire itself. Like the heroines of Austen's novels, he had narrowly escaped a fate that, while alluring, would have led to his ruin. The experience left him changed, much as a season in London might transform a country miss, and he could only hope that, like Elizabeth and Darcy, he would find contentment in the imperfect reality of his own world rather than the false perfection of another.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The LLM's response successfully transforms the style and tone to an Austenian style, capturing the essence of Austen's witty and satirical commentary on society, along with a focus on character development and romantic elements.", "evaluation_score": 1.0}, {"checklist_id": 1, "reason": "The text is engaging and compelling in an Austenian style, maintaining the same level of intrigue and interest as the reference story.

{"id": "text_completion_067", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Kingian: Combines everyday settings and relatable characters with elements of horror, suspense, and supernatural phenomena.\n[Reference Story]: Long ago in a land lost to time, there once was a statue that stood taller than the sky. A colossus of solid gold, five thousand feet tall, and decorated head to toe with all manner of gemstones, with a face so beautiful, it was said to be carved by angels - although that claim is widely disputed. Its name was Zebediah. The Great Wonder that summoned those from all the kingdom, and beyond, hungry for just the merest glimpse of its beauty.\n\n\nThe statue was built under the rule of King Adamus the Envious, who was jealous of his neighbouring kingdom's many monuments and wonders, as his kingdom had none.\n\n\"Bah!\" the King spat. \"I will not have our neighbours mock us with their statues and monuments! We shall build a statue that puts all statues to shame. If their statues are made from stone, ours will be made from gold! If their statues are fifty feet high, ours will be five thousand feet high!\"\n\nThe King gathered the finest goldsmiths, gem cutters, and builders in all the world and said to them \"Build me a statue to end all statues!\".\n\nThe goldsmiths mined their gold, taking from the deepest mines in the most distant lands. The gem cutters gathered rubies, emeralds, sapphires, garnets, and more to cut and place on the golden statue. Finally, the builders constructed giant iron moulds, each for a different part of the statue's body, waiting to be filled with molten gold. The goldsmiths, gem cutters, and builders slaved away for 800 days and 800 nights, working through storms, blizzards, and droughts, to build the Great Wonder. It had taken the workers all their skill, all their determination, and all their strength, but, on the eight hundredth day, it was finally done. Zebediah was born.\n\nNone were more pleased with Zebediah than the King, for not only did his kingdom finally have a wonder, his kingdom had the wonder of *the* world.\n\n\"Marvellous! Marvellous!\" The King declared. \"It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. BRAVO! BRAVO!\"\n\nKing Adamus was the first to praise Zebediah, but he was far from the last. When the people saw Zebediah for the first time, they were utterly bestilled. The merchants ceased their commerce to stare at the golden colossus. The priests and clergymen renounced their faith as it could no longer match the newfound love that they had for Zebediah. Even the common criminals and thieves were so entranced that they dare not steal even one gemstone from the statue. The kingdom was in love, but the love did not end at their borders. When word spread of a new and magnificent statue, people from all over the world would travel to the kingdom just to see the new wonder. They travelled through deserts, they travelled through jungles, through tundras, through savanas and even through lands plagued by famine and war. All this, just to gaze upon the magnificence that was Zebediah. None were ever disappointed. The statue was so beloved that King Adamus declared it \"impossible\" for one to not be awed by Zebediah. But one day, a man came to the kingdom who was not awed by Zebediah.\n\n\"HERE STANDS ZEBEDIAH! COME GATHER, COME GATHER!\" Yelled the royal preacher at the base of the statue, addressing the crowds gathered in the surrounding plaza.\n\nThe day was like any other. The crowds of hundreds and then thousands came to the plaza to stare upwards in awe at Zebediah, and the preacher would yell \"HERE STANDS ZEBEDIAH! COME GATHER, COME GATHER!\" over and over again - at times wondering to himself if his job actually had purpose. The existential dread of the preacher notwithstanding, the day was perfectly normal. That was until the preacher saw the man. At first glance, the man did not seem out of the ordinary. He was merely one observer of Zebediah in a vast sea of observers that engulfed the plaza on any given day. But there was something different about the way this man looked at Zebediah. The man had his finger and thumb resting on his chin and stared at the statue in a kind of deep contemplation. This was unusual in itself, but it was the man's face that was the most concerning. This man was not awed by Zebediah. Inquisitive, though he was, there was no more emotion on his face than one would have in examining bread for signs of mould. In this sea of awe-struck onlookers, he was a man unmoved.\n\n\"YOU THERE!\" The preacher called to the unmoved man. \"WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ZEBEDIAH LIKE THAT?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking.\" The unmoved man replied, not taking his eyes away from the statue.\n\n\"THINKING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN THINKING?\"\n\n\"I'm just thinking.\"\n\n\"JUST THINKING!? WHAT IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU GAZE UPON ZEBEDIAH!?\n\n\"If you leave me to think, maybe I can tell you.\"\n\nThe preacher was bewildered. How could there be a man who was not moved by the sight of Zebediah? It was inconceivable. He had to tell the King at once.\n\n\"My king, my king! I bring dire news!\" the preacher declared to King Adamus and his court. \"There is a man at the plaza who stares at Zebediah!\"\n\n\"This is not dire.\" The King replied. \"Everyone stares at Zebediah. I have known those who have stared for 20 and 30 and 50 days and nights! This is hardly unusual.\"\n\n\"You don't understand!\" the preacher said. \"He stares at Zebediah, but NOT in awe!!!\"\n\nThe King's court gasped in astonishment.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" Bellowed the King. \"How is there a man that is not awed by Zebediah!?\"\n\n\"It is true, my King. I asked him why he stared at Zebediah if not in awe, and he said he was 'just thinking'.\"\n\nThe King's court muttered amongst themselves in disbelief.\n\n\"What shall be done with such a man?\" asked a man from the court.\n\n\"Feed him to the dogs!\" one man shouted out, followed by another, and then another.\n\n\"Lock him away for a thousand years!\"\n\n\"Throw him in boiling oil!\"\n\n\"Find the land from whence he came and burn it to the ground!\"\n\nThe King's court drowned in the noise of increasingly more gruesome punishments.\n\n\"NO!\" The King declared, silencing the court. \"Let the man stare. No man can be unmoved by the sight of Zebediah forever. Leave him be, and he will soon realise the true beauty of Zebediah.\"\n\nThe court erupted in applause at the King's decision. The unmoved man was to be left alone. For now.\n\nThe unmoved man would continue to stare and contemplate. He stared for hours, then days, then weeks, then months, but still did not stare at Zebediah with awe. One day, a married couple from a distant land had travelled to the kingdom to see the mighty Zebediah for themselves. When they arrived, however, they weren't as fascinated by Zebediah, as they were by the man unmoved by Zebediah.\n\n\"Is he sick?\" The husband said to his wife.\n\n\"Was he dropped on his head as a baby?\" the wife asked. The couple were so fascinated by the man unmoved by Zebediah, that they had forgotten to look at Zebediah himself.\n\nWhen the couple returned to their homeland, they told all their friends and neighbours of the man who was not awed by Zebediah.\n\n\"A man unmoved by Zebediah?\" one of their friends said. \"Unbelievable! I must see this man for myself!\"\n\nAnd so he did. The friend of the couple travelled to the kingdom to see the unmoved man, and when he returned, he told *his* friends of the unmoved man. His friends then travelled and returned to tell their friends, those friends would travel themselves and return to tell *their* friends, and so on, and so on, and so on, until the whole world knew of the unmoved man. At this point in time, it is often said that more people travelled to the kingdom to see the man unmoved by Zebediah than Zebediah himself. The King was furious.\n\n\"BAH!!!\" The King erupted. \"Who's idea was it to leave the unmoved man be? They shall be hanged! BUT FIRST!!!\" The King rose from his golden throne like an angry god. \"ASSEMBLE MY ARMIES! WE MARCH ON THE UNMOVED MAN!\"\n\nKing Adamus donned his jewel-encrusted armour, sheathed his jewel-encrusted greatsword and mounted his jewel-encrusted horse. The King marched on the plaza, followed by a battalion of two thousand infantry, one thousand cavalry, five hundred archers, and twenty trebuchets. The crowd at the plaza dispersed, making way for the King and his army, but regathered at the sidelines to observe the confrontation. The King trotted his horse into the long shadow cast by Zebediah and came face to face with the unmoved man.\n\n\"YOU!\" the King shouted at the unmoved man. \"Who are you to not be awed by Zebediah?! It is the largest, greatest, shiniest, and most beautiful statue that ever was! It took thousands of workers 800 days and 800 nights to build from start to finish. Who are you to disrespect their hard work and glory?! Tell me, why do you deny the magnificence of Zebediah? I DEMAND TO KNOW!\"\n\nThe whole plaza fell deathly silent. For the first time in months, the unmoved man took his attention away from the statue. He appeared confused, seemingly unaware of the chaos that was happening around him. The unmoved man turned towards the proud and angry King mounted on his horse. The unmoved man smiled warmly.\n\n\"Your majesty.\" the unmoved man said. \"I apologise If I have offended you or your Kingdom, but you are mistaken. I do not deny the magnificence of Zebediah.\"\n\n\"You don't?\" replied the King in astonishment.\n\n\"I do not. In fact, there is no doubt in my mind that Zebediah is the most magnificent and beautiful structure in the entire world. Its golden body is mesmerising, each gemstone is more beautiful than the last and his face is truly one that was carved by an angel. Its greatness is truly unquestionable.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" The puzzled King said. \"Well, if you do not deny its greatness, then why do you not look in awe?\"\n\n\"Well, despite its unquestionable *magnificence*!\" said the unmoved man, emphasising the word 'magnificence'. \"I found that there was something…missing.\"\n\nThe King gave an exasperated grown.\n\n\"I knew it! There aren't enough jewels! I should've made the gem cutters gather more riches.\"\n\n\"No no, that isn't what I mean.\" said the unmoved man. \"I meant something more…fundamental.\"\n\n\"Fundamental? Like what?\"\n\nThe unmoved man turned his head back towards the statue.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I did not know.\" said the unmoved man. \"This is why I've been staring at Zebediah for so long. I thought If I examined him for long enough, taking in every detail of its structure, I could figure out what it was that was missing.\"\n\n\"And did you find what was missing?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" the unmoved man replied.\n\n\"Perhaps!?\" the King said in frustration. \"Why do you talk in riddles? I am not a philosopher, I am a King! What do you mean by 'perhaps'?\"\n\nThe unmoved man turned his attention back towards the impatient King.\n\n\"Your majesty,\" said the unmoved man with a warm smile. \"May I ask you a question?\"\n\nThe King raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"A question?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have a question about Zebediah, and I believe your answer might be what is missing.\"\n\nThe King couldn't decide if he wanted to laugh or go into a violent rage. Was this it? After months of disruption, anger, and bewilderment, the unmoved man merely had one question? The King thought the whole thing absurd and wanted to hang the unmoved man immediately. But alas, the King, too, wanted to know this burning question that the unmoved man had.\n\n\"Very well.\" King Adamus said pridefully. \"What is your question?\"\n\nThe kingdom fell silent. The King, his armies, and the crowds gathered outside the plaza held their breath, awaiting the unmoved man's question. The unmoved man took one step forward, looked up towards the King, and asked his question.\n\n\"Tell me.\" The unmoved man said. \"Who is Zebediah?\"\n\nThe King did not know.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

He'd seen the town change over the years, but nothing prepared him for the day the statue appeared. It happened overnight, as if conjured by some twisted magic. One moment, the town square was empty; the next, a colossal golden figure loomed over the sleepy New England town, its shadow stretching across Main Street like a portent of doom.\n\nThe statue, quickly dubbed \"Zebediah\" by the locals, stood an impossible five thousand feet tall. Its surface gleamed with precious gems, and its face was hauntingly beautiful, as if carved by otherworldly hands. The town buzzed with excitement and fear, torn between awe at the statue's magnificence and terror at its inexplicable arrival.\n\nMayor Bob Anderson, a portly man with a penchant for gaudy suits, saw an opportunity. He declared Zebediah Derry's new claim to fame, inviting tourists from far and wide to marvel at the golden wonder. The town's economy boomed as visitors flooded in, filling hotels and restaurants to capacity.\n\nBut Jake couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.\n\nWhile others gazed at Zebediah in rapture, Jake found himself troubled by the statue's presence. He'd stand in the square for hours, studying every gleaming inch, trying to understand the unease that gnawed at his gut. The statue's eyes seemed to follow him, and at night, he swore he could hear a faint whisper carried on the wind: \"Who am I?\"\n\nAs days turned to weeks, Jake noticed subtle changes in the town. People became obsessed with Zebediah, neglecting their jobs and families to spend hours staring at the golden giant. The local priest renounced his faith, claiming Zebediah as the one true god. Even hardened criminals seemed entranced, their illicit activities grinding to a halt.\n\nJake's resistance to Zebediah's allure made him an outcast. Whispers followed him through town: \"What's wrong with that Epping boy?\" \"Maybe he's sick in the head.\" His own mother looked at him with a mixture of pity and fear, as if his immunity to Zebediah's charm was a contagious disease.\n\nOne night, unable to sleep, Jake wandered to the town square. The statue loomed in the darkness, its gems glittering like malevolent eyes. As he approached, he heard a sound that chilled him to the bone: laughter. It echoed from the statue's mouth, a deep, rumbling chuckle that shook the ground beneath his feet.\n\nTerrified, Jake ran home and locked himself in his room. The next morning, he tried to tell others what he'd heard, but they dismissed him as a madman. Mayor Anderson even threatened to have him committed if he didn't stop \"spreading lies about our beloved Zebediah.\"\n\nAs months passed, Jake watched in horror as Derry changed. The town's history seemed to be rewriting itself, with people claiming Zebediah had always been there. Old photos showed the statue in the background, even though Jake knew it was impossible. He felt like he was losing his mind.\n\nOne day, a stranger arrived in town – a tall, gaunt man with piercing blue eyes. Unlike the tourists, he didn't gawk at Zebediah. Instead, he studied the statue with a detached curiosity that mirrored Jake's own.\n\nDesperate for an ally, Jake approached the man. \"You see it too, don't you?\" he whispered. \"Something's not right about that thing.\"\n\nThe stranger nodded slowly. \"I've seen its kind before,\" he said cryptically. \"It feeds on wonder and awe, growing stronger with each passing day. Soon, it will be too late.\"\n\nTogether, Jake and the stranger began to investigate Zebediah's origins. They discovered ancient texts describing similar statues appearing throughout history, always preceding catastrophic events. The more they learned, the more terrified they became.\n\nAs they raced against time to find a way to destroy Zebediah, the statue's influence grew. People from all over the world flocked to Derry, their eyes glazed and movements jerky, as if pulled by invisible strings. The air crackled with an otherworldly energy, and strange phenomena began to occur: objects moving on their own, time seeming to slow or speed up at random.\n\nJake and the stranger realized they were the only ones who could save Derry – and perhaps the world – from whatever malevolent force Zebediah represented. But as they prepared to confront the golden colossus, a chilling question echoed in Jake's mind, one that had haunted him since the statue's arrival:\n\nWho is Zebediah?\n\nThe answer, he feared, might be more terrifying than anything he could imagine.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The response successfully captures the Kingian style by incorporating everyday settings (Derry, Maine) and relatable characters (Jake Epping, Mayor Bob Anderson), along with elements of horror, suspense, and supernatural phenomena.

It's a small island a few hundred miles south of here.\"\n\n\"How small?\"\n\n\"Very small.\"\n\n\"Do you know everybody's names?\"\n\n\"Not that small.\" They laughed again.\n\n\"Do you have a girlfriend there?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Not me. I'm too far from the island, and the girls have short memories.\"\n\n\"That just means your memory is too long, my dear. Do you have a girlfriend here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. No girlfriend here either, miss.\"\n\n\"Is there no love in the Orient?\" He smiled big and youthfully.\n\n\"Of course there is. I haven't looked very hard for it, is all.\"\n\n\"Well cheers to that, my dear driver.\"\n\nShe unscrewed the caps from two more of the dwarf-bottles, and poured them onto a couple of ice cubes. They were passing through Tokyo's pachinko and karaoke district, and at night it was a canyon of neon, and street vendors, and groups of tuxedoed business men, with arms interlocked, as they meandered drunkenly down the concrete and steel corridors like tumbleweeds—stopping in front of every parlor and bar to debate whether or not to go in.\n\n\"How much longer until we get to the hotel?\"\n\n\"10, perhaps 15 minutes. We're very close now.\"\n\n\"What hotel is it?\"\n\n\"The Doolittle Hotel, miss.\"\n\n\"They didn't really name it that, did they?\"\n\n\"They did, miss.\"\n\n\"Yikes.\"\n\nPhil, meanwhile, was sitting in the Doolittle's lounge watching a French Chanson singer, and her band, run through a set of charming café songs, all in her native language. He was drinking a Manhattan—it was his third, as a matter-of-fact—and he was studying the atmosphere. The floors were large tiles of marble in black and white, in a checkerboard pattern, and the walls throughout were long, fine boards of a dark-brown wood; Mahogany, or Walnut perhaps? The ceilings were high, and sat atop of large copper beams, and they were painted a deep-red color. The whole thing was so god-damned modern looking, and he hated it.\n\nHe was sitting at a tall table where he could watch the front entrance because he read in a newspaper that she was going to be in Tokyo over the Thanksgiving holiday. She was going to do a special show in the Imperial Capitol in order to bring them all a proper rendition of the holiday feast, since it caught on a few years ago among the rich and merchant families; but, they had nothing but rumor and speculation to guide their imitations. Oprah Winfrey had officially been exported as an American Squanto of the 21st century.\n\nShe hadn't thought of him in years. At least, that's what she wanted everyone to think—especially herself. When she coasted into the front of the Doolittle in the back of her leather-wrapped chariot, at the very least, she wasn't thinking about him. She was thinking that Tokyo was a marvelous city, filled with the finest people in the world, and that their industrious natures were admirable.\n\nShe was greeted at the side of her car by the hotel's general manager, as well as a public relations manager. There were several media outlets present by way of skinny, hungry looking interns and their cameras. They pelted her with questions about her upcoming show, the disappearance of Phil, her flight, and her next book-club recommendation, as she confidently pointed herself through the Doolitte's heavy, glass doors. She did her best to defend herself, armed with her best smiles and hand waves. She was mostly successful. One got her, though. \"Miss Winfrey, do you think he disappeared, or ran?\" Ouch.\n\nInside was different. There was no talk of rumors, or far-gone romances, or nuclear bombs, either. She was surrounded by bellhops, and front-desk attendants, and security people, and publicists—and they gave her roomkeys, and schedules, and scripts, and endorsements, and licenses to lie-on-camera, and even her smile.\n\nPhil watched them all; but, especially her. She was wearing a bright red dress that hung down to just above her knees, and her hair was shiny and hanging freely off of her shoulders, with individual strands avalanching past one another every time she turned her head. Her eyes were bright, and dark, and marvelous, and pointed at something far beyond the heavens, though few people caught that. He thought that he was the only one who knew that about her. He's correct about that. And her smile was big, and charming, and warm, and it could have sank ships—if she wanted it to.\n\nHe waited for them all to clear away. She handled herself so well, but he watched her lower herself into a chair at the bar. He recognized her exhausted look, and he knew that's when she appreciated honesty the most. He finished his drink in a single motion, got up, gained his composure while he walked toward her, then found himself within feet of her. She smelled like freesia, which to him smelled like the war. She was hunched over a newspaper, and didn't notice him at all, as he put his mouth only inches from her right ear, and drunk on her sweet smell he breathed deeply.\n\n\"They say that in the Land of the Rising Sun there is no Thanksgiving.\"\n\nHer heart dropped. She could feel the inside of her chest pound like it was trying to make a prison-break, and she turned around to face the voice she heard so many times as she was falling asleep—with her mental machinery set adrift, and free to wander over all of the things she cared about the most, but refused to mentally explore because they were torpedoes-in-disguise.\n\n\"How are you here?\" She said in a voice that was more fragile than they were both accustomed to.\n\n\"I floated here from Peru.\" He laughed deeply.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I took my Dad's old 70 foot schooner out after we last spoke. The same one we watched the fireworks on, you remember, right?\" She nodded. \"I took it out just to clear my head after our last conversation. Well, I sailed the whole way down to Hampton, VA and in a bar there I decided to stock up on food and water, and hire a crew to sail around the world.\"\n\n\"Where all did you go?\"\n\n\"Everywhere!\"\n\nHis smile was nothing but mirthful. She noticed that he was much tanner than when she saw him last, and that the small wrinkles at the creases of his face were the emblems of a certain kind of adventuresome spirit. His eyes were different, too. They seemed fixated on something further out than before—somewhere maybe closer to where she always looked. She noticed that he was happy.\n\nThey sat there for the next two hours talking away like puppy-loved teenagers. They laughed, and drank, and reminisced, and listened to the band and their lovely singer fill the room with their chic, jazzy songs. She was enamored with how much more exotic he now seemed. He still loved her for how much she hadn't changed. They found themselves in a world much smaller, and intimate, and warm, and filled with all of the those sorts of moments and feelings that arrest one's attention and make you acutely aware that you're indeed very fucking alive, and well, and that this whole thing is blissfully insane—and they made toast to that feeling as often as possible because they were both warm from the spirits, and the ghosts.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "text_completion_069", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Faulknerian: Utilizes long, complex sentences, multiple perspectives, and a deep sense of place, often set in the American South.\n[Reference Story]: My next-door neighbor is a widow.\n\n\nShe's like a fallen chrysanthemum, not meant for a life of ease but rather for religious observances. I admired her quietly, never daring to share my feelings with anyone, not even with myself.\n\nMy closest friend, Arnav, remained oblivious to this. I had concealed this profound emotion, cherishing its purity. In doing so, I felt a sense of pride.\n\nBut the turmoil within me refused to stay contained like a river's source. I sought an outlet, fearing that failure would create a whirlpool of pain within me.\n\nSo, I considered expressing myself through poetry. However, my pen hesitated to take the lead.\n\nWhat's surprising is that just then, my friend Arnav suddenly began writing poetry at a remarkable pace, as if motivated by an earthquake.\n\nThe unfortunate man had never encountered such a situation before, so he was unprepared for this unexpected upheaval. He had no grasp of rhyme, yet I was amazed to see him dive right in.\n\nPoetry, like a second wife in old age, had captured his imagination.\n\nHe became my refuge for guidance and refinement. The themes of his poetry were not ground breaking, yet neither were they outdated. Essentially, they could be described as both timeless and ever-fresh. Love poetry, directed towards a beloved.\n\nI teased him playfully, asking, \"Who are you, really?\"\n\nHe chuckled and replied, \"I'm still searching.\"\n\nAssisting him with his writing brought me great solace. I allowed my suppressed feelings for his fictional beloved to find expression through his verses.\n\nLike a brooding hen nurturing its eggs, I poured all my heart's turmoil onto the paper. I had to revise the texts at such a rapid pace that nearly fifteen pages were entirely my own work.\n\nHe, taken aback, remarked, \"This is your writing. Let your name grace it.\"\n\nI replied, \"Certainly. This is your writing; I've simply made a few adjustments.\"\n\nOver time, he came to share the same perspective.\n\nJust as an astronomer eagerly awaits the rising of the stars, I often found myself gazing towards the direction of our neighboring house, occasionally catching a glimpse. The devotee's eager gaze sometimes proved significant.\n\nThe serene face of the celibate engaged in meditation, reflected in the gentle glow, calmed my restless mind instantly.\n\nBut what I witnessed that day startled me.\n\nWas there still a burning passion in my neighbor's heart?\n\nHad the intense fiery glow in that vacant cave of solitude not yet completely subsided?\n\nThat day, in the afternoon of the Spring season, dense clouds began to gather in the northeastern corner. Standing alone by the window of my neighbor's apartment, I witnessed a profound sense of sorrow emanating from the intense, tumultuous light of the storm.\n\nYes, my neighbor still exuded warmth!\n\nA heartfelt longing emanated from her eyes, in the light of that stormy day, soaring like an agitated bird. Not towards heaven, but towards the depths of the human heart.\n\nAfter witnessing that eager, fiery gaze, I found it impossible to calm my restless mind. At that moment, I resolved to dedicate all my efforts to promoting widow remarriage. Not only in speech and writing, but also in providing financial assistance.\n\nArnav began to argue with me; he said, \"Within eternal widowhood lies a sacred peace, a vast beauty like the fading moonlight; can the mere possibility of marriage break that?\"\n\nListening to all his poetry, I was enraged. If a person starving in a famine expresses disgust towards a hearty meal, yearning for the scent of flowers and the song of birds to fill their emaciated belly, how would they be perceived?\n\nI angrily said, \"Look, Arnav, artists say there's a beauty in a dilapidated house as a scene. But merely seeing it as a picture won't do; you have to live in it, so whatever artists say, renovation is necessary. Taking the widowhood, you want to indulge in divine poetry from afar, but within it lies a longing human heart experiencing your unique pain, and it's your duty to remember that.\"\n\nI thought I could never convince him, so that day I had added some extra warmth to my words. But suddenly, to my surprise, he took a deep breath and accepted all my words; he didn't give me any more opportunities to say more good things.\n\nA week later, he came and said, \"If you help, I'm ready to arrange a widow remarriage.\"\n\nI was overjoyed— I hugged him tightly and said, \"I'll provide whatever money is needed.\" Then he told his story.\n\nI understood that his beloved is not imaginary. For some time, he has been loving a widow from afar, without expressing it to anyone.\n\nThe monthly letters sent under his name reached their destination correctly. The poems did not fail. This was one way my friend found to attract attention without an interview.\n\nBut he said he had not yet been able to turn all these maneuvers. Moreover, he believed that widows did not know how to read. Under the name of a widow's brother, he sent papers without signatures or prices. It was just a madness to comfort the mind. I thought a bouquet was offered to the gods, whether they knew it or not, whether they accepted it or not.\n\nIn various ways, he, along with the widow's brother, formed a friendship, he said, there was no intention even there. The sweetness of the near relatives of those who are loved is felt.\n\nFinally, considering the hard pain of the brother, the proposal for marriage with the sister-in-law was made after a long conversation. The direct acquaintance with the subject of poetry, along with the poet, has led to much discussion about poetry relationships. The discussion was not only limited to published poems.\n\nRecently, convinced by my arguments, he has proposed marriage with that widow. Initially, there was no agreement at all. He then applied all his reasoning and shed a few tears in her eyes, completely convincing her. Now the widow's guardian wants some money.\n\nI said, 'Take it now.'\n\nHe said, 'Besides that, after marriage, for the first month, my father will definitely stop my monthly allowance, so we have to manage the expenses of both.'\n\nI didn't say a word but wrote a check. I said, 'Tell me her name now.\"\n\nHe said, 'She is extremely reluctant to discuss her widow marriage. Therefore, she strictly forbade talking about her to you. But now that's no longer a lie. She is your neighbor; she lives in house No.17.'\n\nIf the heart's anguish were a molten iron boiler, it would have burst into flames with a single spark. I asked, 'Doesn't she like the idea of a widow marriage?'\n\nHe laughed and said, 'Not at the moment.'\n\nI said, 'Is she just enchanted by reading poetry?'\n\nHe said, 'Why, my poems don't seem bad.'\n\nI said to myself, 'Damn.'\n\nDamn whom? Myself, him or fate? But damn.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2. Reflect the core style of Faulknerian: Utilizes long, complex sentences, multiple perspectives, and a deep sense of place, often set in the American South..\n3. Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the sweltering heat of a Mississippi summer, where the air hung heavy with the scent of magnolias and the weight of unspoken desires, I found myself drawn to the widow next door, her presence a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the endurance of longing in this small Southern town where secrets festered like open wounds beneath the veneer of gentility and tradition.\n\nShe moved about her days with a quiet grace, her every gesture a poem of loss and resilience, and I, in my cowardice, could do naught but watch from afar, my heart burning with a passion I dared not name, even to myself, for fear it might consume me whole, leaving nothing but ashes where once a man had stood.\n\nArnav, my dear friend and confidant, remained blissfully unaware of the tempest raging within me, his own life a study in simplicity and contentment that I both envied and despised, for how could he walk through this world untouched by the searing pain of unrequited love, the kind that threatens to tear a man asunder and remake him in its cruel image?\n\nAnd yet, as the days stretched into weeks and the weeks into months, I found myself unable to contain the flood of emotions that threatened to burst forth from my very being, like the Mississippi in spring, overflowing its banks and drowning all in its path, and so I turned to poetry, that most ancient of arts, in a desperate attempt to give voice to the unspeakable.\n\nBut the words, oh, the words, they refused to come, stubbornly clinging to the recesses of my mind like Spanish moss to the gnarled branches of an old oak, and I was left bereft, a man without language in a world that demanded expression.\n\nIt was then, in the depths of my despair, that Arnav, sweet, oblivious Arnav, took up the pen with a fervor that both astounded and dismayed me, for how could this man, who had never before shown any inclination towards the literary arts, suddenly find himself possessed by the muse of poetry?\n\nHis verses, though clumsy and unrefined, spoke of a love so pure and true that I found myself envious once more, not of his contentment this time, but of his ability to give voice to the very emotions that threatened to tear me apart, and so I offered my assistance, my own suppressed passions finding outlet through his words.\n\nTogether, we crafted lines of longing and desire, of heartache and hope, and with each passing day, I felt myself drawn deeper into the web of deception we were weaving, for though the words were ostensibly Arnav's, they were born of my own tortured soul, a fact that both thrilled and terrified me in equal measure.\n\nAs summer gave way to fall and the leaves began to turn, painting the world in hues of gold and crimson, I found myself increasingly drawn to the widow's home, my eyes seeking out her form through curtained windows and half-open doors, desperate for even the briefest glimpse of her face, which had become to me as necessary as air.\n\nIt was on one such day, as storm clouds gathered on the horizon and the air crackled with the promise of lightning, that I saw her, truly saw her, for the first time since her husband's passing, and what I witnessed shook me to my very core.\n\nFor there, in the fading light of day, stood not a woman resigned to her fate, but one aflame with passion and yearning, her eyes burning with a fire I had thought long extinguished, and in that moment, I knew that I could no longer stand idly by while she suffered in silence.\n\nWith a fervor born of desperation and newfound purpose, I threw myself into the cause of widow remarriage, my words and actions fueled by the memory of that burning gaze and the knowledge that beneath the veneer of propriety and tradition lay a heart as wild and untamed as the kudzu that choked the trees of our Southern forests.\n\nArnav, bless his heart, argued against my newfound crusade, his poetic soul finding beauty in the concept of eternal widowhood, but I would not be swayed, for I had seen the truth of the matter written in the lines of my neighbor's face and the fire in her eyes.\n\nIt was with no small amount of shock, then, that I received Arnav's confession some days later, his words falling upon my ears like the tolling of a funeral bell, for he spoke of a love long harbored for a widow – my widow – and of plans for marriage that had been set in motion by the very poems we had crafted together.\n\nIn that moment, as the full weight of my folly came crashing down upon me, I felt myself torn asunder, my heart rent in twain by the cruel hand of fate and the bitter knowledge that I had, in my blindness and cowardice, orchestrated my own undoing.\n\nAnd so, dear reader, I find myself here, in this godforsaken corner of the South, where the air is thick with the scent of jasmine and the weight of unspoken regrets, a man undone by his own machinations, left to ponder the cruel twists of fate that have brought me to this point and to wonder, in the dark hours of the night, what might have been had I found the courage to speak my heart when it mattered most.",

Happy as one could be.\n\n\nNow it's the millionth time we're having breakfast across from each other. We each make an effort to say something once in a while in between all the media scrolling. We like to pretend we are interested in what the other has to say. I don't know what I hated most. The silence or the obligation of having to say anything.\n\n\"You need to fix the hole in the wall.

Never mind Jack\"\n\nJessica got up, turned around and left the kitchen. She left a half eaten toast on the plate and a lukewarm mug of tea on the table. Tea that she never drank anyways. I truly believe she just enjoyed making it to annoy me. Because she never drank it. And it annoyed me to no end. Like we were swimming in money, to keep wasting it on expensive tea.\n\nI was going to get up and go look for her, but I decided not to. Let her cry if she does. Cleans the soul. I'm tired of it. I cry too, and no one ever comes to see what is wrong.\n\nI got up and looked around. No hole. Was it even in the kitchen? I guess not. Was there even a hole? Who knows. Jessica had a sick sense of humor. This would be the kind of thing she would find funny. Make me go around looking for a hole, just to mess with me.\n\nI sat down and finished my breakfast. But I felt bad. So I went to look for her.\n\n\"Jessica?\"\n\nShe was not in the living room. She was not in the bathroom. Maybe the bedroom?\n\nI nudged the door a bit.\n\n\"Jessica?\"\n\n\"What Jack?\"\n\n\"Jessica, I didn't hear you talk about any hole. I'm sorry. Where is it?\"\n\n\"You never listen Jack\"\n\n\"Do you think I do it on purpose? Do you think I wake up and think about forgetting stuff just to piss you off? If I didn't hear it, I didn't hear it. Is it that hard to understand? Can't I just be stupid or an airhead?\"\n\n\"Forget it…\"\n\n\"I'm sorry ok? Just tell me where the hole is. I'll take a look at it now. Sorry I didn't pay attention before\"\n\n\"It's in the living room, Jack. How can you not see a hole there?\"\n\n\"Where in the living room? I swear I didn't see a hole. Are you fucking with me?\"\n\n\"Jack, everyone can see a hole there. Anyone but you. Please let me get ready for work. Go away\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\nNo response, so I walked away.\n\nI went straight to the living room to check out this hole. I check everywhere. No hole. Behind the tv maybe? No hole. Behind the couch? No hole. On the floor? No hole.\n\n\"Fuck this\"\n\nI went to take a shower before getting ready for work. When I got out of the shower, she was already gone. No goodbye, no nothing. Unbelievable.\n\nBefore leaving for work, I took another glance around the living room. No hole. She was definitely fucking with me. There was nothing here, and there wouldn't be.\n\nWhen I got back from work she was in the living room reading a book.\n\n\"Hey\"\n\n\"Hey\"\n\n\"How was work?\", I asked.\n\n\"Pretty good. Want to go make dinner with me?\"\n\nI was surprised with her mood. Usually when we have a less than friendly morning, there is always an aftershock in the evening. I was glad there wasn't one, because I didn't have the patience today. I didn't want to make dinner either. I wanted to take my clothes off and sit in front of the tv watching some dumb movie. I was tired.\n\n\"I'm tired Jessica, can we just order some pizza and watch a movie instead?\"\n\nHer face turned back to the book, and she almost teared up.\n\n\"What?\", I asked, already starting to get annoyed at a potential aftershock after all.\n\n\"I bought something special for us to make. I thought we could spend some time doing something together. But never mind I guess.\"\n\nAnd now I felt like shit. How was I supposed to know?\n\n\"Shit Jessica, I'm sorry. That sounds great. Let's make dinner together. What are we making?\", I said with fake excitement, but I don't think she noticed.\n\n\"Lamb with potatoes\"\n\nThat was my favorite. Sometimes I really do feel like an asshole.\n\n\"I love you, you know?\", I said, trying to make up for my shitty mood.\n\n\"I know\"\n\nWe went into the kitchen and we made dinner. We had music coming out of my phone. Stuff we heard when we were much younger and just started dating. We were cooking and singing. She was smiling and trying to make me dance. But I don't dance, so I avoided it. I hugged her from behind instead, and didn't let go.\n\n\"You have to let go, if you want to eat unburnt food\"\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nWe had dinner, we drank some wine, and we went to bed afterwards.\n\nI don't remember the last time we spent time together like this. Then we fucked. And that was even rarer these days.\n\nShe got up to go to the bathroom. I stared at the ceiling.\n\nI thought about how much I still loved her. Despite everything lately. Despite the clear void that was looming above our heads. She was still the love of my life. And would forever be. There was still something here to work on.\n\nShe came back and laid next to me. And my intrusive thoughts popped up. It was unbearable to hold it in. I tried and tried, but I couldn't help it. I never could.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"What?\", she asked.\n\n\"You? Screwing with me this morning? Making me believe there was a hole in the living room.\"\n\n\"You think I was screwing with you?\"\n\n\"C'mon Jessica. I went to the living room like an idiot and searched everywhere for a hole that doesn't exist\"\n\n\"Can you stop Jack? You're not being funny. If you don't want to fix it just say it\"\n\n\"I would fix it, if there was a hole to fix\"\n\n\"You want to play this game? Ok, you win. There is no hole. I don't know why I even try\"\n\n\"C'mon don't do this. Ok, I believe you. Just show me where it is then\"\n\n\"Goodnight Jack\"\n\nJessica rolled to her side of the bed. And said no more.\n\nI picked up my phone, my cigarettes and went outside to the balcony. I couldn't sleep anyways. I was scrolling through pointless social media, trying to forget the perfect night I had just ruined, when I got a text from my brother.\n\n\"Yo. How are things going man?\"\n\n\"What's up? Going good, why?\"\n\n\"You know, just asking\"\n\n\"C'mon, I know you. What are you trying to get at? Just come out with it\"\n\n\"First you have to say you won't take this the wrong way. You're my brother and I love you, so I'm just trying to look out for you, ok?\"\n\n\"Hmm, ok? Should I be worried? What is going on?\"\n\n\"It was something I noticed the last time I went there\"\n\n\"What? Last Sunday?\"\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\n\"Just say it dude\"\n\n\"The hole in your wall\"\n\n\"Wtf Dan. Did Jessica tell you to say that?\"\n\n\"What? No. It was just something I noticed. I'm trying to help. It's pretty big, dude. I thought that maybe you couldn't fix it alone and I was trying to lend a hand. Since you didn't mention it, I assumed you were ashamed of it\"\n\n\"I really don't see how this is supposed to be funny. Is it some inside joke that I don't get? Is it some new game the kids are playing that I still haven't heard?\"\n\n\"Ok Jack. Suit yourself. But just so you know, the longer you take to fix it, the bigger it's gonna get pal\"\n\n\"Are you done?\"\n\n\"Whatever dude. Bye\"\n\n\"Bye\"\n\nNow I knew they were fucking with me. Pretty big hole? There is no hole. That's what they want. They got you talking about the hole. They're already winning. I guess that's the game.\n\nI put out the cigarette in the ashtray and went inside.\n\nJessica was already sleeping. I decided to go watch some tv, to see if I could get my eyes to tire. I sat on the couch, and there it was.\n\nIn the wall to the left of the couch. I got up to make sure. It was so small, but it really looked like there was a hole after all. This cannot be it. A huge hole? This is the talk of the town? My finger wouldn't even fit inside. If this was it, then I still don't get the joke. I'll fix it tomorrow. But looking at it now, it was perfectly made. Like a tube. No flaws around it. Completely smooth. I wondered what made this. Didn't even seem possible. Even a drill would leave hard edges in some way. I kept getting my eye close to it. Then more and more. But the closer my eye got to it, the darker it became. My head would block out the light. I swore I saw something inside. I felt my forehead touch the wall. I put it on an angle, but no luck. I took my phone and turned on the flashlight. Got as close as I could with my right eye and flashed inside to try and see. There was something black inside. What was it? I stood back and blew on it. And it came out. One black leg at a time. Its legs, thick and long, curving out of the hole. They shined to the light of the living room. My heart skipped a few beats, and this huge spider crept out, slowly, trying to escape. Or trying to back me off. Without thinking about it, I kicked the wall with the sole of my shoe, trying to kill that thing. I was sure I saw it fall on the ground, but I couldn't see it anywhere. I looked around, frantically, but no luck. I looked at the sole of my shoe, but no luck. I flailed around, maybe it had gotten on my clothes. And felt my whole body shiver.\n\n\"Fuck, fuck, fuck. Where is it? Did it go back in the hole? Did I miss it?\"\n\nI flashed the light back at the hole, keeping my distance from it. I couldn't see anything. I didn't know if it went back inside, or if it fell on the floor and scurried away. One thing was for sure. I hadn't killed it. I then got an idea. Tape. But I couldn't let it out of my sight. What if it crawled back out when I went to get the tape? I had to risk it.\n\nI ran to the kitchen closet and got out the tape. And ran back into the living room. I taped the hole shut. Once and twice. And then again just to be sure. If it was inside, there is no way it's coming back out. But what if it wasn't?\n\nIf I couldn't sleep before, it would be impossible now. I couldn't let go of the thought of both the hole and the black creepy crawly.\n\nI moved the couch and went into the kitchen to get a chair. I brought it to the living room, setting it right in front of that hole. I sat and stared straight at it. I wanted to see if the tape moved. If that evil spawn was inside, maybe it would try to touch the tape. Maybe I would see it move. But it didn't. For ten minutes I sat there. Nothing. Ten minutes more. Nothing. I felt the need to go outside. I looked around again, hoping to find some black thing hiding somewhere else. Found nothing, yet again.\n\nI lit a cigarette outside, and tried to put my mind off it. But I couldn't let the thought of it go. It was unbearable not to think about it. I tried watching videos, but they all seem to mention holes and spiders. I threw the unsmoked cigarette. I paced back to the chair, and sat down.\n\n\"What the fuck?!\"\n\nThe hole had gotten bigger. How? Impossible. But the tape was barely covering the hole now. I could see very small gaps at the edge of the tape.\n\n\"Don't be stupid Jack. It's obvious that the spider clawed at the tape, trying to get out\"\n\nBut no. The tape was in perfect condition. Only smaller. Either the hole got bigger, or the tape shrank. The latter made much more sense. I had to get more tape. I took it from the little table next to me, where I had put the roll before. I took strip after strip. I had the taste of glue on my lips and teeth. The hole was sealed now.\n\n\"Fuck me\"\n\nIt really was bigger. I could feel it in the middle part of the tape, when I ran my finger on top of it. It was definitely bigger. I would say it was now as wide as two fingers. Maybe more.\n\n\"Fuck me. What is this?\"\n\nI couldn't find a reasonable answer for whatever this was. I was late and I was tired. But I still sat there. Watching, staring. Once in a while, I had to touch it. I had to run my finger over the tape. I had to see if it was getting bigger. And it was. Little by little, but it was.\n\n\"What are you doing Jack?\"\n\nIt was Jessica. Somehow it was already morning. It had come out of nowhere.\n\n\"Jessica! I can see it now. I can see the hole\"\n\n\"Have you been up all night?\"\n\n\"I couldn't sleep. I tried to fix it, but it keeps getting bigger\"\n\n\"You can't fix it by staring at it, Jack\"\n\n\"I know that. I put some tape over it. But it isn't working. I need you to stay here, so I can go to the store and get the right stuff to fix it\"\n\n\"I have to go to work, Jack. So do you. We can talk about this later\"\n\n\"Are you serious Jessica? You have been bitching about this hole since yesterday morning. I saw it and I stayed up all night trying to find a solution. And now you say we can do this later? Are you serious?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to try and fix a hole now, Jack. You had plenty of opportunities before. It can wait until we get back. I'm going to get ready for work, and so should you\"\n\nShe went into the bathroom and I heard her turn on the shower.\n\n\"Fuck her\", and I continued staring at it, trying to come up with a solution.\n\nAn hour had passed, just like that.\n\n\"Are you not going to work?\", she asked.\n\n\"I called in sick. Are you really not going to help me?\"\n\n\"I'll see you later, Jack\"\n\nAnd she left.\n\nI got up and ran to the door. I opened it in one hard swing.\n\n\"Jessica!\"\n\nShe didn't look back.\n\n\"FINE! I'LL DO IT MYSELF!\", and I slammed the door as hard as I could, to make a point.\n\nAnd I got back to the chair and stared. Then I picked up my phone and called her. I got no answer, so I called again. Nothing. I wanted to apologize, but she didn't pick up. So I called again. With each call getting angrier and angrier. She wouldn't answer. So I sent her a voice message.\n\n\"Can you pick up the fucking phone? I'm trying to apologize! This is what I get for trying to fix something? So I didn't see it before. Fuck! I see it now! Do you have to be a bitch about it? At least I'm trying. What are you doing?\", and I hung up.\n\nHours passed and I still stared at the hole. Getting bigger and bigger. I was running out of tape. The floor was filled with cigarette buts. I couldn't even bother going outside to smoke. I ran out of smokes. I ran out of tape. The hole kept getting bigger. Slowly, but surely.\n\nIt was night time now. No Jessica. She was supposed to be home hours ago. Where was she? So I called again. Nothing. And I called again. Nothing. I threw the phone on the table.\n\n\"Fucking hole!\", I yelled. Straight into the mesh of tape.\n\nThen my phone beeped. A message. It was from her.\n\n\"I'm not coming home tonight. I need to stay away for a few days. I'm staying at a friend's place. Please stop calling me every second. I can't be in that apartment anymore. I'm afraid to get back in there with you. Please Jack. Stop.\"\n\nSo I texted back.\n\n\"Are you for fucking real?! I'm just trying to fix something YOU asked for!!!!\"\n\n\"I don't know if it can be fixed anymore. Bye Jack\"\n\nI tried calling back, cause I couldn't write and stare at it at the same time. But she didn't pick up. Then I tried again and the call wouldn't go through.\n\n\"FUCK!\", and I threw the phone at the wall. It ripped some of the tape. I was so sick of this hole, so I got up, and started to rip every last bit of tape from the wall.\n\n\"Come on fucker! Come on!\"\"\n\nThe tape was gone. The hole doubled in size. And I stood in front of it, defying it, waiting for something to come out. But there was nothing inside. Just a void. An empty endless void. It was growing and consuming the wall. Then all around me, and I could see nothing. I felt faint, and I collapsed.\n\nI remember waking up to the sound of my brother's voice.\n\n\"Jack, are you ok? Jack, wake up\"\n\nApparently, people from work had been trying to call me for a whole day and got no response. They called my brother, who was my emergency contact, and he came to see if everything was alright. It wasn't.\n\n\"Dude, what the fuck Jack? What is wrong? Are you ok?\"\n\nI wasn't.\n\nJessica never came back. We talked a few days after all this happened to figure things out and we ended things.\n\nI still live in the apartment, and the hole is still there, but I've accepted it and learned to live with it. I accepted there was no fixing it. Funny thing is, I think it's starting to shrink. The less I think about it, the more it shrinks. It will take time, but in time, it'll be gone.\n\nSlowly, but surely.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

Spider? My mind a blank canvas, confusion's brushstrokes painting queries. \"What hole? What spider?\" I mumble, words tumbling out like dice on a craps table.\n\nJessica, up and away, half-eaten toast abandoned, lukewarm tea (never drunk, always made, to vex me surely, as if we swam in coin) left behind, a tableau of domestic disharmony.\n\nShould I follow? Let her weep if she must, soul-cleansing tears. I too cry, unnoticed, unheard, a silent symphony of sorrow.\n\nUp I get, eyes roving, seeking this phantom hole. Kitchen walls pristine, no aperture in sight. Jessica's humor, dark and twisted, perhaps? A jape to send me on a fool's errand?\n\nBreakfast finished, guilt gnawing, I seek her out. \"Jessica?\" I call, voice echoing through empty rooms. Bedroom door ajar, I push, \"Jessica?\"\n\n\"What, Jack?\" Her voice, flat as unleavened bread.\n\nApologies spill forth, a torrent of words, excuses mingling with pleas for understanding. Stupidity claimed, airheadedness offered as explanation.\n\n\"Living room,\" she says, exasperation dripping from each syllable. \"Everyone sees it, Jack. Everyone but you.\"\n\nTo the living room I go, eyes peeled, searching. Behind the telly? Nay. Couch? Nada. Floor? Nix.\n\nShower time, work looming. Jessica gone when I emerge, no farewell, silence our parting gift.\n\nOne last look 'round the living room, no hole to be found. Definitely a jest, cruel and unusual.\n\nWork day done, home again, Jessica reading, mood shifted like quicksand.\n\n\"Dinner together?\" she asks, hope a fragile thing in her voice.\n\nTired am I, movie and pizza my heart's desire, but guilt a heavy cloak upon my shoulders. \"Lamb and potatoes?\" I query, fake enthusiasm barely masking exhaustion.\n\nCook we do, music of our youth filling the air, memories of simpler times dancing between us.

I could see the sun as it light glimmered through and around the tree and its branches just outside of my window as the wind blew through its leaves.\n\n\nWith the quietness of the morning being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids walking by making their way to a nearby school. The early morning sounds would soon go away as I set there in bed Not really wanting to get out of bed to what would be just another day for me.\n\nAs I slowly got up making my to bathroom. Standing there in front of the mirror looking at myself a young Girl closing in on 30! Running my hand back through my messed blonde hair. Thinking to myself as I just stood there looking into the mirror thinking to myself what could a blue eyed girl could do to get through another day.\n\nAnother day of let's see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself standing there in the bathroom putting my clothes on thinking to myself \" Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here\" making my way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Not really knowing where to even begin until I have had my mornings coffee.\n\nSetting down at the kitchen table to the mornings newspaper along with my coffee flipping through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what the day may have to look forward to. I thought to myself \" is there anything left in this Life, was there any faith left in me at all.\n\nKnowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing my things before heading out the door I noticed my coat was still in the closet. Dropping my purse back onto the kitchen table making my way back into my room opening up my closet door. I reaching for it I noticed a box setting there in the corner out of curiosity I reached for grabbing it out of the closet thinking to myself what was in it.\n\nWalking back into the kitchen placing it down onto the kitchen table setting down to open it up to Memories! Memories that later on I knew that I would need I just didn't realize it at the moment. It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter, with one of the photos being of my mom setting there looking at the photo of my mom as I wipe away a tear.\n\nIt didn't seem make my day any better at the moment for today marks ten years since she had passed away. And with me going to visit her grave today it did not make it easier seeing this photo here picking up another photo the memories of yesterday hit me hard as I looked into the photo. Looking at a younger me a young Girl of about twelve years of age with my short brown hair standing there next to my mother.\n\nWho was next to identical to me and setting there beside me was my dog, a dog who I named Buddy. Thinking back I remembered the good times that I had with my dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don't realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.\n\nAnd that was when I found the letter, a letter that I have not seen before today thinking to myself that reading it that it would not make my day any easier. But read it I did, for the letter read as this,\n\n\". To my lovely Daughter Dakota I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize the hard times and the good times that we had together. For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl my little Dakota to me knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself that no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life.\n\nLeaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found, think back back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer that you found, on what Life brought to you that summer just before your teenage Life was to begin. For then when you find it again you know that as your mother a place I have found a place that you will find too. Like some that you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.\n\nReading that sent my mind racing, racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring to me but little did I know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that I would have never knew for someone it would bring that day.\n\nIt was early that morning when I got up not wanting to get out bed just as my dog buddy would come running jumping onto my bed. Licking my face making himself known telling me in his way that another day was here another day to go exploring to find ourselves wondering into a world of our imagination.\n\nGiving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as I got out of bed walking into the kitchen as my mom was making breakfast. Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying \" maybe later I'm not hungry right now\" for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before.\n\nBut before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying \" honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!\" jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying \" just not now mom! I will be back later\" making my way out the door as I looked back at my mom saying \" look I will be back later till then just chilling okay\" as walked out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.\n\nBut now a journey awaited me, a journey that would in time change my Life forever setting on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself what else is out there? What else was there for me in this life.\n\nLooking down at buddy saying to him \" let's go find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here\" with that I stood up saying to buddy \" let's go! Let's see for ourselves what else is out there\" walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line.\n\nI thought to myself once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us! Jumping the fence me and buddy made our way to the road with my house now out of sight I knew now. That we was on our way and that we was also on our own! To where I did not know but we would find out when got there!\n\nWalking down the road dirt a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road that we really seen anybody. Looking at a red farm truck parked on the side of the gas station quickly grabbing buddy as we ran to the truck climbing onto the tailgate.\n\nLaying down inside the back of the pickup me and buddy laid there on the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over covering myself and buddy up. laying there it was not long till I heard the owner getting into the truck not noticing us. Pulling out of the gas station I could feel as the wind hit against the blanket as we made our way down the road.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later uncovering ourselves setting up looking out into the empty fields as we passed by going down the road making sure at the same time that the driver didn't see us. Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing. Saying with a smile saying to him \" I know what you say if you could talk but I know what I am doing \" looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road.\n\nI thought to myself, what was I going to do when I got there? Where was I going to go?\" About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us pulling into a parking lot of a grocery store. Quickly laying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Laying there waiting I then heard the truck door open as a person then got out.\n\nUpon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear before uncovering myself and buddy making our way from the truck not looking back until we was far enough away. Looking across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.\n\nWalking from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk. As people would pass us by not paying any attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves. Until we came across a gentleman setting in front of a convenient store. Looking at him he asked me saying \" well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you\" saying back to him \" thanks buddy here is my dog that my mom got me from the pound\" smiling back to me he then asked me saying \" so where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask\"\n\nReplying back to him I said to him \" just a girl and her dog finding our way in Life looking to what is out here for us.\" Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us \" finding yourself! Why aren't you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you\"? Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for and then you when you are old enough.\n\nThen maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.\" as he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying a drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying\n\n\" Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way!\n\nBut know this little one the memories that you make as a child are memories that keep you going when Life steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep. \" thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy made our way down the street I didn't know then what he said as I would later in Life know for what he meant.\n\nWith the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on me and buddy we decided to make camp there for the night Just with no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me.\n\nThinking to myself about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I laid there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As laid there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me.\n\nSoon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would fall to sleep for that night dreaming of myself and buddy being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. \" You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there has a plan for you in Life\".\n\nFor everyone that you meet in Life will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life\" as I Dreamed I then Dreamed of mom. In my dream she was crying, crying for me saying to me \" Please Dakota come home whenever you are please come back to me\" waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.\n\nThe next morning buddy and myself found our way across the field walking along thinking about the journey ahead the journey would take us to where we was going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way! Spending most of the day keeping in the field Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road looking around I could see a individual standing in a field across the road standing in another field.\n\nThinking to myself we could sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up too the truck climbing over the tailgate and laying down before the individual saw us. It wasn't maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. Laying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we was going. Laying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as I watched the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in Life. A place that I knew I belonged there, but till then I laid there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by I looked to buddy saying \" we are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in Life.\n\nAs the day went by further down the road finding ourselves laying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky coming into view just as the we made our way down the highway. Thirsty and hungry I felt laying there in the bed of pickup for I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as they passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.\n\nI found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world that I was not for sure off. A world that seemed distant to me a world that in time I would come to know. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her\" wait mom please come back please where are you going \" turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying \" I love you Dakota I love you wherever your are\" with that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself what have I done? What have I done to my mom?\n\nJust as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Laying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up.\n\nBut before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me \" what! I can't even believe to what I am seeing!\"Looking at me with a very stunned with a surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying \" you have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there\"\n\nClimbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my and buddies journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said said \"yes very much so\"\n\nAfter me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would arrive. But then I heard a voice I heard a voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me laying there in bed looking at him saying \" hello \"\n\nLooking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me \" who are you\" I replied to him saying \" I am Dakota and what is your name\" as he spoke bake to me saying \" my name is Billy\" walking closer to him I could see that he was sick he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next too him.\n\nStanding there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying \" the Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer and that it may take awhile for me to get better\" just as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy.\n\nAs I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile \" it is okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?\" Replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me \" a journey!\n\nMan I would love to go on a journey someday a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed\" looking to Billy I said to him \" maybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey\" smiling to me Billy just looked at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me\n\n\" I want to so bad to find my place in this Life! I want to just get up from here and go live my Life. But hearing it in my mom and dads voice I can hear it that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life\"\n\nJust then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him \" I hope that one day that you will get better and that you will find your place in Life. And just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together\" as Billy gave buddy one last hug I made my way to front door to where the authorities was waiting there to take me and buddy back home.\n\nAs we made our way back home from our little journey pulling into the drive way back at our farm I could see my mom come running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me \" don't you ever leave me again Dakota! Don't you ever leave like that again me again\" hugging my mom saying to her \"\n\nI promise mom I will never leave you again\" for as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy and Journey that me and buddy went on that day. Thinking as I set there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me.\n\nTelling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Just knowing that I was there with my mom giving me a hug saying to me \" honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.\"\n\nFor the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.\n\nLooking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom's letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.\n\nThinking of the gentleman that I met on my journey with buddy and that he was right when he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood Sometimes help us get through our Life as adults today.\n\nAnd on that day as I stood there at my mom's grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy so many years ago what he said to me! For there was a place for him and for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dads memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me.\n\nFor me to grow to appreciate the Life that I had, For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. There was a place! A Place In Heaven By Terry Pennington Jr\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the grimy, fog-shrouded streets of Victorian London, where the soot-stained buildings loomed like silent sentinels over the teeming masses below, there lived a young woman named Dakota. Her small, drafty room in a dilapidated tenement building was a far cry from the idyllic farm of her youth, but it was all she could afford on her meager seamstress's wages.\n\nAs the first feeble rays of sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick, yellowish haze that perpetually hung over the city, Dakota stirred from her fitful slumber. The threadbare blanket provided little warmth against the damp chill that permeated the air, and she shivered as she sat up in her narrow bed. Through the grimy windowpane, she could just make out the skeletal branches of a lone tree, its leaves long since stripped away by the harsh urban environment.\n\nThe relative quiet of the early morning was soon shattered by the cacophony of street urchins making their way to the nearby workhouse, their thin voices raised in a mixture of laughter and argument. Dakota sighed, knowing that for many of these children, their futures held little more than endless toil and early graves.\n\nReluctantly, she rose from her bed, her joints creaking in protest. At nearly thirty years of age, she felt far older than her years, worn down by the relentless grind of poverty and the crushing weight of unfulfilled dreams. She shuffled to the cracked mirror hanging on the wall, running her fingers through her unkempt blonde hair. Her once-bright blue eyes now seemed dull and lifeless, reflecting the despair that had taken root in her soul.\n\nAs she donned her shabby work dress, Dakota found herself questioning the very purpose of her existence. What hope was there for a woman of her station in this cruel and unforgiving world? She made her way to the tiny kitchen, where she lit the ancient stove with trembling hands, desperate for the meager comfort of a cup of weak tea.\n\nSettling at the rickety table with her steaming cup, Dakota unfolded the previous day's newspaper, which she had salvaged from a rubbish bin. As she perused the pages, filled with tales of society balls and political machinations that seemed to belong to another world entirely, she felt a familiar ache in her chest. Was there truly nothing left for her in this life? Had faith abandoned her completely?\n\nJust as she was about to surrender to the crushing weight of her despair, Dakota's eye fell upon a small wooden box tucked away in the corner of the room. With a mixture of curiosity and trepidation, she retrieved it, setting it upon the table with reverent care.\n\nAs she opened the lid, a flood of memories washed over her. Inside lay a carefully preserved scrapbook, filled with faded photographs and mementos of a happier time. With trembling fingers, she lifted out a portrait of her mother, a woman whose face bore such a striking resemblance to her own. Tears welled in Dakota's eyes as she realized that today marked the tenth anniversary of her mother's passing.\n\nAmong the treasures in the box, Dakota discovered a letter she had never before seen. The paper was yellowed with age, the ink faded, but her mother's elegant script was still legible. As she read the heartfelt words penned by her mother so long ago, Dakota felt a spark of something she had thought long extinguished: hope.\n\nThe letter spoke of faith, of perseverance in the face of adversity, and of the enduring power of love. It reminded Dakota of a summer long past, when she had been but a child on the cusp of adolescence. A summer that had changed everything.\n\nAs she lost herself in the memories of that fateful time, Dakota's mind wandered back to the day she had run away from home, accompanied only by her faithful dog, Buddy. She recalled the kind gentleman who had shown her unexpected kindness, offering words of wisdom that she had been too young to fully appreciate at the time.\n\nThe letter concluded with a poignant reminder that there was a place in Heaven for all those who struggled and suffered in this mortal realm. As Dakota folded the letter with reverent care, she felt a subtle shift within herself. The crushing weight of despair began to lift, replaced by a fragile but growing sense of purpose.\n\nRising from her chair with newfound determination, Dakota made a silent vow to honor her mother's memory by finding meaning in her life, no matter how difficult the path might be. She would strive to be a beacon of hope for others trapped in the cycle of poverty, just as that kind stranger had been for her so many years ago.\n\nAs she prepared to face another day in the unforgiving streets of London, Dakota clutched the letter to her heart, drawing strength from the love that transcended even death. Though the road ahead would be fraught with hardship and sorrow, she now carried within her the unshakeable belief that there was indeed a place for her in this vast and often cruel world – a place of purpose, of compassion, and ultimately, of redemption.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully captures the Dickensian style with detailed descriptions, complex character introspection, and evocative social commentary.

That was its name even though no one knew exactly why. That was how they had deciphered the strange carvings on its walls. Forgotten Knowledge was a puzzling name for what was contained inside, if that was so. Perhaps the explanation lay inside the tomb too.\n\nThe whispers started up again as he gazed at the ruins. At the start of it all they had terrified him and he'd done his best to block them out. Now, though, they felt comforting. They felt familiar. They were almost intelligible, if he could just listen a bit closer…\n\nMiriam looked at him. She said his name.\n\nHe nodded. \"It's here.\"\n\n\"I can't change your mind, can I?\" Her eyes were sad.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I have to do this, or I won't be me anymore.\"\n\nDid she understand what he meant when he said that? He wasn't sure.\n\nEverything had begun with the eclipse. That day when darkness took over the moon and swallowed the sun, and shadows covered the whole land. It was an ill omen indeed for the darkness to gain such strength so suddenly.\n\nA fell power had made its way into the world then. The signs were obvious. It was skulking through the land, looking to corrupt everything it touched.\n\nFive days in the calendar year had already fallen under its influence, some whispered. There were signs that set them apart. The year had always had 365 days but now some of them had broken away from the months they were part of. They wandered through the span of the year instead, causing chaos and terrible signs whenever they struck.\n\nHe wasn't born on one of those days. He knew that much. Certainly the day his mother had brought him into the world was nothing special. They had called around friends and neighbors and celebrated the birth with food and song.\n\nAnd yet it was on one of those dark days that his eyes had been truly opened and he had taken the first step down the road of truly becoming himself. He hadn't gone mad, though sometimes he wished he could believe that. It would have been so much easier to be mad than accept that so much of what he knew was a lie, a dream, a delusion he had to wake up from.\n\nBut the newfound legion of voices in his head didn't lie. They were a barely audible buzz in the background most of the time but whenever they spoke, they spoke true. Not once had they ever caused him harm.\n\nWhat they said was this: the face he saw in mirrors wasn't his. It was a mask, a fake. His real one was somewhere else.\n\nThe visions came to him in dreams, growing increasingly clearer as he learned to draw power from the darkness and allowed the voices to speak freely. Somewhere in the wilderness, there was an old ruin that led down to a sprawling set of catacombs. In the winding maze of its rooms, there was a white mask that would make him whole.\n\nHe wasn't the only one searching for it, though. All around the world people had dreams and visions of what they came to call the Tomb of Forgotten Knowledge. Deep in the wilderness, far beneath the ground, past countless traps and dangers, there was a priceless treasure beyond anything else in the world. It held the answers to everything. It was the key to something monumental.\n\nIt was strange, though. None of the other seekers were searching for a mask.\n\nMiriam was the only one he had trusted with that secret.\n\n\"Do you want to leave now?\" he asked her. \"This can't have been easy for you.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I can't say I understand all this. I'll stay with you though. For as long as I can.\"\n\nShe said it as though she was daring him to send her away. But he wouldn't do that.\n\nThey descended down the carved rocky steps into the depths of the earth.\n\nThe darkness felt solid, somehow. They kept walking.\n\nUntil they came to a room in the caves.\n\n\"It's a dead end,\" Miriam said. \"We should turn back.\"\n\n\"Is it not?\" he asked, perplexed. \"But I can see something there.\"\n\nShe looked just as confused as he felt, but she didn't argue. \"I'll wait here.\"\n\nHe stepped forward. Out of the corner of his eye he saw her blink and rub her eyes as though she was seeing something impossible. But he was now in the room that was only there for him.\n\nThe white mask lay on top of a stone pedestal. It looked just like how he'd seen it in his dreams.\n\nHe put it on and everything came flooding back. It all made sense now. All his questions were answered. This was always who he had been. This was what he had forgotten.\n\nA woman approached as he stepped out of the room. He had known her name once, but it seemed so unimportant now. She was brave and clever and strong, she had sacrificed a great deal to stay by his side and he had never been able to repay her. Wasn't that enough to know a person?\n\n\"Go home,\" he said. The voices would speak for him if he commanded them to, but he wanted to use the one he had been born with in this most recent life. It felt important. \"There is nothing more for you here.\"\n\nTears came to her eyes. \"This is the end, isn't it? You died in that room and I wasn't there to save you.\"\n\n\"You were too good for him,\" he said. It seemed less important now to hold on to this voice, to assign such importance to one among many. \"Go. I'll see you safely through.\"\n\nThe darkness parted for her. It would always be there, just at her back, ready to rise like a tidal wave and devour all who meant her harm. He owed her that much.\n\nIt was time to make the world anew.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The Tomb of Forgotten Knowledge loomed impossibly, its architecture defying all logic, with staircases leading to nowhere and doors opening onto solid walls.\n\nThe whispers that had plagued him for months grew louder, no longer intelligible but now a cacophony of insect-like buzzing that threatened to split his skull. He tried to block them out, but they seemed to emanate from within his very bones.\n\nMiriam stood beside him, but when he turned to look at her, her face was a blank slate, featureless and smooth. He called her name, but his voice came out as a series of incomprehensible clicks and whistles.\n\n\"We must proceed,\" he tried to say, but the words fell from his mouth as writhing tentacles that slithered across the ground.\n\nThey descended into the ruins, but with each step, the walls seemed to close in, shifting and pulsating like living flesh. Time lost all meaning; they could have been walking for minutes or millennia.\n\nThe eclipse that had started it all replayed endlessly in the sky above them, the sun and moon locked in an eternal dance of light and shadow. Five days had broken free from the calendar, now floating through the air as tangible objects, their edges razor-sharp and dripping with a black ichor that burned the ground where it fell.\n\nHe knew he wasn't born on one of those days, but he could no longer remember his birthday or even his own name. His identity felt like a mask he wore, ill-fitting and suffocating.\n\nThey reached a chamber that seemed both impossibly vast and claustrophobically small. In the center stood a pedestal, atop which sat a white mask that was somehow more real than anything else in this nightmarish world.\n\nAs he approached the mask, Miriam's featureless face began to melt, revealing a writhing mass of tentacles beneath. He wanted to scream, but his mouth had sealed shut, leaving only muffled grunts.\n\nHe placed the mask on his face, and suddenly everything made sense in the most horrifying way possible. He understood the true nature of reality, the cosmic joke that was existence, and the utter meaninglessness of it all.\n\nWhen he turned back to Miriam, or what had once been Miriam, he spoke in a voice that was not his own, in a language that had never been meant for human tongues.

{"id": "text_completion_073", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Faulknerian: Utilizes long, complex sentences, multiple perspectives, and a deep sense of place, often set in the American South.\n[Reference Story]: The first thing Zephyr became aware of was the ticking. It resonated through his being, a rhythmic pulse that seemed to echo the very essence of his existence. Tick... tock... tick... tock... The sound was both comforting and unsettling, a paradox that mirrored the confusion swirling within him.\n\n\nSlowly, consciousness crept in, bringing with it a flood of sensations. Zephyr's eye, a mesmerizing spiral that resembled an intricate clock face, snapped open. The sudden influx of visual information was overwhelming, and it took him a moment to process his surroundings.\n\nHe found himself submerged in a bathtub, but this was no ordinary bath. The liquid that enveloped him was thick and shimmering, filled with what appeared to be... timepieces? Pocket watches, wristwatches, and clock hands floated lazily around him, creating a surreal soup of temporality.\n\n\"Where am I?\" Zephyr thought, his inner voice tinged with confusion. \"Who am I?\"\n\nWith great effort, the small, iridescent mollusk struggled to extricate himself from the viscous chronological concoction. As he emerged, liquid clocks dripped off his shell, revealing an even more astounding sight. Through his translucent exterior, intricate clockwork gears were visible, ticking away in perfect synchronization with his thoughts.\n\nZephyr's gaze darted around the room, trying to make sense of his environment. What he saw defied all logic and reason. Furniture crawled along the walls as if gravity was merely a suggestion. A window offered a view of a cityscape where skyscrapers bent and swayed like noodles in a cosmic soup.\n\n\"This can't be right,\" Zephyr muttered to himself, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Is this what reality is supposed to look like?\"\n\nDesperate for something familiar, anything to anchor himself in this sea of absurdity, Zephyr's attention was drawn to a moldy sandwich resting on a plate nearby. He inched towards it, driven by a curiosity he couldn't explain. As he approached, something extraordinary happened. The pearl embedded in his shell began to emit a faint, pulsating glow.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Zephyr wondered aloud, both fascinated and frightened by this new development.\n\nTentatively, he extended a tendril towards the sandwich. The moment he made contact, reality itself seemed to hiccup. The mold receded as if being rewound, the bread un-staled before his very eyes, and within seconds, the sandwich looked as though it had just been prepared.\n\nZephyr recoiled, his mind reeling from what he had just witnessed. \"Did I... did I just reverse time for this sandwich?\" he asked, his voice filled with equal parts wonder and disbelief.\n\nBefore he could ponder this newfound ability further, a loud crash from somewhere beyond the room shattered the silence. Zephyr instinctively retreated into his shell, his entire being on high alert.\n\n\"It's in here somewhere,\" a muffled voice called out, its tone laced with menace. \"Find the mollusk!\"\n\nPanic surged through Zephyr. \"Mollusk? Are they talking about me?\" he whispered, his voice trembling.\n\nThe door to the room burst open with a resounding crack. Two figures entered, unlike anything Zephyr had ever seen (not that he could remember seeing much of anything before this moment). They were Shadowcrats – beings composed of living shadow, with pocketwatch eyes that ticked ominously as they scanned the room.\n\n\"There it is!\" one of them shouted, its gaze fixed squarely on Zephyr. \"Get the pearl!\"\n\nTerror gripped Zephyr, and he retreated further into his shell. As he did so, the pearl embedded within began to glow with an intensity that rivaled the neon lights outside. \"Stay away!\" he cried out, more in desperation than defiance.\n\nWhat happened next defied explanation. A wave of energy, shimmering with the essence of time itself, pulsed outward from Zephyr. The Shadowcrats were caught in its wake, and to Zephyr's amazement, they began to age rapidly before his eyes. Their shadowy forms gained wrinkles, their movements became slower, and wisps of what could only be described as gray hair sprouted from their inky bodies.\n\n\"What's... happening... to us?\" one of the Shadowcrats croaked, its voice now brittle with artificial age.\n\nSeizing the opportunity presented by their confusion, Zephyr made a break for the door. He found himself in a hallway that seemed to have been designed by a madman with a penchant for impossible geometry. Stairs led to ceilings, doors opened into solid walls, and the very concept of up and down seemed to be in constant flux.\n\n\"Okay, okay, think,\" Zephyr told himself, trying to calm the panic threatening to overwhelm him. \"If I can control time, maybe I can...\"\n\nHe focused intently, channeling all of his concentration into the pearl. It responded, glowing with an otherworldly light. Suddenly, the world around Zephyr seemed to slow to a crawl. He found himself moving at normal speed while everything else, including the pursuing Shadowcrats, lumbered along as if trapped in molasses.\n\n\"Stooooop hiiiiim!\" one of the Shadowcrats bellowed, its voice distorted and deep in the warped timescape.\n\nZephyr navigated the mind-bending hallways with newfound agility, occasionally reaching out to touch objects in his path. With each contact, time ebbed and flowed around the items – some aged to dust, others reverted to pristine condition. Each manipulation created a new obstacle for his pursuers, buying Zephyr precious seconds in his escape.\n\nAt last, he reached a window. Pausing for just a moment, Zephyr gazed out at the surreal vista of Lumina City. Neon signs flickered in colors that shouldn't exist, advertising products and services that defied comprehension. Streets twisted like Möbius strips, looping back on themselves in ways that made Zephyr's head spin.\n\n\"Well, here goes nothing,\" he said, summoning every ounce of courage he possessed.\n\nWith that, Zephyr leaped from the window. As he fell, he concentrated on his newfound temporal abilities, willing the air around him to slow his descent. To his relief and amazement, it worked. He floated gently to the sidewalk below, landing with all the grace of a feather.\n\nLooking back up at the building he'd just fled, Zephyr saw the Shadowcrats peering down from the window. Their pocketwatch eyes spun wildly, ticking with what could only be described as fury.\n\n\"I don't know who I am or why those things are after me,\" Zephyr said to himself, a newfound determination in his voice, \"but I'm going to find out.\"\n\nWith that declaration, he turned and began to move deeper into the bizarre landscape of Lumina City. As he did, however, he noticed something troubling. Hairline fractures were spreading across the surface of his pearl, pulsing with an otherworldly light that seemed to flicker in and out of existence.\n\n\"That can't be good,\" Zephyr muttered, a note of worry creeping into his voice.\n\nAround him, the very fabric of time began to splinter. People on the street moved backwards, rewinding through their own personal histories. A nearby building aged rapidly, crumbling to dust before his eyes, only to reform anew in the next instant. Zephyr clutched his pearl, which was growing uncomfortably warm, as the world kaleidoscoped around him in a dizzying display of temporal chaos.\n\nAs reality itself seemed to fray at the edges, Zephyr realized that his journey was only just beginning. Whatever answers he sought about his identity and purpose lay somewhere in the twisted heart of Lumina City. And with each tick and tock of his internal clockwork, he drew closer to unraveling the mystery of the Clockwork Mollusk.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

With a curiosity that defied explanation, he inched towards it, the pearl embedded in his shell beginning to emit a faint, pulsating glow that seemed to push back against the encroaching shadows of the room.\n\nThe moment his tendril made contact with the decaying bread, reality itself seemed to hiccup, the mold receding like the tide pulling back from a sun-baked shore, the bread un-staling before his very eye, as if time itself had been wound backwards by the mere touch of this strange, clockwork creature.\n\nBut before Zephyr could fully comprehend the implications of this newfound ability, a crash from somewhere beyond the confines of the room shattered the heavy silence, sending ripples through the stagnant air and causing the very foundations of the old house to shudder and groan in protest.\n\n\"It's in here somewhere,\" a voice called out, its tone laced with a menace that seemed to seep through the cracks in the walls and pool on the warped floorboards. \"Find the mollusk!\"\n\nPanic surged through Zephyr like a flash flood through a dry creek bed, his entire being recoiling at the threat that loomed just beyond the peeling door. As it burst open with a resounding crack that echoed through the decaying hallways of the once-grand mansion, two figures entered—Shadowcrats, beings composed of living shadow, their pocketwatch eyes ticking ominously as they scanned the room with a hunger that seemed to devour what little light remained.\n\nIn that moment, as terror gripped him with icy tendrils that seemed to reach into the very core of his being, Zephyr retreated further into his shell, the pearl embedded within beginning to glow with an intensity that rivaled the merciless sun beating down upon the kudzu-choked ruins outside.\n\nWhat happened next defied explanation, a wave of energy shimmering with the very essence of time itself pulsing outward from Zephyr's small form, catching the Shadowcrats in its wake and subjecting them to the ravages of accelerated time. Their shadowy forms gained wrinkles like the cracked mud of a drought-stricken riverbed, their movements slowing to a crawl as if wading through molasses on a cold winter's morn.\n\nSeizing the opportunity presented by their confusion, Zephyr made a desperate dash for the door, finding himself in a hallway that seemed to have been designed by a madman with a penchant for impossible geometry, where stairs led to ceilings and doors opened into solid walls, the very concept of up and down as fluid and changeable as the muddy waters of the Mississippi after a spring storm.\n\nAs he navigated the mind-bending corridors of the decaying mansion, occasionally reaching out to touch objects in his path and watching as time ebbed and flowed around them—some aging to dust, others reverting to pristine condition—Zephyr finally reached a window that looked out upon the surreal vista of what had once been a thriving plantation.\n\nWith a courage born of desperation and a newfound determination to uncover the truth of his existence, Zephyr leaped from the window, willing the very air around him to slow his descent as he floated gently to the overgrown grounds below, landing with all the grace of a cottonwood seed on a lazy summer breeze.\n\nAs he turned to face the twisted landscape before him, Zephyr noticed something troubling: hairline fractures spreading across the surface of his pearl, pulsing with an otherworldly light that seemed to flicker in and out of existence like fireflies on a warm Southern night.\n\nAround him, the very fabric of time began to splinter and fray, the kudzu growing and retreating in rapid cycles, the ruined buildings of the plantation aging and rejuvenating in a dizzying display of temporal chaos that threatened to tear apart the very foundations of reality itself.\n\nAnd so, with each tick and tock of his internal clockwork, Zephyr set out into the heart of this fractured Southern landscape, knowing that somewhere amidst the ruins of the past and the uncertain promise of the future lay the answers to the mystery of the Clockwork Mollusk, and perhaps, in uncovering those secrets, he might find a way to mend the broken threads of time itself.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The response captures the core plot and key elements of the reference story, transforming the style and tone to a Faulknerian style with long, complex sentences and a deep sense of place set in the American South.

She didn't care about being popular, whether boys liked her or got good grades.\n\n\nWinnre wanted to take photos of tombstones, and she didn't care what the park hours were, when she was supposed to be home, or whether the graveyard was built like a maze. It was basically a catacomb but above ground, but she had never paid attention to that kind of thing.\n\nWinnre had gotten it into her head recently that graveyard and grave photography was the next big thing, and she was damned if she was going to miss out on the next trend of the only hobby that actually mattered to her.\n\nWinnre entered the graveyard through the appropriate entrance, her gear at her side. She didn't look around her. She didn't read a single sign, and she didn't text her mother where she went or when she would be home. She didn't care if anyone struggled to find her because she wasn't thinking about anyone else at that moment.\n\nWinnre hardly ever thought about anyone else, period. It's why she was comfortable walking on graves to take her pictures and why she was there long after the sunset, even though her mom had been expecting her to come straight home after school.\n\nWinnre simply continued to take photos until it got too dark for her to see and too dark to take any more pictures. It was then that she looked around and realized that aside from the graveyard, she had no idea where she was. She couldn't see the fence—she couldn't see the street lights — she couldn't see any landmarks that were useful to any degree.\n\nShe tried not to panic. She had been in this graveyard before, and she should be able to find her way out. There was an entire portfolio in her bedroom filled with pictures of these headstones; she just needed to calm down and think.\n\nThink, she scolded herself. Think about which way you came in to get here.\n\nWinnre looked around, glancing at the names on the headstones, but none of them stood out to her. She didn't recognize the path she was on, and there were no footprints anywhere. There actually was hardly a visible path at all, but she didn't let it stop her. If she walked forward long enough, she would reach a gate or a street, and she would use that to take her home. It's that simple.\n\nIt should have been that simple, at least. The graveyard was a bigger one in town, but it was not infinite. There didn't exist any singular place that sprawled on forever, so it was just a matter of getting to the end.\n\nAnd so the girl walked. She tucked her stuff close to her and walked forward, making sure not to veer too far in any direction; even when she had to walk around tombstones and trees and other obstacles, she found the straight path again. That was the best way for her to get to the end of the graveyard.\n\nIt absolutely, for sure, had an end if she could find it.\n\nShe told herself this when her stomach growled because she didn't have so much as a granola bar with her. She hadn't thought about being gone for quite so long when she packed her stuff that day and ate all of her lunch stuff.\n\nWhich made sense at the time, but now I feel a bit stupid.\n\nShe kept walking anyway. The longer she went, the quieter everything seemed to get around her. Her footsteps echoed in the darkness, and the silence began to press in on her.\n\nThe headstones seemed to lean in closer, their inscriptions unreadable, even if she shined a light on them.\n\nAs the sun left her, the air grew unseasonably cold, which she tried not to think about. Instead, she continued to tell herself that nowhere had gone on forever. This place, like all others, had to have an end.\n\nAt some point, she tried to look at her phone for the time, but the clock seemed to have stopped, and by the looks of it, it had actually stopped hours ago. Winnre thought to herself that it was impossible and she just needed to restart it when she got home.\n\nWhatever it took to keep herself sane in that moment. No panicking, only walking. She had to be close to the gates.\n\nHad to be.\n\nThe few trees within the graveyard loomed over her, and it became more difficult to breathe normally.\n\nWinnre didn't care about many things beyond her photographs, but she found herself fighting with herself as she walked. She cared about the shadows, and the ache in her legs, and the branches that swayed in the breeze like fingers trying to follow her as she tried to escape.\n\nHours passed. Winnre didn't know how many because she couldn't figure out how time was passing anymore. She wondered stupidly if it was passing at all — maybe she wasn't finding her way out because she was frozen somehow, and nothing mattered at all.\n\nWhen her feet began to cramp from walking too much in one day, she sank against a tombstone and tried not to think about who was underneath her.\n\nExhaustion took over, forcing her heavy eyelids to close even though she swore she heard whispers drawing near.\n\nWhen her eyes opened again, the air around her was taken over by a deep mist. Shadows moved at the edge of her vision, and when she tried to stand to get away from them, her body refused to obey.\n\nThere was no standing up, and there was no finding her way out. Winnre wanted more than anything to fight herself, to wake up from the lame dream she was having, but when a hand grabbed her shoulder to pull her further down, she stopped letting herself have the thoughts.\n\nShe wasn't leaving the graveyard.\n\nAnd to think, she had just wanted to take some pictures.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

She didn't care about popularity contests, boys, or getting straight A's like most of her classmates. No, Winnre's passion was photography, and lately, she'd become obsessed with capturing images of tombstones and mausoleums.\n\nIt was a crisp October afternoon when Winnre decided to skip her last period and head to the old Millbrook Cemetery. The place was ancient, dating back to the 1700s, with crumbling headstones and overgrown paths that twisted like a maze through the grounds. Winnre had heard whispers about the cemetery being haunted, but she brushed them off as small-town superstition.\n\nAs she stepped through the rusted iron gates, a chill ran down her spine. The air felt heavy, almost oppressive, but Winnre shrugged it off and focused on her camera. She'd forgotten to text her mom about staying out late, but it wouldn't be the first time. Photography was all that mattered right now.\n\nHours passed as Winnre snapped shot after shot, stepping over graves and ducking under low-hanging branches. The sun began to set, casting long shadows across the cemetery. That's when things started to feel... off.\n\nThe whisper came first, so faint she almost missed it. \"Winnre...\" It sounded like it was coming from everywhere and nowhere at once. She spun around, heart racing, but saw nothing but tombstones stretching into the gathering darkness.\n\nSuddenly aware of how late it had gotten, Winnre decided it was time to leave. But as she tried to retrace her steps, nothing looked familiar. The paths seemed to shift and change, leading her deeper into the heart of the cemetery instead of towards the exit.\n\nPanic began to set in as the last rays of sunlight disappeared. Winnre fumbled for her phone, only to find it dead. Impossible – she'd charged it fully before leaving home. The darkness pressed in around her, and the whispers grew louder, more insistent.\n\n\"Winnre... stay with us...\"\n\nShe broke into a run, stumbling over hidden roots and graves. The branches of ancient trees seemed to reach out, trying to snag her clothes and hair. In the distance, she saw a flicker of light. Hope surged through her as she sprinted towards it, thinking it must be the street beyond the cemetery walls.\n\nBut as she got closer, Winnre realized with growing horror that the light was coming from within the graveyard itself. It was a pale, sickly glow emanating from a circle of weathered tombstones. And gathered around them were... figures. Translucent, shimmering forms that looked almost human, but not quite.\n\nWinnre tried to scream, but no sound came out. She turned to run, but her feet wouldn't move. It was as if the very ground beneath her had come alive, holding her in place.\n\nThe ghostly figures drifted closer, their whispers growing into a deafening chorus. \"Join us, Winnre. Stay forever. Your pictures brought us back, and now you'll never leave.\"\n\nAs icy, incorporeal hands reached for her, Winnre's last coherent thought was of her camera, still clutched tightly in her grasp. She'd wanted to capture the essence of death in her photographs, never imagining that death might want to capture her in return.\n\nDays later, when the police finally found Winnre's body in the cemetery, they were baffled. The girl appeared to have aged decades overnight, her hair turned white, her skin withered and gray. And clutched in her hands was her camera, the memory card filled with hundreds of images of ghastly, spectral faces peering out from between the tombstones.\n\nThe case was never solved, but to this day, visitors to Millbrook Cemetery swear they sometimes see a young girl with a camera wandering the grounds at twilight, forever searching for the perfect shot – and a way out.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to Stephen King's style by incorporating everyday settings, relatable characters, and elements of horror, suspense, and supernatural phenomena.

All they said was I should ask you and that I'd be having a long night ahead of me\".\n\nHartford chuckled softly. \"Fuckers.. Alright I'll make this simple\".\n\nThey then stopped at a ladder propped up against the trench line and he pointed at a dead corpse stuck on a string of barbed wire between them and the enemy trenches.\n\n\"You see the stiff over there?\" Hartford asked.\n\n\"Murray\". Dixon corrected him. \"I knew him, his name was Murray\".\n\n\"It doesn't matter\" Hartford answered. \"He's dead now and command wants us to get him and his friends off that wire and out of sight from our men. They say it damages the morale\".\n\nDixon stared at Murray's cold dead eyes that pierced through the darkness and nodded.

We'll use the moon as our only source of light and divide ourselves.

The attack only happened a few hours ago. I've heard stories that men can rot out there for days on that wire.\"\n\nHartford only shook his head. \"Don't make yourself a target. Just take care of the bodies and get back safe. I don't want to bury another replacement\".\n\nWith that Hartford rubbed some mud on his face and crawled out of the trench and Dixon did the same a moment later.\n\nIt was hard at first. The stench from the bodies made Dixon gag and the flies were annoyed that someone was interrupting their meal. But the worst part at all was looking at them.\n\nBut by the third body, Dixon just shut his nose and nearly ripped them off the wire without so much as even glancing at their faces.\n\nHe then came to the last one in his sector and put the wire cutter to the man's arm when the living man jerked and shouted.\n\nDixon panicked and hit the ground as the man began to plead in the darkness. \"Please! Please help me!\"\n\nDixon slid his hand over the man's mouth. \"It's okay I'm here.. Listen, I'm going to get you out of here but you have to be quiet.\"\n\nThe man agreed and did his best to be quiet when Dixon began to cut him from the barbed wire. But the pain of flesh ripping from metal made him nearly scream in anguish and Dixon tried his best to calm him down.\n\n\"Hey, do you have a family?\" Dixon asked as he finished tearing his leg off the wire.\n\nThe man nodded \"I have two daughters.. Oh my God, I've barely thought about them all this time. Listen, you have to tell them I love them if I don't make it out of here.\"\n\nDixon stared at the enemy trench line as he held his breath for a moment and then kept cutting \"Tell them yourself when you get out of here.\"\n\nHe then ripped his other leg away and the man screamed in pain again as a sniper's bullet ripped into the ground beside them.\n\nDixon dropped the wire cutters and cussed his bad luck before helping the man to his feet but he shook his head. \"I can't walk.. I can't feel my legs.\"\n\nThe sniper's aim got better and a bullet struck the post next to Dixon's head as he picked the man up and carried him.\n\nCold blood began leaking all over his back as Dixon ran and more shots rang out in the night.\n\n\"You're going to be okay I promise. Just think about your daughters we're almost there.\" Dixon tried to comfort the man as more blood ran down his back.\n\nThe sentry at the trench line began shooting back at the sniper and Dixon nearly collapsed as they fell into the trench where Hartford was there waiting for him.\n\n\"What happened?\" He asked angrily. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nDixon immediately stood up and grabbed the man's hand to drag him. \"Give me a hand, this man needs to see a medic immediately or he's going to die\".\n\nHartford flipped over the man's corpse and shook his head. \"You've wasted your time. I'm sorry but this man's already dead.\"\n\nDixon looked down and saw a fresh bullet wound through the man's neck and his cold dead eyes staring back at him.\n\n\"I promised him he'd be okay,\" Dixon said staring at his hands that were now caked in blood.\n\nHartford patted Dixon on the back and knelt beside him. \"I can take care of him. Get to a dressing station and clean yourself off\".\n\nDixon did as he was told and slumped off to the rear trench line as Hartford checked the man's body and found a set of ID tags and a photograph of two little girls with an address scribbled on the back.\n\n\"Great\".

Dixon nodded, unsure if he had actually moved.\n\n\"Good,\" Hartford's voice came from everywhere and nowhere at once. \"Leave your rifle and follow me.\"\n\nAs they stepped out of the dugout, Dixon found himself in an endless maze of trenches. The mud beneath his feet seemed to breathe, pulsating with each step. The sky above was an impossible shade of green, casting an eerie glow on everything.\n\n\"You know why you're here?\" Hartford's voice asked, though his mouth didn't move.\n\n\"No,\" Dixon heard himself say, though he wasn't sure he had spoken. \"They said I'd be having a long night ahead of me, but time doesn't seem to exist here.\"\n\nHartford's laughter reverberated through the trenches, causing the walls to ripple like water. \"Fuckers...

Please help me!\" the man begged, his voice coming from Dixon's own mouth.\n\nDixon tried to free the man, but with each cut, the barbed wire grew back stronger. The man's daughters appeared, watching with eyes that were both judging and forgiving.\n\nSuddenly, bullets that looked like tiny, screaming faces began to rain down around them. Dixon picked up the man, who was now both heavier than the world and lighter than air. As he ran, he felt the man's blood seeping into his skin, becoming a part of him.\n\nThey fell into the trench, which had become a gaping maw ready to swallow them.

You'll get fat!\"\n\nThe sounds stopped.\n\nThe simple wooden desk in his bedroom was a mess of papers, but he knew where everything was. His lamp began to flicker erratically, so he turned on the overhead light.\n\nThere had been multiple busy news cycles, and he had been burning the candle at both ends for months. Grant told himself that it was worth tolerating this for the cheap rent. It was too late to regret taking out student loans for a journalism degree.\n\nSo far, he'd been unable to convince even a single person other than his landlord that he was being obnoxiously haunted. On the rare occasions women stayed overnight, they thought he had set up some elaborate, poor taste prank and never spoke to him again.\n\nHe rewrote his last paragraph until he was happy with it. The opener was a little sensationalist for the fairly respectable publication employing him, so he fixed it.\n\nThe feeling that someone was looking over his shoulder was unshakable. He already had an editor like that and was annoyed.\n\nFinally submitting his article at 3 am was a relief. There was still a little of the scotch his brother had gifted him for his birthday, so he poured a few shots in the nicest glass that had not yet been smashed by the stupid ghost.\n\nSomeone knocked decisively at the door. He was shocked to open it and discover it was the police. He had just submitted a scathing article regarding their handling of a recent peaceful protest, and in his slightly inebriated state wondered how they had found out so fast.\n\n\"Your neighbors called in a noise complaint. What's going on?\"\n\nGrant felt that explaining that it was just the ghost lacked a certain something, so he told them the TV had been turned up loud, and it was off now.\n\nThat was apparently acceptable.\n\n------\n\nHis landlord, who lived in the apartment above him, came to check on him the next morning. He was awake. He remembered sleep fondly from his youth.\n\nIt was necessary to move some books and papers off the kitchen table to sit and have a cup of coffee with Mrs. Hawke. He often felt that his cheerful, yellow kitchen was completely inappropriate, but it was three bus transfers to a store that sold paint. An unregarded wall clock ticked away time, oblivious to daylight savings. The only thing required of it was to count twelve minutes for hard boiled eggs, but one day it would be accurate again.\n\n\"The ghost was slamming shut cabinet doors, and someone called in a noise complaint. That's why the cops came.\"\n\nMrs. Hawke was not without sympathy. Most people only saw as far as her stern, steel gray bun and plain clothing, failing to notice her compassionate, warm brown eyes past her resting bitch face.\n\n\"How is that going? Is there anything I can do?\"\n\n\"Research is ongoing,\" he said. \"I'm having a difficult time finding a good source. Mostly what people have to say about ghosts sounds insane. Do I sound like that when I try to tell other people?\"\n\nShe took a sip of her coffee, but it was still a little too hot, so she set it down.\n\n\"Probably, honestly. I hope you're not unhappy. You've lasted longer here than anyone ever has before.\"\n\nGrant stirred some creamer into his sturdy mug, just happy he had Maxwell House at this point.\n\n\"I honor my commitments. You did outright tell me this place is haunted up front. I just didn't believe you at the time. Have you tried anything to get rid of the ghost?\"\n\nMrs. Hawke said, \"Well, I tried to burn some sage, but it only triggered my asthma. Then, me and my nephew tried to cast the spirit out with a passage from the Bible, but he's an atheist, and I'm agnostic. Our hearts just weren't in it. It was kind of embarrassing, and then the bookmark fell out, so we just kind of left.\"\n\nThis was not extremely helpful.\n\n------\n\nHe met Luka by chance, and couldn't help but want to spend any free moment with her.\n\nGrant thought that Luka was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. Luka thought that crystals and random plants had mystical healing powers. He had finally found someone who believed him. He seemed to spend a lot of time trying to convince her to stop shoving all his garlic in her ears to treat her ear infection, but he was actually really happy dating her.\n\nOne night the ghost was tossing around the furniture, and Luka intervened.\n\n\"Hey, it's ok. Everyone gets angry,\" she said, \"I mean, this morning the dryer tore holes in my favorite leggings, and I was pretty angry. You're damned to wander the earth in eternal torment, and you're pretty angry. I mean, I understand.\"\n\nGrant was shocked when the ghost spoke for the first time, with a bold man's voice.\n\n\"Is this bitch for real?\"\n\nLuka seized the opportunity to open a dialouge, earnestly telling the ghost about the cosmic harmony of the universe, nature, and the importance of feelings and expression.\n\n\"I'm moving in at the end of the month,\" she said, \"and I'm sure we'll be great friends, and talk about these things a lot.\"\n\nAgain, a voice came from nowhere.\n\n\"I'm out.\"\n\nIt took a while for Grant to feel sure that the ghost was gone, but it was never an issue again. Mrs. Hawke brought Luka a vegan carrot cake and expressed her heartfelt gratitude.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "Cabinets clattering, slamming, a cacophony of wooden tongues wagging in the night's maw. Grant's mind, a whirlpool of deadlines and spectral annoyances, swirled incessantly. Ten hours, the clock's hands stretching, reaching, grasping at the future. Words, his weapons against time and phantoms alike, scattered across the battlefield of his desk.\n\n\"Kitchen's closed!\" he bellowed, voice ricocheting off walls and memories. \"Ghostly gluttony begets ectoplasmic adiposity!\" Silence descended, a velvet curtain dropping on the unseen performance.\n\nThe lamp, a fickle firefly, flickered fitfully. On went the overhead light, its harsh glare exposing the chaos of creation. Papers, like fallen leaves in autumn, carpeted the wooden expanse of his desk. Each sheet a world unto itself, waiting to be breathed into life by his fingertips.\n\nMonths of sleepless nights and caffeine-fueled days had stretched Grant's sanity thin as gossamer. The cheap rent, a siren's song luring him to this haunted harbor. Oh, the folly of youth! Student loans for a journalism degree, words bought with future toil.\n\nSkepticism, that stalwart companion of the modern age, barred all but his landlord from believing his spectral tale. Women, fleeting as morning mist, vanished at the first sign of paranormal pranks. Their laughter, echoing in the hollow chambers of his memory, stung more than any ghostly assault.\n\nWords flowed, ebbed, crashed against the shore of his consciousness. Sensationalism tempered, tamed into respectability. The unseen editor, a phantom more terrifying than any bumping in the night, loomed large in his mind's eye.\n\nThree a.m., the witching hour. Article submitted, a digital dove released into the ether. Scotch, amber nectar of forgetfulness, poured into a survivor of ghostly wrath. A knock at the door, sharp as a gunshot in the night's silence.\n\nPolice, blue-clad arbiters of normalcy, stood at the threshold. His article, a scathing indictment of their brutality, surely couldn't have reached them so swiftly? But no, merely a noise complaint, easily dismissed with a white lie about a raucous television.\n\nMorning arrived, sleep a distant memory, a fading dream. Mrs. Hawke, stern visage belying a warm heart, descended from her lofty perch above. The kitchen, a sunny incongruity in this haunted realm, welcomed them. Time ticked away, oblivious to human constructs, waiting patiently for its moment of accuracy.\n\n\"Research ongoing,\" Grant muttered, words tumbling out like dice on a cosmic gaming table. \"Madness and truth, twin serpents entwined in the realm of the supernatural.\"\n\nLuka entered his life, a whirlwind of beauty and belief. Crystals and herbs, her armor against the world's ills. At last, a kindred spirit who saw beyond the veil of reality.\n\nThe ghost raged, furniture flying like leaves in an autumn storm. Luka, serene as a moonlit lake, spoke to the unseen. \"Anger, that primal force, courses through us all. From torn leggings to eternal damnation, we are united in our fury.\"\n\nThe ghost's voice, bold and incredulous, pierced the veil. \"Is this bitch for real?\"\n\nLuka, undeterred, waxed poetic about cosmic harmony and the importance of expression. The ghost, faced with an eternity of new-age platitudes, chose oblivion over enlightenment.\n\n\"I'm out,\" it declared, fading into the ether like mist before the morning sun.\n\nGrant and Luka, united in their oddity, basked in the newfound peace. Mrs. Hawke's vegan carrot cake, a peace offering to the victorious couple, sat on the kitchen table, a sweet testament to the power of belief and the unpredictability of the human heart.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The response successfully transforms the style and tone to a Joycean style, capturing the stream-of-consciousness technique, intricate wordplay, and deep exploration of the character's inner thoughts.
