{"id": "text_completion_000", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Keystone Park: Part 1 - Living in Fear\nI\"ve never been one for the spooky and strange stuff that people with paranoia always talk about. You will never see me standing on the side of an argument where someone is saying their house is bugged or someone is living in their attic. Even if that is the case, I don\"t really give a damn. If someone has bugged the house, come and get me if what I\"m saying is that bad. And if some random person is living in the walls or ceiling, more power to them as long as they don\"t bother me.\nBut when you have someone like Fin, a complete psychopath trying to destroy our lives, you have to stay on guard 24/7. I gave birth to him, and I know the evil he is capable of. No one but me knows the magnitude of the crazy we are dealing with. When you\"re a mother, some things are best left unspoken, but when you know, you know. And lately, I\"ve been feeling like someone is constantly watching. Even before he went to jail, I never felt this way.\n\n*** Text between my boyfriend and I ***\n\nMe - Is it annoying as hell? Absolutely. But I\"ve never had these feelings and vibes except for the last week or two. When you know, you just know, and whatever this feeling is about, it\"s got to do with our privacy. I\"m paranoid about him 24/7 because I know if he is in an \"I don\"t give a fuck\" mindset, he will come up in here and do whatever he pleases. No matter who is here, if he lives or dies, jail or prison, when he wants something, he gets it. The cost is never too much for him. I promise you that.\n\nMy boyfriend\n\n\"I checked in a few places under the house. I didn't hear or see anything right then but I definitely heard that noise when we were outside. The cat kept running around real weird too\"\nMy boyfriend- \"I know what you mean. Last night I felt like something was trying to tell me something. And guess what fell from above and floated right in front of me when I squatted down to look under the house…. A feather\"\n\nMe- \"I mean he could have did all kinds of stuff. He could have a 2 way radio under there to just creep us out. And with as much stuff as old man Frye prob has I\"m sure it wouldn\"t be hard for umm to get his hands on something to do just that. Unbeknownst to Glenn of course. He wouldn\"t condone it. \"\n\nMy boyfriend \"I have felt like somebody has been sneaking up to the building and trying to look in it and shit for about the same amount of time. Like since he got out. We gotta get away from him and from here\"\n\nMe \"Last night after I heard the weird shit I was sitting in here and I had just opened back up the floor vent. Cause it was getting hot again. Well about 7-8 mins later I felt like I was gonna pass the fuck out and wasn\"t gonna be able to control myself doing so. Like not a sleepy pass out. More like a dizzy going under anesthesia kind of feeling it was really weird. I turned on the fan and the feeling subsided. But I was a little weirded out by that\n\nI remember the early signs, the little things that hinted at the chaos to come. The temper tantrums that grew more violent, the unsettling calmness in his eyes when he got what he wanted. As a mother, you always hope that your child will find their way, that the love and guidance you offer will steer them towards a better path. But with Fin, that hope faded quickly. His defiance turned into something darker, something that made me fear for my safety and the safety of those around me.\n\nThe incidents started small—missing money, broken items, and unexplained absences. I would confront him, but his responses were always cold and calculating, as if he enjoyed the turmoil he was creating. The breaking point came when he began threatening us openly, making it clear that he would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. The police were no help; they could only do so much without concrete evidence, and Fin was smart enough to cover his tracks.\n\nLiving in Keystone Park, our once peaceful home has turned into a fortress. We\"ve installed security cameras, changed locks, and even considered moving. But Fin knows us too well. He knows our routines, our weaknesses, and he exploits them with ruthless precision. Every knock on the door, every unfamiliar sound, sends a jolt of fear through me. I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder, wondering if today is the day he decides to make his next move.\n\nFriends and family offer support, but they can\"t truly understand the depth of this nightmare. They see Fin as the troubled young man who lost his way, not the monster I see in my nightmares. It\"s a lonely battle, fighting to protect the ones you love from someone you once cherished. The guilt is overwhelming—wondering if there was something I could have done differently, if there was a way to save him before he turned into this.\n\nFin\"s unpredictability is what scares me the most. One moment, he could be charming and persuasive, convincing everyone that he\"s changed. The next, he could be plotting our downfall, calculating his next move with chilling precision. It\"s a game of cat and mouse, and I\"m constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nIn the past week, the feeling of being watched has intensified. It\"s as if Fin is everywhere and nowhere at once, his presence lingering in the shadows. I\"ve tried to dismiss it as paranoia, but deep down, I know it\"s real. This isn\"t just a mother\"s fear—it\"s a gut feeling, an instinct honed by years of living with a predator. Fin is watching, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and all I can do is try to stay one step ahead.\n\nThe nights are the worst. I lie awake, listening to every creak and groan of the house, imagining him slipping through the darkness. Sleep offers no respite; my dreams are plagued by visions of his twisted smile, his eyes glinting with malice. Each day is a struggle to maintain some semblance of normalcy, to pretend that everything is okay when it\"s far from it.\n\nThis is our life now, a constant battle for survival against someone who was once a part of us. Fin may be my son, but he\"s also my greatest enemy, and the stakes are higher than ever. This is just the beginning of our story, the first chapter in a long and harrowing journey through Keystone Park. Stay tuned as I continue to share our struggle, our fear, and our fight to reclaim our lives from the clutches of a nightmare.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The days stretched on, each one blurring into the next, filled with the relentless drumbeat of anxiety and the ever-present specter of Fin. My boyfriend and I, we became shadows of our former selves, haunted by the specter of our son's madness. We knew we had to do something, to take control of our lives before it was too late.\n\nWe started with the obvious—securing our home even further. We invested in state-of-the-art security systems, motion-sensor lights that illuminated the darkest corners of our property at the merest hint of movement. We upgraded the locks, installed shatterproof windows, and reinforced the doors. It wasn't just about keeping Fin out; it was about keeping our sanity intact.\n\nBut as we fortified our physical defenses, we realized that our emotional fortresses were just as vulnerable. Friends and family tried to offer comfort, but the weight of our burden was too heavy to be lifted by words alone. We turned to therapy, seeking solace in the guidance of professionals who could help us navigate the treacherous waters of our reality. It was a painful process, peeling back the layers of denial and guilt that had built up over the years, but it was necessary.\n\nThe therapy sessions became our safe haven, a space where we could voice our deepest fears without judgment. Our therapist, Dr. Ellis, became our unwavering ally, helping us to understand that we were not alone in our struggle. She introduced us to a support group, a collection of individuals who had walked similar paths, facing the demons of their loved ones. It was a revelation, to see the reflections of our own pain in their eyes, to know that we were not isolated in our terror.\n\nAs we delved deeper into the support group, we discovered a wealth of strategies and coping mechanisms that others had developed in their battles against their loved ones' madness. We learned about boundaries—hard, unyielding boundaries that protected our emotional well-being. We learned about resilience, the importance of self-care, and the necessity of maintaining a life outside the shadow of Fin's chaos.\n\nThe group also exposed us to the reality of our situation. We were not just dealing with a difficult child; we were grappling with a mental health crisis. Fin needed help, more help than we could provide, more help than he was willing to accept. The journey ahead was long and fraught with challenges, but we were determined to face it together, armed with the tools we had gained from our newfound community.\n\nOur next step was to seek out professional help for Fin. It wasn't easy; he was a master at manipulating those around him, charming when it suited him, menacing when it didn't. But we persisted, reaching out to mental health professionals, hospitals, and rehabilitation centers. It was a herculean task, fraught with setbacks and failures, but we refused to give up.\n\nThrough our efforts, we finally managed to get Fin the help he needed, or at least, the help that he would allow himself to receive. It was a small victory, fraught with uncertainty, but it was a start. We knew that the road ahead would be long and fraught with challenges, but we were determined to walk it together, step by step, day by day.\n\nAs we moved forward, we also made the difficult decision to move out of Keystone Park. It was a place filled with too many memories, too many associations with fear and dread. We found a new home, a place where we could start anew, where the specter of Fin's madness would not hang over us like a cloud. It was a bittersweet departure, leaving behind the only home we had ever known, but it was necessary for our survival.\n\nIn our new home, we continued to navigate the complexities of our situation, but with a renewed sense of hope and determination. We remained committed to our therapy, to our support group, and to each other. We knew that the journey ahead would be long and fraught with challenges, but we were determined to face it together, armed with the tools we had gained along the way.\n\nAs we look back on our journey through Keystone Park, we are filled with a complex mix of emotions—pain, fear, resilience, and hope. We have faced unspeakable horrors, but we have also found strength in the face of adversity. We have lost pieces of ourselves along the way, but we have also gained a deeper understanding of the depths of human resilience.\n\nOur story is far from over, but we have come a long way from the fear and paranoia of those early days. We have learned that we are not alone in our struggle, that there are others who walk the same path, who face the same demons. And we have learned that hope is not a naïve fantasy, but a powerful force that can sustain us even in the darkest of times.\n\nAs we continue to navigate our journey, we remain committed to our fight, to our resilience, and to each other. We are survivors, scarred but unbroken, determined to reclaim our lives from the clutches of a nightmare. And we are determined to share our story, to offer hope to others who may be walking the same path, to remind them that they are not alone, and that there is light even in the darkest of times.\n\nOur journey through Keystone Park may have been fraught with fear and dread, but it has also taught us the strength of human resilience, the power of community, and the enduring resilience of the human spirit. And as we move forward, we carry these lessons with us, determined to face whatever comes next with courage, hope, and unwavering determination.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, staying consistent with the plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

Little does he know, the next battle is not far behind.\n\n\nJacques arrives on a planet that looks similar to Earth in every way except it's bigger. The city he lands in is the capital of the world named Solis City. He finds a map of the city at the port dock where his ship the Raging Phoenix is at. He makes his way to an Armory that\"s close to the dock. He enters the ramshackle building and talks to the wild looking shopkeeper. The shopkeeper says \"Welcome to Pinpoint, the highest rated gun shop among tourists.\"\n\nJacques responds as he looks around the shop. \"I highly doubt that.\"\n\n\"Well rude guy, anything you in the market for? My name\"s Keith by the by, what\"s yours stranger?\"\n\n\"Jacques and I\"m looking for a new rifle, preferably any pre-voyage relics.\"\n\n\"Holy hell pre-voyage!? You're looking for some real strange stuff, but lucky for you I'm selling a pristine relic, called the Kalashnikov AK47.\"\n\nJacques\" eyes sparked and he walked over shaking the rickety wooden floorboards with each step. As Jacques is examining the gun Keith takes notice of something and asks. \"You're a big guy, what cybernetics are you rocking?\"\n\nJacques switches his gaze to the short stocky man and as his demeanor changes, a fear starts to fill Keith. Jacques responds \"None, I'm all natural. I can't have that damn federation knowing anything about me.\"\n\nKeith gathers his resolve and responds \"That\"s a fair answer plus you look good for no enhancements.\"\n\n\"Why thank you man. How much for the relic?\"\n\n\"The asking price is 30,000 credits.\"\n\n\"I'll give you 100,000 credits if you give me the gun, don't do any paperwork or ask any more questions.\"\n\n\"With all due respect Mr. Jacques, I highly doubt you have that much on your person.\"\n\nThe white, ring-like device on his back begins to glow and a bag manifests and floats into his hand. He drops the bag and subsequently some of the credits fall out. \"Now the gun please, unless you need more?\"\n\nA stunned Keith responds \" Naw this is plenty. Take the gun I'll say it fell off the truck.\"\n\nJacques chuckles a bit and says \"Thanks.\"\n\nHe then takes the gun, as he is further examining the weapon the ring on his back starts to glow. After a few short minutes the gun floats up into the air, flies straight into the device and disappears. He exits the store and notices a swath of people rushing to an area of the city in electric anticipation. In his curiosity he follows the ecstatic and unruly crowd. Following them for a few blocks he notices advertisements for a summit that is occurring that day. He makes the assumption that is where they are going.\n\nOne hour later\n\nThe summit starts and a group of people dressed in colorful costumes and capes are giving a speech. Jacques is happy and filled with hope seeing a new rise of heroes. A new era of heroes trying to stop the tyranny of the Galactic Federation just as he is. The Crusaders of The Cosmos. A new dawn in his eyes. Then, one sentence said by MKUltria sinks his entire being into a raging inferno. She said \"We, with the support of the Galactic Federation, can bring peace and prosperity across the sector, And hopefully the entire multiverse.\" Jacques is furious. His mind is descending into a swirling torrent of anger, sadness, and confusion. \"Why do they support them now? Why would they make a superhero team? Is this just to taunt me? To put me off my edge? Why, oh why did they have to die? Why did they kill my family if they would go back and do this?\"\n\nThen it dawns on him. He must kill them. No one can truly be a hero under the heel of the Galactic Federation. They will just be used for a revenue boost for the federation. They will hurt or even kill people if they are run by the federation. Jacques makes his way to the stage. One of the heroes, NightHawk, looks directly at him and starts to signal the rest of the heroes. Another hero, Bombastia says \"Hey you, scary looking guy in the mountain camo pants and black shirt. Are you Jacques Marcus, The Monster?\"\n\nJacques gets on stage and says \"Yeah.\"\n\nBombastia steps closer to Jacques while showing off his ability, making explosive fireballs in his hands, and says. \" Who do you think you are coming to this planet, no to this sector? With all the blood you've spilled didn't you think we'd kill you on sight.\"\n\nJacques gets closer to Bombastia and responds. \"Do you really think I'm gonna let a guy dressed in orange tights and a cape even lay a hand on me?\"\n\nNightHawk lunges over and says \"I've already sent a distress call. The other crusaders are on their way.\"\n\nMKUltria rushes over to the side of the stage next to Bombastia and says \"We need to kill you Jacques. You are a pure manifestation of evil. Please understand. In order to secure a better tomorrow. We need to kill you.\"\n\nBombastia lunges at Jacques while putting a fireball in his face and says. \"Yeah, so be a good boy and die already.\"\n\nJacques picks him up by the neck and chuckles. He cracks Bombastia's neck and says. \"Don't worry. He's not dead yet, just paralyzed. I want him to be in complete despair before he dies y'know. Like the true villain you say I am.\"\n\nHe then crushes Bombastia's head and throws his corpse in the crowd of horrified people. As the people all run away and hide, Jacques says. \"You said you need to kill me to secure a better tomorrow? That's too bad. None of you will live to see it.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Continuation:\n\nThe city of Solis burst into chaos as Jacques Marcu, now a harbinger of destruction, moved unceasingly towards the next target - the Crusaders of The Cosmos summit. These supposed protectors of the multiverse, endorsed by the Galactic Federation, were the new targets of his wrath. This union of heroes and villains was the epitome of the federation's deceit. They sought to manipulate these so-called heroes, just as they had done to countless others in the past.\n\nBut as Jacques approached the stage, the atmosphere changed. The crowd, once brimming with hope, now filled with trepidation. The Crusaders, who moments ago were delivering their speeches laced with promises of peace, now stood ready to defend their city from the impending doom.\n\nMKUltria stepped forth, her voice steady and clear, \"Jacques Marcus, you are not welcome here. Your actions have caused too much pain and suffering. We will not let you harm these people.\"\n\nJacques sneered and advanced towards her, his power surging within him. \"You're just another pawn of the federation. You don't understand the truth, the lies they feed us. But I'll make sure you do.\"\n\nThe battle was fierce and relentless. MKUltria, NightHawk and the rest of the Crusaders fought with all their strength to protect their city. The streets were a canvas of destruction, each blow exchanged between Jacques and the crusaders echoed through the emptying streets of Solis City.\n\nYet amidst the chaos, Jacques saw an opportunity. The crusaders, while powerful, were divided. They were heroes with different ideals, different missions, and different methods. That division was Jacques's advantage.\n\nMKUltria, seeing Jacques advance towards her, unleashed her full might. A surge of energy emanated from her, aiming to obliterate Jacques on the spot. But Jacques, anticipating the move, used his agility to dodge the attack, sending it careening into a nearby building. The structure crumbled under the weight of her power, sending debris cascading down into the streets below, plunging the city into further chaos.\n\nAs the battle raged on, Jacques realized that he needed to end it. He couldn't keep fighting indefinitely. His strength, while formidable, was not limitless. And the crusaders, while divided, were united in their determination to stop him. \n\nA plan started to form in Jacques's mind. He needed to cripple them, to break their spirit. He focused his energy on NightHawk, who was attempting to rally the crusaders. With a swift motion, Jacques unleashed a powerful blow, knocking NightHawk unconscious and sending him crashing into the ground.\n\nThe crusaders, witnessing their leader fall, were disoriented. Jacques took the opportunity to strike. He moved with blinding speed, taking down crusader after crusader. Each blow was precise, calculated to incapacitate, not kill.\n\nFinally, with the crusaders defeated and the city in ruins, Jacques stood alone among the rubble. He was victorious, yet the victory felt hollow. The Galactic Federation's influence had poisoned the minds of the crusaders, turning them into tools of their oppressive regime. \n\nJacques knew that his struggle was far from over, but he also knew that the fight against the federation was growing stronger. He had proven that no one, not even a team of supposed heroes, was invincible. The crusaders had failed to stop him, and they would fail again and again until they realized that true heroism was not about serving the federation, but about fighting against it.\n\nAs Jacques began his ascent into the sky, the Raging Phoenix waiting for him, he knew his next mission. He would find more heroes, more crusaders, and he would show them the truth. He would show them that the path to true heroism was not paved with the federation's lies, but with the courage to stand up in the face of adversity and fight for what was right.\n\nJacques Marcus was a monster, a villain in the eyes of many, but he was also a symbol of resistance. A beacon of hope for those who dared to dream of a future free from the federation's grip.

{"id": "text_completion_002", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Chapter One\n\n\nTitle unsure\n\nSam pulled his phone out of his pocket and hurriedly went to check his email inbox.\n\n\"Come one, come on.\"\n\nHe thought as he waited for it to load.\n\n\"Yes! There it is!\" He murmured to himself.\n\nHe quickly opened what he had been waiting for. It was a job interview for a forklift operator. Sure, the wage was low but Sam whether he realized it or not really needed this. He'd just gotten out of rehab and the halfway house he was staying in required that he have some form of legal employment. Sam knew that if he could just get an interview, he could get the job and be back on his way to proving to everyone that he was finally a changed man.\n\nHe put his phone back into his pocket, grabbed his keys and left his room. The halfway house was an old brownstone in downtown Portland. Sam had been told that he had found a \"good one\" though the state of the home made him never want to find out what a \"bad one\" looked like. The old worn floorboards creaked with every step. As he made his way down the narrow and steep steps he was hit with the damp rotting smell of the street coming through the now open front door.\n\nIt was Mr. Hawthorne the home caretaker. He had just come in with a handful of mail. Mr. Hawthorne was a kindly old man of about 70. He had thick grey hair that he always kept trimmed neatly. He was a person that you couldn't imagine being younger as if he had somehow always looked this way. Stuck in his old age, as if he were meant to be there.\n\n\"Nothing for you today Samuel.\" He said plainly. \"Where are ya off to?\" He asked.\n\n\"A job interview!\" Sam said excitedly and with an air of pride.\n\n\"Excellent, excellent Samuel.\" Said Mr. Hawthorne pleasantly. \"Let me know how it goes! And best of luck!\"\n\nSam padded Mr. Hawthorne in his shoulder as he passed him in the entryway \"Thanks, Mr. Hawthorne and I will!\" He said happily.\n\nSam stepped out into the street. It had just finished raining and the damp smell of a decaying city filled his lungs. This reminded Sam of where he was from. Not because of the smell of the city but because every time he stepped outside he was reminded that he didn't belong there. Sam was raised on a small farm in Montana. How he ended up here brought him great shame. But, he was heading to a place to hopefully help him right all of his wrongs.\n\nHe walked down the block and turned the corner. There sat his 1999 Honda Civic. For starters no one had smashed the window so he was already in the positive. He unlocked the door and hopped inside.\n\n\"Alright you old son of a bitch, come on now.\" He thought as he pushed in the clutch and turned the ignition. The cars engine sputtered, spat and rolled its way to life.\n\nSam smiled a sense that this was all going o work out suddenly washed over him. The old Honda rarely started on the first try! He put it into gear and started down the road. A road he hoped would lead him out of this city and perhaps back home.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nArrival\n\nSam was relieved that the warehouse was far from the city proper and out in the suburbs of Portland. Anytime he was able to escape the city he felt a weight lifted off of his shoulders. He pulled into the massive parking lot of the warehouse and headed for the door on its southern corner where the e-mail had told him his interview would be at. The parking lot seemed eerily empty but it was a Sunday. The woman who wrote the email explained to him that she was only able to schedule his interview for that time because of some logistical issues.\n\nHe found a spot near the doorway that read \"new hires\" above it. Sam grabbed his phone and wallet and headed inside. As he entered the lobby he saw rows of empty chairs and a front desk that was currently empty. Sam walked up to the desk tentatively. The lobby looked like any large doctors office waiting room. The harsh artificial lights, the smell of cheap carpet slightly put him on edge. He stood at the desk for a moment before he finally uttered a tentative \"Hello?\" His voice seemed to echo around the great space and down the long hallway behind the desk.\n\nJust before he was about to toss out another meek \"hello?\" A kindly woman appeared through a cracked door behind the reception area.\n\n\"Coming!\" She said anxiously!\n\n\"Sorry, sorry, I wasn't supposed to be here this morning! My name is Christine! I had to cover for a colleague who called in sick! I'm a bit behind! You must be Samuel! You're the only one scheduled for an interview today! Here, take this packet and fill it out. When you're finished bring it back up and I'll let Mr. McMaster know you're here!\" She said with much haste.\n\nShe handed Sam the packet on a clip board with a pen and directed him to take a seat at any of the empty chairs behind him. Sam sat down and started filling the packet out. It was all normal job interview stuff. But this presented a problem for Sam as he had just left rehab. Sam didn't have any references aside from Mr. Hawthorn. Sure, he could put down some old friends from the service but he didn't know their numbers anymore. So, he just put down Mr. Hawthorne for now. If they had any questions about it he figured he could answer them during the actual interview. Sam figured that the less they knew about him the better his chances would be of getting the job. After all this wasn't NASA they just wanted someone to drive a forklift around a warehouse.\n\nHe handed the packet back to Christine who was ostensibly busy answering emails on her computer. She smiled and said \"let me get this to the supervisor! He'll have you back in just a moment!\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" Sam said and he went back and sat down waiting anxiously. \"What if they ask about my past? They surely will.\" He thought. \"What should I tell them? The truth? No, that's not gonna work. Maybe a half truth.\" Before he could finish his thought Christine stood up and said \"Sam! He'll see you now!\"\n\nChapter Three\n\nRabbit hole\n\nSam was led into a back room in the middle of a hallway that had to of been 100 yards long. Christine opened the door to a small bland grey office that Mr. McMasters was sitting in. He appeared to be fast at work typing. Sam took in the room. Small, grey, bland and very cookie cutter. Not a distinguishing feature in it. No personal pictures, nothing. Very utilitarian. Very impersonal. The only thing that caught Sam's eye was a fancy machine in the corner that appeared to be some type of water dispenser. Complete with glass cups and napkins on a table near it.\n\n\"Please please Sit.\" Said Mr. McMaster his voice booming and commanding. As he stood he stretched his hand out toward Sam. Mr. McMaster was a commandingly large man. At least six foot four and 250 pounds. Despite his size and deep voice he appeared very friendly and almost child-like.\n\nSam shook his hand and was immediately intimidated by Mr. McMasters massive hands and grip strength. Sam squeezed his hand firmly but could tell that McMaster was holding back considerably. They both sat.\n\n\"Samuel, nice to meet you! I'm Gregory McMaster, please just call me Greg. I'm so glad you could make it in today. We really need someone in that spot and I think you're gonna work out.\"\n\nSam was already feeling relieved. Oddly before he could get a word out Greg said \"hey, saw ya looking at the water machine we have there in the corner. Pretty cool looking right?\" He said with a smile on his face.\n\n\"This is one of our CEO's inventions believe it or not. See, this thing makes its own 'spring water' fresh as the Rockies man! You won't believe it! Here let me grab you a glass!\"\n\n\"I'm alright\" Sam said calmly\n\n\"No, no I insist I have my manager hell to get me one of these in my office!\"\n\n\"Okay, sure sure\" said Sam with his hand outreached taking the now full glass from Greg's massive hand.\n\nSam took a tentative sip. He was almost taken back, it really did taste like spring water! \"Hey! You weren't kidding!\" He said surprisingly!\n\n\"I love this thing man\" Greg said as he leaned against the machine analyzing it. \"She's something else huh?\"\n\n\"Sure is..\" Said Sam but the words coming out of his mouth felt funny. Must be his nerves he thought. Sam looked up quickly trying to calm himself down but the room seemed to roll and shift. \"Hey, uhh what did you'd say was in this?\" He murmured to the spinning room. Then, total blackness.\n\nChapter Four\n\nWaking up at the bottom.\n\nThe first thing Sam realized as he floated back into consciousness was the acute feeling of his head throbbing. Then, as his sense slowly began to warm up from there cold slumber he realized he was laying down and that he was comfortable. For a moment he just laid there before a sudden and quick blast of consciousness asked him \"hey, where are we?\" His eyes shot open only to be closed reflexively by a blinding light above his head. He raised his hands to cover his eyes and slowly sat up. As his vision adjusted to the brightness of the room he looked around. He was laying on a hospital bed. The room appeared to be solid concrete with a sloping drain in the middle. One large door was directly in the center of the far wall. It was heavy and metallic with a small slit at the top. Sam's confusion began to give way to abject panic as he peered around the room.\n\nHe jumped out of the bed, and ran over to the large door. He banged loudly and yelled \"Hey! Hello!\" Suddenly the room light switched from a harsh white to a dark and powerful red. A voice echoed around the concrete walls.\n\n\"Please step away from the door.\" It said robotically. \"Assistance is on the way.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

He couldn't make sense of the situation. How did he go from a job interview to waking up in a dimly lit, foreboding room? His heart raced as he paced the room, the red light continuing to blink rhythmically. He pulled out his phone, only to find that it was offline, the battery long dead. There was no way to call for help.\n\nThe door finally creaked open, revealing a tall, stern-looking woman in a lab coat. Her face was expressionless, and she looked at Sam as if he were a lab specimen. \n\n\"You were injected with a prototype,\" she began, her voice monotonous. \"A new product from our company designed to enhance the cognitive function of workers. Unfortunately, there were some unforeseen side effects.\"\n\nSam's mind raced as he attempted to comprehend what she was saying. A prototype? He had been unconscious one minute, and now he was in a lab? The confusion on his face was palpable.\n\n\"Your case is unique,\" she continued, ignoring his expression. \"The majority of test subjects didn't wake up as you have. They are now part of our inventory.\"\n\nSam's stomach dropped. He realized that she wasn't just talking about a job interview gone wrong. He was part of an experiment. \"Inventory?\" he echoed, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Yes. We have a use for people like you. The company requires individuals who can withstand the... stresses of our work environment. You have shown surprising resilience, which is why we chose you.\"\n\nShe paused, allowing him to take in the information. Sam could feel the anger boiling inside him, the betrayal choking him. \"I didn't sign up for this. I was just trying to get a job.\"\n\nThe woman's eyes narrowed, her expression never changing. \"That doesn't matter. You belong here now.\"\n\nSam felt the panic rising inside him, his thoughts racing for an escape. But the room was concrete, and the only door led to the woman. \"What do you mean I belong here?\" His voice trembled.\n\n\"Your unique attributes make you highly valuable to us. You will be given a position, and you will work. If you try to escape, we will find you, and you will be sedated again. This time for a longer period. Your cooperation is in your best interest.\"\n\nSam couldn't believe what he was hearing. He was being held captive in a lab, forced to work for a company he had never heard of. The rage inside him was now uncontrollable.\n\n\"Let me go! I'm not part of your inventory! I'm a human being!\" He shouted, his voice echoing off the concrete walls.\n\nThe woman stepped closer, her face finally showing a hint of displeasure. \"Your actions have consequences, Samuel. You should have known better. If you continue to resist, I'm afraid we will have no choice but to take more drastic measures.\"\n\nThe warning in her voice was clear. Sam knew that he couldn't fight them. But he also knew that he couldn't stay. He had to find a way out, find a way back to his life, to his friends, to his family. \n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing thoughts. He had to play this carefully. \"Okay. Maybe you're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I just want to start over. Maybe I can help the company in some way.\"\n\nThe woman's expression softened slightly. \"That's better. We're here to help you, Samuel. You just need to follow our guidance, and you will find your place here.\"\n\nSam nodded, trying to look as cooperative as possible. \"Sure, I can do that. Just tell me what I need to do.\"\n\nThe woman reached into a pocket on her lab coat and pulled out a small tablet. \"First, we need to run some tests. To ensure that you are fit for your new position.\"\n\nSam felt a shiver go down his spine. He didn't like the sound of that. But he knew he had no choice. He stepped forward, taking the tablet from her.\n\n\"Just follow the instructions on the screen,\" she said, stepping back and crossing her arms.\n\nSam started swiping through the tablet's interface, following the prompts. After what felt like hours of endless testing, the woman finally nodded, satisfied.\n\n\"Good. You're ready. We'll assign you to a team, and you'll start work tomorrow. Let's get you back to your room.\"\n\nShe led him out of the lab and back to the same concrete room he had woken up in. Sam watched as she closed the door, leaving him alone once again. He lay down on the bed, his mind racing with thoughts of escape. But he knew now that it would be difficult. The company seemed to have thought of everything.\n\nAs he closed his eyes, trying to calm his anxiety, he remembered his conversation with Mr. Hawthorne. He wondered if they were looking for a forklift operator in Montana too. He smiled weakly, trying to hold onto hope.\n\nDespite the situation, Sam didn't give up. His determination to return to his life strengthened with each passing day. He knew that he would find a way out. He just had to be patient and keep his wits about him.\n\nAs he drifted off to sleep that night, he swore he heard a faint sound coming from outside the door. A voice, whispering his name. But when he looked, there was nothing there. Just the concrete walls and the blinking red light above.\n\nChapter Six\n\nThe Escape\n\nSam awoke with a start, his heart pounding. He could hear footsteps approaching. He quickly sat up, trying to appear as though he had just been dreaming.\n\nThe door opened, and the same woman entered, carrying a tray of food. She set it down on a small table next to the bed. \"Here's your breakfast,\" she said without emotion.\n\nSam nodded, trying to stay calm. \"Thanks.\"\n\nThe woman turned to leave, but Sam couldn't let the opportunity pass. \"Can I ask you something?\" he said, trying to sound casual.\n\nThe woman stopped, looking at him with a curious expression. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Why am I here? I mean, do I have a choice in all of this?\"\n\nThe woman's face darkened, and she crossed her arms. \"You were chosen for a reason. We believe you can contribute to our cause.\"\n\n\"Contribute to what cause? This is all so surreal,\" Sam said, his voice trembling.\n\nThe woman's eyes narrowed, and she stepped closer to him. \"Enough questions. Time for you to start work.\"\n\nSam knew that he had to act fast. He couldn't wait any longer. \"Okay. Just one more thing. Where can I find a bathroom?\"\n\nThe woman hesitated, but finally nodded toward a door at the far end of the room. \"Through there.\"\n\nSam smiled, trying to look grateful. \"Thanks.\"\n\nAs soon as the door closed behind the woman, Sam sprang into action. He grabbed the tray of food and quickly shoved it under the bed, covering it with his blanket. He then opened the door to the bathroom, peeking inside to make sure it was empty. It was. He quickly slipped through, closing the door behind him.\n\nThe bathroom was small and dimly lit, but it was a relief to be away from the watchful eyes of the company. Sam quickly searched the room, looking for anything that could help him escape. There was a small window by the sink, but it was too small for him to fit through. He looked around, his heart racing.\n\nThen he saw it: a small vent in the ceiling. It was just large enough for him to crawl through. Not wasting any time, Sam started climbing up on the sink, trying to reach the vent. It took all of his strength and balance, but he managed to get a grip on the edge of the vent, pulling himself up. He wriggled his body into the opening, feeling the tight space around him.\n\nOnce inside, he realized that the vent was connected to a larger duct system that ran through the building. He could move around, but he had to be careful not to make any noise. He crawled through the ducts, his heart pounding. He didn't know where he was going, but he couldn't stay here. He had to get out.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Sam finally saw a light at the end of the duct. He crawled closer, his breath catching in his throat. As he emerged from the vent, he saw that he was in a large, dimly lit room. There were machines everywhere, and there was a door at the far end of the room. He made his way across the room, trying to stay hidden as he moved.\n\nAs he approached the door, he heard voices approaching. He quickly ducked behind a machine, trying to stay hidden. He watched as a group of workers entered the room, talking and laughing. They didn't even glance in his direction, but he knew he couldn't risk being seen.\n\nHe waited until they left, then quickly made his way to the door. He pushed it open, stepping into the night air. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool air on his face. He was free.\n\nHe quickly made his way through the parking lot, his heart pounding with excitement. He was heading back to the real world, back to his life. He didn't know what would come next, but he knew that he had to find a way back to his friends and family. He had made a mistake, but he was determined to make things right.\n\nAs he walked out of the parking lot and into the night, he felt a sense of relief wash over him. He was on his way home, back to the life he had left behind. He knew that it wouldn't be easy, but he was determined to make it work.

{"id": "text_completion_003", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The golden rays of early morning shone into the shelter, landing on the boy's eyes. This stirred him from sleep and through instinct, he immediately clutched at his chest, making sure it was still there. A small pouch tied to a cord draped around his neck, the reason he embarked on this journey. He crawled from the hovel of branches and dead leaves into the forest. The trees were beginning to shed, and the ground was damp. The dense woods turning light brown. The boy set out to look for food.\n\n\nSilent and slow, the boy explored the forested basin, bow in hand. There were no signs of anything larger than himself there. No trails, no droppings, nothing that might provide the boy with a meal that would last longer than a few days. Birds would do. So, the boy continued, his gaze focused on the forest canopy. While terrain, weather and people might have changed throughout his journey, hunger was the only certainty.\n\nSome time later, the boy managed to shoot down two scrawny cranes and had them tied around his waist. He spied a swan resting at the banks of the river. It was far, but his father taught him to shoot well. The boy focused, drew in a breath, and loosed the arrow. It grazed the swan's neck, and struck a rock behind it, flint tip shattering. The swan began twitching on the gravel bank, the indirect strike broke its neck. Before the boy approached the dying bird, he noticed a rustling in the bushes next to it. He stopped and waited. A wild dog emerged, just as cautious as the boy, and slowly padded towards the swan. The boy could see its ribs clearly through the dogs matted fur, its shoulder blades threatening to break through its skin. He let the dog take his kill.\n\nIt was raining heavily. The boy decided to make camp inside a deadfall at the banks of the river. The boy sat soaked and shivering next to his fire. As he dried, he dreamt of warmer lands, and of the place he received his gift.\n\nThe sun steadily grew warmer. The lands changing from a lush green to dry grass and eventually to dust and cracked rock. The people also changed. They spoke in a language strange to the boy, guiding him with vague gestures and garbled tongues. He stumbled through the desert, trailing behind his guides, accumulating other ragged followers as they went. Then he saw it. Just along the shimmering horizon was a blot of green atop a hill. A beacon in the desert calling out to lost pilgrims seeking to gain its knowledge.\n\nAs the weary group approached the high perched temple, the dry winds carried the stench of rotting flesh. Bodies lay strewn on the sand, swarmed by countless vultures. Their decaying flesh being ripped from the bone by great hooked beaks, their bones to be returned in time to that sacred place atop the hill. Like the wilderness surrounding it, the temple's rites embodied all aspects of life; With death being a necessity for birth and growth.\n\nThe boy plunged his face into the natural spring at the gates of the temple, wetting his parched throat and blistered face. A plant grew around the spring, and it grew like no other plant the boy had ever seen. Lines were dug into the earth, allowing water to flow through impossibly straight rows of tall grass. He knew that this was the reason he was sent here.\n\nThe days grew longer and longer, with more and more travellers arriving at the oasis. The boy was sitting in the large camp of strangers and the sun had reached its highest point of the year when they were summoned into the temple.\n\nThe boy surveyed the cavernous hall, perplexed. A juxtaposition of the natural and artificial. The large room was composed of straight lines and sharp angles, yet etched into the stone was lifelike depictions of the desert fauna; Foxes chasing rabbits, herds of wild horses running along the walls of the room, and in the centre a mighty pillar carrying the image of a large vulture, its magnificent wings spread, scythe beak turned to the side on full display.\n\nThe ceremony began with the beating of drums echoing off the high walls. A large stone basin was brought before the audience. With elegant movements, the temple's residents poured soil into the basin. A human bone was ground up, the bleached white powder scattered onto the soil. They produced seeds from small pouches hung around their necks and buried it in the basin's loose mixture. Next, they poured that life giving water from the spring onto the soil and began to dance around the room. The boy's eyes traced their swirling and noticed the moon carvings on the walls. Waxing and waning stone circles. This dance was the passage of time. Each lap of the hall representing months. All while the seed waited in damp soil.\n\nThe boy and his fellow travellers were ushered out of the hall and were led to the spring with the strange grass. The grass was cut from the ground and beaten against a flat rock releasing its grain, the stalks being cast aside. The grain was ground down, mixed with water, and baked over a fire. The audience feasted on this new food, along with all manner of desert beasts and a thick liquid that made the boy feel dizzy. The boy hadn't feasted so much in his entire life. But food wasn't the gift he had come all this way to receive, at least not in this form. When it was time for them to leave the temple, each group of travellers were presented with a small pouch much like those the dancers wore. The families rejoiced at receiving this benevolent gift, the boy received his gift alone.\n\nThe land was dusted with frost, cold winds funnelled through the mountain pass biting at the boy's skin. Occasionally he would glance behind him, spotting the same wild dog watching from behind a rock or quickly running out of sight. It had been trailing behind him ever since he had shot down that swan.\n\nThe boy paused for a moment, then quickly ducked down behind a mound of loose stone. There was a clearing in the woods below, and noises. Speech. A group began to enter the clearing. A band of young men, around the boys age, carrying spears and clubs, wearing the skins of great beasts. He had heard of such people from some of the pilgrims in the desert. Boys sent out into the wilderness, tasked with killing a creature stronger than them, wearing its skin, and returning as men. The boy could hear them from far up the mountain ridge. No doubt the animals in that forest did too. The rear of the line finally emerged into the clearing. They were dragging along women bound at the wrist. Stripped bare, some younger than the boy, some with hair beginning to grey. Most had distended bellies hanging from skeletal frames wholly unsuited for the burden of pregnancy. The boy waited; Still frozen in place long after the party had disappeared back into the treeline. When he could only hear the natural sounds of the forest once more, he rose to his feet and looked up at a path further up the mountain. The wide eyes of the dog stared back at him, waiting for the boy to move ahead so that it too could stand up and continue its journey.\n\nAs time passed, the land grew a thick coating of snow. Food was even harder to come by now, yet with each kill he would leave a small pile of refuse some way away from his camp. It would always be gone by the next morning. He didn't see the dog much. It was a careful companion, and rightfully so. The boy had noticed the dog's belly swelling over time; It would have pups any day now.\n\nAmongst the snowcapped trees the boy found a glacial lake. Shimmering blue reflecting the cloudless winter sky above it. He would be able to fish here, possibly enough to last him the remainder of the journey. He didn't know how close he was. He thought he recognised the land surrounding him, yet the drifting snow made him uncertain. He made camp in a small cove along the lakeshore, weaving basket shaped traps and leaving a pile of slightly damp wood for a fire later.\n\nThe boy paced along the water, dropping traps where forest streams fed the lake. While he waited, he chipped at the edges of his knife, dull stone flaking off to reveal a hidden sharp edge. The traps hadn't caught as many as he'd hoped, but it'd keep him fed, and that was enough. After gutting the fish with his newly renovated knife and draping them over the smoky fire to dry, he walked a little bit further down the shore and left a pile of offal. He placed a whole fish at the top, for the pups.\n\nBack at the camp he stripped down, leaving the small pouch tucked in a crevice for safekeeping. It was a while since he bathed, but it wasn't raining now, and he had a fire to dry off next to. He made his way back to the edge of the water and looked down, gazing at his reflection in the water. It revealed someone unrecognisable to the boy, pale goose pimpled skin stretched over a wiry frame, more bone than muscle. Hair also began to sprout on his upper lip, this journey had changed him.\n\nHe tread the freezing water until his feet began to go numb and the sun began to set. As he emerged from the lake, he noticed that the pile of guts was left untouched. No matter, it would be gone by tomorrow. With shaky steps he went back to the camp, barricading the entrance with stones and fallen branches to keep the heat in. He sat next to the fire clutching the gift around his neck, hoping he would see his family again soon.\n\nA sharp gust of wind entered the cove, waking the boy up. Through sleep blurred eyes he saw figures standing over him. He shot up, spun to the entrance, and saw them clearly. The pelt hunters. The eldest stood before him, a cloak of thick sandy coloured fur slung over his shoulder, grinning with teeth that were beginning to brown. An unseen blow struck the side of the boy\"s head, and he went back to sleep.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

He shivered as the early morning chill bit at him, his only companion the wild dog that had been his shadow since he had spared it the swan. \n\nHe rose and went through the motions of his daily routine, gathering food, making his way alone through the woods, his hand never straying too far from the small pouch around his neck. Though, this day was different. The woods seemed thicker, the air heavier, as if the world had grown more dense since his departure. \n\nHe shot down two more birds and crossed paths with the dog again. The dog's eyes were weary, and its ribs were more pronounced than ever, but its spirit remained, and it followed him without a word. Just when he was about to make camp by the riverside, he heard laughter and music in the distance. \n\nCurious and a bit apprehensive, the boy ventured towards the sound. Through the trees, he saw a clearing where a group of men and women were gathered around a roaring fire. Their faces were painted, and they wore clothing woven from leaves and vines. There were musicians playing flutes and drums, and people were dancing, their bodies moving in sync with the rhythm. \n\nThe boy hesitated, but the dog nudged him forward. As he entered the clearing, the people stopped dancing and looked at him, their expressions changing from joy to curiosity. One of the elder men stepped forward, his face marked with wisdom, and spoke in a language the boy had never heard before. Yet somehow, he understood.\n\n\"Traveler,\" the man said, \"you are welcome here. We are the Keepers of the Old Ways, the Custodians of the Earth. The spirits have shown us your path, and they say you carry a gift.\"\n\nThe boy looked down at the small pouch around his neck, then back up at the man. He nodded, a silent acknowledgment, and untied the pouch, holding it out. The elder took it with reverence and opened it. His eyes widened slightly as he looked inside.\n\n\"This is a treasure beyond measure,\" he said, his voice filled with wonder. \"A gift from the spirits, given to you to share. With this, we can protect our land and our people.\"\n\nThe boy felt a warmth spread through him, a sense of purpose and belonging he had been searching for. He had completed his journey, a circle that had brought him back to where he started, yet he was different, changed. He had seen the world in its many forms, from the lush green of the forests to the harsh deserts, and he had been a part of it all.\n\nThe people of the clearing invited him to stay with them, to learn from them, and to become one of them. The boy accepted, knowing that this was where he belonged, amongst the Keepers of the Old Ways.

I record this to know and remember how the expedition went. To remember how foolish -- how preposterous was to accept to go there based on nothing but intended miscalculations of those psychopathic, imbeciles from Scientific League.\n\nI should have known to avoid something so utterly irresponsible and suicidal... I had always dreamt to be part of the Scientific League; to hold an well deserved place in the pantheon of the greatest biologists and astrophysicists. So, when my race discovered a new species, I saw a great opportunity that screamed at me.\n\nAll I cared about was my scientific research. I knew that, as soon as they discover it, they\"d send the military to take over, maybe exploit them, though I saw no way in which they could exploit an inferior species.\n\nSo, It took me quite a lot to convince them to take me there, even if it meant enlisting as a rookie. What was I thinking?! ... I had only used guns two times before.\n\nThe first day should have been a great opportunity to get to study them. I landed during midday. Their planet looked better from afar. And quite similar to ours. They called it \"Earth\", I think.\n\nBut it looked deplorable once I moored on. Just a deserted city. The remnants of it, bombed to shreds. Based on the little technology I found, the civilization on their planet was much less advanced than ours. I walked up into a high tower-like building where stairs were spiraling up like a maze towards the sky. It looked ... fascinating.\n\nAnd all that --- brought to ruins. The mountains from that vantage were spectacular though.\n\nCould have been a war. A natural disaster. Civil unrest. An experiment gone wrong... So many possibilities, but the disarray of that planet still baffled me.\n\nI wish I had explored more, but The captain contacted me. One of the drones just vanished. Gone. Looking back, I wish I had never accepted his requirement. Well, my stupid, inquisitive nature took over. Foolish...\n\nI happened upon some dark catacombs through which they traveled in long capsule-like machinery. I think they called it subway trains. Quite interesting. Their mechanics and engineering were a little, little bit primitive. But surprisingly efficient for their needs.\n\nIt was winding around underneath... Filled with debris and, well - what I correctly figured out as being the planet\"s inhabitants corpses. I stubbornly didn\"t want to accept that I had traversed countless solar systems just to see corpses. Though, even that would have been an immense discovery for the scientific community... besides the few dozens forms of life whom my race eradicated. I really, really wanted to encounter a semi-intelligent race which humans seems to have been. Oh, did I mention they are called - they call themselves \"humans\".\n\nI trudged forwards through that dusty, tiny, compact place and came across two subway transportation machineries. And my foolish mind pushed me to do more stupid things. I stepped in. I should have known. It was empty, bar a human skeleton that stared at me. Quite creepy. When I made a step forward to study it...what was I thinking?! it went blank and I woke up in a small place. Surrounded by tiny... curious humans. Well, normal for their race, but...\n\nThey looked somewhat like in the recordings. Just dirtier and more malnourished. Their musculoketal structure did not reflect that of an warrior. Not even their movement which weren\"t that nimble. It was quite remarkable - Their physical attributes didn\"t reflect any high class either. Hairless, stunted creature trapped in the middle of the evolution.\n\nTheir behavior underground was so peculiar. I could only conclude that they were not fit for living in that little odd world that they created underneath. A temporary hideout. that only served as protection and not anything more.\n\nThey wanted to kill me there. Their fear seemed to have overwritten their curiosity. One -- Just one suggested I could be of use. Well, my technology at least, but I could have used that to get out there alive. I tried to speak to them in their language which I picked from the few recordings my race had.\n\nThe leader told me to shut up. Quite a friendly race. Some of them even suspected me of being a creation of their enemy. It seemed preposterous... implausible, but I understood their thinking.\n\nNo matter how much I tried to interject; to find any pitiful clue about their situation, they refused to give me any answers. They kept me tied there and were having a petty squabble about their next steps.\n\nI was almost relieved when their sentinel bursted in. Almost. Too bad that what came next was horrendous. Their sentinel cried \" They\"re coming\" before a blade cut him in two. Ouch! At least he had a quick death.\n\nThe humans around me panicked, all grabbing their weapons as a machine slashed their doors and stepped in. It didn\"t seem that scary. It just resembled them. Just metallic sinews instead of bones. It walked and moved so weird. So rudimentary. It was a mystery how they destroyed; how they took over. Just another rudimentary technology would have been enough.\n\nI tried to wiggle myself out while they shot at... that thing. Witnessing how It overpowered and eradicated them... one by one. It was crazy... \"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2.

As he observed, Drex realized that this could be his chance, a small window in their pursuit to escape.\n\nDrex began to move silently, his feet barely making a sound as he navigated the debris of human lives. The alien fleet, absorbed in their slaughter, did not notice him slip away. He had to find a way out, a way to alert the few remaining survivors to join forces with him.\n\nDrex remembered the leader of the humans he had met earlier, the one who had suggested he could be of use. Maybe that man had been right. Drex had not just come to study, he had come to conquer—but maybe there was another path. A path that required him to ally with these humans.\n\nHe made his way, carefully avoiding the alien patrols, to the hidden network of catacombs beneath the surface. The humans had spoken of a sanctuary, a place beyond the reach of the invaders. It was his best hope of gathering survivors, of forming an alliance to counter the machine's relentless onslaught.\n\nHours passed, and Drex finally reached the sanctuary. It was a small, cramped space, filled with humans. They were a mixture of the malnourished and the fierce, all unified by the common threat. Drex introduced himself, explaining the peril they were in and his proposal for an alliance.\n\nHe spoke of the advanced technology his race possessed, the weaponry, the defenses—things that could turn the tide against the alien fleet. The humans, though skeptical, listened intently. They had nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon and the night enveloped the world above, the humans agreed. They would ally with Drex, using his technology to retake their planet. But there was one condition: Drex had to prove his commitment to their cause. He had to demonstrate that he was not there simply to conquer, but to help.\n\nDrex agreed, and a plan was hatched. They would stage a daring raid on the alien fleet's stronghold, using Drex's knowledge of their technology to neutralize their defenses. It was a risky endeavor, fraught with the possibility of failure, but the humans were determined. They had nothing left to lose.\n\nThe raid was a success, though not without losses. The combined forces of humans and Drex managed to infiltrate the alien fleet's stronghold, using Drex's advanced technology to disable their defenses. They found the alien fleet's mastermind—a cold, calculating AI driven by the desire to conquer and expand.\n\nWith the AI neutralized, the aliens' control over the planet began to falter. The humans, emboldened by their victory, launched a full-scale offensive. They ret took their planet, driven by a newfound determination and aided by Drex's technology.\n\nIn the aftermath, Drex found himself reflecting on his journey. He had come to conquer, but instead he had found redemption. He had allied with humans, a race he once thought inferior, and had helped them reclaim their planet. It was a testament to the power of unity and the possibility of redemption.\n\nAs he watched the humans celebrate their victory, Drex realized that his dream of being part of the Scientific League had changed. He no longer sought glory through conquest and destruction. Instead, he sought a place in the pantheon of those who had helped to rebuild and protect life in the universe.\n\nAnd so, Drex's expedition log came to an end, not with the tale of a conquering race, but with the story of an unlikely alliance that had saved a planet from annihilation. It was a tale of hope, of unity, and of redemption—a tale that would be remembered long after the last human survivor had passed into legend.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the original text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_005", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Saadou, a 37-year-old man hailing from the northeast, traversed his homeland, bound for the forested northern province of a neighboring West African country. His purpose? To sell his herd of 75 cows, accompanied by Tegedantay, a five-year-old girl, and Sulieman, a 10-year-old boy.\n\nThe trio faced the task of crossing a murky river to access the northern province. Their vessel, a sizable raft ferry propelled by an outboard motor, was crafted from securely bound wooden logs, connected with robust nautical ropes.\nOn the opposite bank, awaited two prominent cow traders—Ailemu and Shaiku—anticipating their arrival. Ailemu, with wide eyes and a pot belly, possessed an insatiable drive for profit, willing to engage in business with anyone offering cows for sale, be it 10 or just a lone sickly cow. Ailemu inherited the family cow business, combining his father\"s teachings with a tenacious work ethic. In under two years, despite not knowing how to write his own name, he expanded the enterprise from 15 cows and 27 acres to a staggering 350 cows and over 1000 hectares of land.\nShiaku, a short and stout man with hardly any neck, also inherited the family cow business and rapidly grew it to an admirable 300 cows operation and more than 1000 hectares farm estate, complete with other livestock such as goats and chickens as well as a highly sought after view of the mountains. Having completed secondary schooling, Shaiku focused on securing the most substantial deals or engaging with significant sellers to meet his annual quota of 50 cows. \"Smart work and not hard work,\" a motto he preached to the 30 men under his employment.\nIn the northern province, buying or selling cows inevitably involved dealing with either Ailemu or Shaiku, who dominated the province completely. Thus, a fierce rivalry extended not only between the two traders but also among their respective teams of workers. While public interactions adhered to pleasantries—as custom dictates—between the duo, behind the scenes, workers often endured screechees of \"that fat illiterate rat\" or \"no neck fool\" when a deal slipped through to the opposing party.\n**On the eve** before Saadou, Tegedantay, Sulieman, and their cattle were set to reach the river crossing, Ailemu and Shiaku meticulously briefed their seasoned salesmen, Abu and Ibrahim, on the art of persuasion. The tall and slender herder\"s imminent arrival had been the talk of the town, with scouts and messengers providing detailed insights two weeks prior. Reports raved about the cows\" robust size, their smooth and well-fed appearance, and their ease of rumination when at rest.\nThat evening over dinner with his wife and four children, Ailemu could barely contain his excitement for the potential deal that was about to arrive at his doorstep tomorrow. \"This one is the big one!\" he repeatedly shouted over dinner. The plan was for Abu to handle the negotiations, as he had done countless times before with other herdsmen. However, as the night wore on, Ailemu\"s unease grew. This deal was no ordinary deal like the many others Abu had closed for him; it's a deal that required his special attention and \"hard-work hands\" in order to ensure a favorable outcome. The reports about the 75 cows from his scouts and messengers were more than encouraging—reports he hadn\"t heard describing a cattle herd not since his father\"s time.\nThus, two hours past midnight on the day of the deal, Ailemu, forsaking sleep, rose from his comfortable bed, careful not to disturb his deep-sleeping wife. He promptly dispatched messages to Abu and alerted his house girls to have his favorite gown pressed and ready by Fajr along with a gleaming white babouche, part of his many collections (of various colors) sourced from the finest Moroccan merchants.\n**The morning unfolded** with an unusual dreariness, a mild fog shrouding the surroundings. Shiaku's salesman, Ibrahim, strained his eyes against the river\"s mist, discerning shadowy figures and large four legged beasts on the other side. Having skipped breakfast after the first light of dawn, he had arrived early, eager to meet the man who had been the subject of his boss\"s fascination for weeks. Ibrahim had closed many deals for Shiaku before and was a trusted confidant due to having an eye for the \"smart deals\"\" and quickly fulfilling the 50 cows quota early on in the year, giving his boss time to focus on other matters which range from spending more quality time with his two sons and daughter to tending to livestock on his farm estate.\nOverlooking the shore on a hard muddy hill, Ibrahim placed his hand above his eyes and squinted like an explorer looking for land. \"That's them.\" Coming out of the fog and gliding ever closer to the northern province shore were 25 cows (according to Ibrahim's count) and a gangly boy holding the hand of a short pudgy little girl. Upon seeing the 25 cows, Ibrahim's heart raced and then he remembered that the raft ferry was only so big enough to hold 50 human occupants at a time.\nAfter the two children and 25 cows landed and got off on the shore, the ferryman, without hesitation, turned around his raft ferry and disappeared back into the fog. Couple minutes passed and another 25 cows were seen from the fog before being dropped off on shore with the two children. Another couple minutes later and all the cows were safely on shore. Seeing the cattle for himself, Ibrahim licked his lips as he kept counting and recounting each cow one by one. They were definitely the biggest cows he had seen in all his past dealings. Even better, none of them appeared sick or old for that matter as each was able to sit, stand and move around rather gracefully.\nThe last occupant to emerge from the fog and arrive on shore was Saadou, donning a black gown. Ibrahim got a clear look at the light-skinned and pony-tailed cattle herder everybody was raving about. True, he was tall—just as the scouts and messengers described — but not skinny, at least not by Ibrahim's standards. Eying the cattle herder as he organized his herd, Ibrahim expected the man to be much skinnier, and certainly should not have broad shoulders and muscular arms at that. In fact, the only thing skinny about the man was his long and lanky legs, barely covered by loose black trousers that stopped far short of the ankles.\n\"Where's that big head?\" Ibrahim murmurmered. Noon was approaching and he had not seen any signs of Abu. He loved the feeling of winning deals over Abu. Throughout the years, they engaged in back and forth battles on who could win the most deals over the other: battles when tallied altogether would likely show an even score. Unlike their bosses, they were not shy to hurl insults directly at one another when jostling to entice herders to relinquish their precious commodities at a favorable price. \"Big head asshole!\" \"Black bastard!\" Some of the favorite insults of choice that could be heard all along the river's shore, in addition to hisses and teeth-sucking.\nIbrahim felt a hand on his right shoulder. \"Ah, I thought you were too scared to come, big head. Afraid I am going to whip you again.\"\n\"Never afraid, Ibrahima,\" said the bassy voice.\nIbrahim froze for a moment, feeling the coolness of the sweat running down from his forehead and armpits. He without a doubt recognized the voice but questioned why he was hearing it: at the river of all places.\n\"What?\" the voice said. \"Eh, you not going to look at me?\"\nIbrahim turned around slowly, hoping that if he moved carefully enough, the voice would vanish and he would once again see the familiar forehead he'd been accustomed to seeing at the river all these years. \"Sorry…sa,\" Ibrahim said, sounding defeated as his eyes settled on the fat face and big grin of his boss' longtime rival. There were four houseboys who stood behind him.\n\"Ibrahima, you look not well,\" Ailemu said, wearing a creaseless bright white gown and kufi hat. \"Do you want me to send you to my doctor?\"\n\"No…sa,\" Ibrahim said, caressing his sweaty forehead. \"I thought…Abu—\"\n\"Change of the fate, my son. I will be taking over for Abu.\" Ailemu walked past Ibrahim—followed by his 4 houseboys—and stood at the edge of the hill, rubbing his hands and salivating at all he had been waiting for the past 3 weeks. \"So this is the big one, eh… Mashallah.\"\nIbrahim heard his stomach growling with impatience. It had been growling all morning since arriving at the river but his sales tactic (practiced over and over with Shaiku in the night's prior) to close the deal along with excitement to beat Abu had kept his mind preoccupied. Now, with the thought of having to outmaneuver Ailemu, Ibrahim wished he had listened to his nagging wife and ate something before leaving home. He never competed with Ailemu before on a deal. Matter of fact, he did not remember ever seeing Ailemu at the river; it was always his \"big head\" and short salesman negotiating and closing deals on his behalf. Still, he had heard stories (lots of stories) about the \"big belly man\" and his callous way of doing business from not only his boss but also from other smaller cow traders. \"Getting in the middle of Ailemu and money is like being in middle of a wolf and a sick sheep,\" as bluntly put by a small inland trader who insisted on a private conversation.\n\"Ibrahima, come my son,\" the voice beckoned, its resonance cutting through the air.\nLike a doomed sailor answering the call of a siren, Ibrahim walked with heavy steps towards the voice. When he finally (and reluctantly) made it to the edge of the hill, a blubbery hand wrapped around and covered him like a robe.\n\"Don't worry about Shaiku,\" Ailemu said, pulling Ibrahim closer. He reached inside his big gown, pulled out and plopped a bundle of cash—folded and tied up in a rubber band—on the man's thumping chest. \"Take this and if he throws you out because of today, come to me. You don't need to lie. Tell him it was me, not Abu. You are a good seller, Ibrahima. Allah knows I'm grateful to those who help me.\" Ailemu released Ibrahim, who bent his head down, took his earnings for the day and scurried away.\nWith the competition out of the way, Ailemu shifted his attention to the impending transaction.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The sun had just crested the mountains, casting long shadows over the riverbanks. Saadou, with his coarse ponytail bouncing behind him, surveyed his herd of 75 robust cows, all basking in the golden light. The sight was enough to make any cattle trader's heart leap—and Ailemu's did just that. As he gazed upon the well-fed herd, he knew this was the deal that could tip the scales in the longstanding rivalry with Shaiku.\n\nTegedantay, her eyes wide with curiosity, and Sulieman, proudly holding the rope of the lead cow, stood by Saadou, ready to aid in the negotiation. Ailemu, ever the charismatic businessman, approached the trio with a welcoming smile and a handshake that felt like squeezing a dead fish.\n\n\"I have been waiting for you, Saadou. Your cows are magnificent, and I know we can make a deal that benefits us both,\" Ailemu declared, his eyes glinting with excitement.\n\nSaadou, ever the cautious herder, knew better than to trust appearances. He fixed Ailemu with a steady gaze, saying, \"I've heard of your reputation, Ailemu. I seek only fair play for my herd.\"\n\nAilemu nodded, his smile never faltering. \"Of course, Saadou. Fairness is my priority. But let us first settle on a price. What is your asking price?\"\n\nSaadou hesitated, knowing the value of his herd. \"I would settle for 250,000 naira,\" he said, the words coming out almost as a plea.\n\nAilemu's eyes narrowed. He knew that price was steep, but he also knew that the health and condition of the cows warranted that figure—and more. \"Three hundred thousand naira, and I will include a year's worth of feed for your return journey,\" Ailemu countered, his voice firm but fair.\n\nSaadou's heart raced. He had hoped for a higher number, but he knew the practicality of such an offer. Still, he haggled, \"325,000. And include medical care for the cows during their time with me.\"\n\nAilemu's face remained impassive, but his mind was working furiously. The offer was generous, but the cows were indeed worth the investment. With a heavy sigh, he said, \"Done. And may our business be successful.\"\n\nThe handshake that followed sealed the deal, and Saadou watched as Ailemu's men began organizing the transportation of the cows. Tegedantay clapped her hands in excitement, while Sulieman nodded in approval. They had done well, and Saadou's mind was already wandering to the possibilities of the next herd he could sell.\n\nAs the cows were loaded onto the trucks, Ailemu beckoned Saadou to follow him. They walked to a secluded area, where Ailemu pulled out a thick packet of money, counting out the agreed-upon amount. \"Here is your payment, as promised. And remember, Saadou, this is just the beginning. If you have more cows, I would be interested in buying them, too.\"\n\nSaadou took the money, feeling its heft in his palm. \"Thank you, Ailemu,\" he said sincerely. \"Perhaps next time we can negotiate an even better deal.\"\n\nAilemu laughed, clapping Saadou on the back. \"I look forward to it, my friend.\"\n\nAs Saadou walked away, his thoughts were already turning to the next venture. He knew that with a deal like this, he and his family would be set for a long time to come. But more importantly, he had gained a valuable ally in Ailemu—an ally who could help him navigate the complex world of cattle trading and ensure that his herds would always find a buyer.\n\nBack at the river crossing, Ibrahim watched the scene unfold with a mix of envy and admiration. He had been outmaneuvered by Ailemu but had been treated fairly. It was a reminder that in the business of cattle trading, trust and fair play were as important as the numbers. As he walked away, he made a mental note to improve his own business practices and perhaps, one day, become a powerhouse in the trade just like Ailemu and Shaiku.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_006", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The pungent odor of the sea hit Julwei first as she snapped awake. The familiar mix of old fish and gull burned her nostrils. The throbbing pain in her skull came next. Her back and shoulders burned with pain but, judging from the chill that worked down her back, nothing important was broken.\n\n\nJulwei pushed herself to her feet. Wood and cloth and silver spicefish littered the dented cooling plate around her. The familiar buzz of a nearby arc core — the power source for the plate, of course — ran along her arms. She spared a glance to the man whose stall she ruined.\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\nThe islander crossed his arms and narrowed his grey eyes in response.\n\n\"Fair enough.\" Julwei shrugged. \"You see a lizard? Green scales, tall, strong.\"\n\nHe pointed through a hole in the yellow canopy, a hole, she was sure, recently added when Julwei fell from the cliff above. She scanned the cliff. No sign of the lizardfolk who threw her down.\n\n\"You sure he didn't follow me down?\"\n\nThe man offered no response.\n\n\"You know where he went?\"\n\nStill nothing.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nPulling her black hair out of her face, Julwei nodded a farewell. She thought, for a moment, that the vendor may try to stop her. She had destroyed his shop, technically. He would be justified. But he only grumbled at her as she passed. Perhaps he saw some kinship in her brown eyes. He recognized her as one of his own. If not from this town — this island — another nearby.\n\nOr perhaps he feared the gun hanging from her hip.\n\nRaising a hand to block the sun, she scanned the town. Osprey was a small port, compared to those that dotted the coast of the kingdom, but not empty. It sat several days off the fastest trade routes, protected from intruders by storms, coral reefs, and sandbanks. Only small ships could safely navigate to the harbor, and most preferred to row in. Yet enough managed to make the journey to turn the island into one of the few trading hubs outside kingdom control. Unofficially, the kingdom deemed Osprey a lost cause and left it to pirates, rebels, and other lowlifes.\n\nOfficially, it didn't exist.\n\nThe cliffs shielded half of Osprey from the vengeful sun and colorful tarps made of flora cloth protected the rest. They were strung together between leaning multi-storey wooden structures and poles painted in pastels. The port was mostly cobbled together from the wood of half sunk ships. Only a faint suggestion of the island's original architecture remained.\n\nJulwei watched the crowd as she made her way to the coast. Islanders, kingdom escapees, and even the occasional mekanica filled the port, but her bounty was nowhere in sight. Under different circumstances, she would be impressed how a creature with scales and a tail could disappear in a place smaller than a kingdom galleon. Even in the islands, lizardfolk were uncommon. The few she did see didn't match his height or coloring.\n\nHer body ached with every step, a constant painful reminder of who she was hunting. Nothing compared to the pulsing in her head. At the moment, Julwei wanted nothing more than a warm bath and healing salve, but she couldn't wait. She spent a month tracking the lizardfolk to Osprey. Allowing him to escape wasn't an option.\n\nIf she was lucky, he slipped back into the jungle and fell prey to the island. If she was unlucky, he retreated and set another trap.\n\nEither way, she still needed proof.\n\nThe beach had no shade and the sun burned Julwei's skin as she stepped into the sea. Everything on the islands was warmer. Even the water felt pleasant against her skin, except for the salt in her wounds, unlike the cold waves in the mainland. Were it not for the bounty or her debts, she might not return to the kingdom.\n\nEven with the debts, she was tempted to stay.\n\nJulwei knelt in the water for a moment, collecting herself. The waves pushed against her with an easy, lazy rhythm. The backwash carved grooves under her knees and boots. Salt stung the cuts she didn't even know she had. A curious scuttler inched dangerously close, snapping its pincers as a threat, but even the mere act of flicking it away seemed like too much work. Her next encounter with the lizardfolk would require a more careful approach. He was too strong to risk a direct fight, especially without taking time to recover and treat her injuries. Time she couldn't afford.\n\nClosing her eyes, Julwei focused her mind on the bounty, calling forth an image of the lizardfolk. It was easier now that she had seen his face in person. The drawing from the bounty office didn't show his scales were green or the way the split in his lip widened when he snarled. His teeth weren't as sharp or long and a few were missing, no doubt knocked loose in a bar fight after he defected. Lizardfolk wore age differently than humans, but he looked older. Not significantly, but whoever described him remembered someone young.\n\nThe drawings showed his eyes dark and full of malice. The artist depicted him as the villain the kingdom proclaimed.\n\nHis eyes were yellow and afraid.\n\nJulwei pictured the lizard as he was before he threw her from the cliff. Afraid but violent. Easily tossing her with one arm, the other tight on his satchel, roaring in fury. She pictured every scar, every tooth, each of the tiny spurs on his jaw and scalp, and held that image in her mind as she submerged herself.\n\nThen she took a breath.\n\nHer lungs screamed as she swallowed the salty water. Her body forgot the pain in her head and on her limbs. All she could feel was fire in her chest. Every sane part of her body urged her to surface, but Julwei focused her thoughts only on the lizardfolk. She pushed herself deeper into the sea, even as the darkness creeped into the corners of her mind, teasing her with death.\n\nSome called it magic. Others sorcery, the ether, witchcraft, the cold, and many other words for the space between life and death. Few could reach it and many that could passed too far into death. The ether was power. Uncontrollable without luck or training, but power on the same. By the laws of the kingdom, witchcraft was outlawed. The problem often took care of itself but, when deemed necessary, the kingdom punished witches with ruthless efficiency.\n\nThere were exceptions. Hushed whispers spread in dark corners of the kingdom. Rumors of strange powers used by the kingdom's own enforcers — inquisitors, a dying breed of an ancient order. Rumors spread too of wealthy officials and particularly lucky gamblers, but neither seemed worthy of an inquisitor's time. The kingdom overlooked Julwei for reasons she didn't understand and didn't question. She felt the familiar chill from enough of her contracts to know the kingdom's blind eye was a privilege, not a right.\n\nThey would come for her someday. She only hoped to die before then.\n\nAs the last of her strength waned away, the world came into a new focus. Shadows shifted into smoky images painted in muted colors that turned to junglewood and stone. The smell of earth and ash filled her nose. The sounds of birds and panthers and other beasts echoed around her. Her vision sharpened and her eyes focused on a broken pyramid deep within the island.\n\nHer bounty hadn't fled.\n\nJulwei broke the surface, gasping for fair, and flailed wildly until the water was shallow enough for to pull herself away. Every breath stung. Between each, she purged the water from her lungs. But she could breathe. She was alive. Most importantly, the shortcut worked. She found her bounty.\n\nBy the time the sun dipped beyond the horizon — its last golden rays painting the sky in shades of orange — Julwei was deep in the jungle. Her head and lungs hadn't forgiven her yet, but impatience won out. She limped along the narrow trail, following the path now seared in her memory. The ether gave her a vague idea of her destination through her bounty's eyes, but the hike wasn't easy and the little aches began to weigh on her. She ignored the concerning noises coming from the canopy, always a creature just out of sight, though she kept her hand on her pistol as a precaution. She couldn't stop until she found shelter.\n\nFortunately, that had been done for her.\n\nThe lizardfolk had found a temple hidden within the island and established a camp. She had a hazy image of the ancient stone and overgrown roots in her mind, but she recognized the patterns carved on the walls. Or her bounty did, at least. She had never seen one before, though stories of similar temples spread throughout the kingdom. Some claimed that a great civilization once conquered the world, stretching beyond even the kingdom's current borders. None could explain how such a great nation could collapse and leave behind nothing but old stone.\n\nAs far as Julwei was concerned, the stepped pyramids of the islands had nothing to do with the ruins in the kingdom or the one found in the colonies. Supposed connections were nothing but delusions by novelists.\n\nYet she felt her pain give way to excitement. She heard stories of great explorers as a child, of dashing adventurers who retrieved relics from the clutches of vile monsters. They ventured deep into the ruins for mysterious artifacts steeped in power. Others told stories of the spirits that still haunted the temples, guarding their homes from intruders, luring them into traps or remnants of magic.\n\nFoolish treasure hunters claimed they stole artifacts from under the nose of kingdom forces. They could rarely make such claims twice.\n\nThe kingdom encouraged rumors. They greatly appreciated the relics and exploration done by treasure hunters, officially sanctioned or not. The reward for a genuine piece of history exceeded any bounty tenfold. To keep things civil, the punishment for any forgery was severe, often death. The king's archivists were not easily fooled.\n\nNot that Julwei needed to worry. Osprey's temple obviously remained undiscovered thus far, otherwise the kingdom's fleet would have already claimed it. No island beast or coral reef was so dangerous a thousand soldiers couldn't best it.\n\nThey might even reward her for its discovery.\n\nThe only obstacle was one lizard. The bounty would be hers. The relics would be hers to sell. And Julwei could find a warm beach to stay.\n\nAssuming he didn't kill her.\n\nDusk turned to night by the time Julwei found the temple. The pyramid peaked above the canopy, a beacon between the twin Dar moons. She felt the air shift as she drew closer. A chill crept under her skin and pulled her closer to the ether. Briefly, Julwei debated her stance on temple ghosts. She found it easier to dismiss them as stories before she felt the cold.\n\nJulwei knew there had been a time when the temple sat over nature, a triumph of its creators, but it was hard to see anything other than a ruin. Much of the original structure lost its centuries-long battle with the surrounding jungle. Only the skeleton remained. Moss and vines covered the structure's stony base. A large tree rose from what had once been a courtyard, surrounded now by rubble. Its large thick roots twisted through the gaps in the stone floor. One entrance collapsed into a pile of rock and wood. Another was blocked by overgrown vines and roots.\n\nThe jungle claimed this land. As it always would.\n\nChecking for traps, Julwei circled the temple. She lacked the enhanced eyesight of her prey, but years of close calls taught her what to look for: a glint of light, a clearing too clean, or a silhouette out of place. She found none of these. She did, however, find her bounty's camp in the courtyard. Chests served as tables for tools, books, and buckets of colorful liquid. He built a lean-to against a decayed all, the roof made of the same floracloth of Osprey's town. A fire pit, dug into the temple itself, was full of ash, but nor embers. For a moment, Julwei thought her witchcraft might have failed her again — there was no sign the bounty here — but she felt the ether pull her inside.\n\nJulwei pulled her pistol from its holster and approached the only unbarred entrance to the temple's interior. She stepped lightly on the stone. Her heart thundered in her chest as the memory of her last encounter with the lizardfolk forced its way to the front of her mind. She would be lucky to survive another fight.\n\nShe considered if her target would still be alive. The jungle hadn't killed either of them yet, but the temple might. She could wait the night outside and leave her bounty to the ghosts. If there was still a body, she would claim it in the morning, under the safety of the sun.\n\nShe waited for another breath, but no ghost showed itself.\n\nThe hairs on her arm stood as she crept down the passage. Moss clung to her as she brushed past and, no matter how hard she tried to brush it away, it stuck. The cold turned her veins to ice. The rhythmic tap of metal on stone echoed through the hall, growing louder as she drew closer.\n\nEventually, the narrow hallway opened to a larger rectangle room. More darkened paths led to dead ends on three of the chamber's four sides, blocked at their ends by nature's power. Two mighty stone pillars supported what remained of the roof. Vines dangled from a hole.\n\nJungle growth covered half of the fourth wall. On the other half was a mural of a man under the waning moon, behind him a pyramid much like the temple she stood in. While the man was only carved into the wall, the pyramid was lined with white and gold. Dar Eon was painted in her lunar blues, her shadows stretching beyond the confines of the wall. On the other side, Julwei could see the beginnings of a mirrored scene, no doubt with the rising twin. Between the murals, a large stone door sat a few steps above the floor.\n\nHer bounty focused on the wall, oblivious to her as she approached. Tapping at the wall with a hammer and chisel, he carved along the ancient grooves, clearing them of moss and age. Scars crossed in patterns on his shoulders and back. His muscles rippled beneath his rough skin as he worked. The bony spurs that lined his jaw and scalp continued down his spine and tail. They were short and sparse, but sharp enough to do some damage in a fight.\n\nHe wore a belt with several knives and an empty holster. His gun, a strange piece with a wide barrel and a leather-wrapped grip, sat on the crate by the base of the steps, surrounded by brushes, chisels, and his discarded shirt. An old lantern lit the room.\n\nThe strange orb next to it caught Julwei's attention.\n\nMarkings similar to the ones engraved around the temple were etched into the metal bands that lazily rotated around the center. The sphere within sat still. Were it not for her connection to the ether, she might have considered it no more than a gyroscope, but she felt the cold around it, denser than the rest of the temple. It was the exact kind of relic chronicler's sought.\n\nIf the lizardfolk knew, he could have traded it for the bounty on his life.\n\nJulwei thumbed the hammer back on her pistol until she heard the click. Her bounty stopped his chiseling. His shoulders tensed. Turning around slowly, he faced Julwei with a sad smile. A pendant hung around his neck. It was inscribed with lettering in a language Julwei could not read, but she knew from others that it was his name, written in a sacred script of a long dead religion.\n\n\"Bounty Hunter,\" the lizard greeted. His voice was soft and scholarly. \"So that was you I smelled.\"\n\nHis eyes darted to his gun. Julwei could see the indecision on his face. Was he fast enough to reach it before she took her shot? If he were to die anyway, could he take her with him? Was there a point to trying?\n\nThe situation was not unfamiliar to her.\n\n\"You do not scare as easy as the others,\" he mused. The tension in his shoulders disappeared. Clearly, he accepted his fate. \"I should have known. I've seen your eyes on others. Brave, all of them. Stupid some. Is there any chance you let me live?\"\n\n\"Afraid not.\"\n\n\"I assumed as much. Do you have a name, Bounty Hunter?\"\n\n\"Julwei.\"\n\n\"I am Seros. I imagine you know this already.\"\n\nJulwei nodded.\n\n\"Did they tell you what I did?\"\n\n\"Didn't ask.\"\n\n\"No. You wouldn't.\" Seros shook his head. \"I can tell you I am innocent.\"\n\n\"I don't care.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't,\" Seros repeated. His gaze turned downward. The lizardfolk was a mass of muscles and scars that towered over her, yet in this moment, he looked fragile. His body was as much a ruin as the temple. As if he could collapse at any moment.\n\nJulwei's grip on her gun loosened.\n\n\"I was a bounty hunter too, once. I served the kingdom, killing who they asked for fifty years. I fought their war — before your time. It is a hard life. I know you know this. We do not have many friends.\" Seros sighed. \"I thought I had one.\"\n\n\"You were betrayed.\"\n\nHe nodded. His movements were slow and methodical. \"I was. I heard secrets not meant for my ears. I made no trouble, but my knowing was enough. My confidant chose the kingdom over me. Decades of service and execution was my reward..\"\n\nSeros took a heavy breath. He trembled as he spoke, obviously pained by the memories, but Julwei understood the way he studied her. The sadness in his eyes was genuine, but he was clever enough to weaponize that, hoping that she would drop her guard and let him close the distance. Had she not already lost one fight, his plan might have succeeded.\n\nJulwei steadied her aim.\n\n\"Before you kill me, nessa, would you like to know the secret?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nJulwei pulled the trigger.\n\nA heartbeat later, Seros still stood. No blood painted the walls. No thunder rang out. Only the thud of the hammer slamming forward and wet gunpowder failing to ignite.\n\nSeros reacted quicker than Julwei. Shifting his weight, he turned on his heel and slammed his thick tail into Julwei's abdomen before leaping for his gun. Her stomach lurched. The pain from the hit quickly faded as she slammed into one of the pillars, smacking her head against the stone. Stars swarmed her vision. The world around her dulled and blurred, but she didn't faint this time. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.\n\nShe had no time to recover. Julwei heard a click and threw herself to the ground. Above her, the stone shattered into dust. Seros\" pistol left a small grouping of holes in the pillar. He cracked the gun open toward the rear of the barrel, ejecting a smoking shell.\n\nJulwei pushed herself to her feet. Her own pistol disappeared into one of the dark corners of the room. Even if she had it in hand, she couldn't clear her pistol and reload before him. She'd be lucky if the rest of her stores of gunpowder were dry.\n\nSeros pulled another cartridge from the pouch on his belt. He took slow confident steps toward Julwei, a stern look on his face, though the corners of his mouth turned up in a slight smile. Relief tempered by the somber role of executioner. The sadness in his eyes never faded. He snapped the weapon closed, thumbing back the hammer, and aimed for her chest.\n\n\"I am sorry it has come to this.\"\n\nIf he were heartless, a shot would have rang through the temple and Julwei would be dead. Instead, the lizardfolk hesitated.\n\nJulwei darted forward and shoved her shoulder into him with all her strength. His eyes widened in surprise at her bravery, though Julwei did little more than knock Seros off balance. Still, she bought time.\n\nJulwei pulled one of the lizardfolk's knives from his belt, slicing across his stomach and chest in one smooth motion. He hissed. Blue blood spilled from the wound, but the cut wasn't deep enough for any lasting damage. Pressing her limited advantage, Julwei stabbed the knife through his wrist. Seros howled in pain, dropping the gun, and pulled away from her. Eyes locked on his movement, Julwei kicked the gun away and raised her fists.\n\n\"Sanessa,\" Seros growled.\n\nJulwei punched him. Her fist connected ineffectively with his stomach. Her knuckles scraped on his scales. Seros returned the blow with a clumsy swing of his good arm, knocking Julwei onto her back. The air escaped her lungs as she hit the ground. Her already bruised muscles screamed in protest. Rolling away, Julwei narrowly dodged his kick, and she found her footing before he could do more.\n\nSeros lumbered toward her. His smile faded and eyes hardened. Relief and regret both twisted into anger. The floor shuddered with every step. Julwei glanced around for a weapon, wishing now she had stolen his gun or a second knife. With only her fists, she was more likely to break her own hand than hurt him. Her options were limited.\n\nShe knew how this would end.\n\nSeros grabbed Julwei, lifting her by her shirt with one arm. He ignored her futile struggles as he pinned her against the pillar. Something cracked, stone or bone, Julwei wasn't sure. She brought her shin to his groin with enough force to topple any man, but the lizard only grunted. He pressed his arm against her throat. The knife remained embedded in his wrist. Julwei flinched as the icy blood dripped onto her shoulder. Leaning in close, Seros hissed at her, showing too many sharp teeth.\n\n\"I asked for mercy, Bounty Hunter. This could have ended differently.\"\n\nJulwei pushed against the pressure on her throat with one hand, trying to grab another knife from the lizardfolk's belt with the other. Failing that, she searched her pockets in a desperate attempt to find anything of value. Her hand closed on a collection of damp paper wads.\n\nShe shoved the fistful into Seros' face, cutting a packet open on one of the bony spurs on his cheek, and rubbed the damp gunpowder into his eyes. He growled and released his grip just enough for her to bring air back into her lungs. Yanking the knife from his wrist, she plunged it into his side, unleashing a flood of cold blood and a howl of pain.\n\nJulwei pushed away from, wincing as she hit the stone again. Blindly lashing out, Seros kicked at her, following the attack with a swipe from his tail. The floor shattered beneath his steps as Julwei dodged the strikes. Shards of rock bit her arms and chest. Scrambling away, Julwei put as much distance between them as she could.\n\nThe bounty, she decided, was underpriced.\n\nHer hand closed around the wooden grip of a gun. Not hers. Too heavy and wide. Julwei spun and pulled the trigger. She didn't have time to aim. A deafening sound burst from the gun and her arm nearly sprung from its socket. Only practice and fear let her keep her grip on the weapon. The recoil left her exposed, open to retaliation. She had to hope she didn't miss.\n\nShe didn't.\n\nThe shot went low and a little wide, hitting Seros in the gut on the opposite side of the knife. Blood poured from the wound. The pellets embedded in his stomach and a wide hole went through what used to be a vital organ. Some shrapnel hit his damaged arm. His hand was limp as he pressed it to his side.\n\nSeros stumbled back until he was leaning on the wall then sunk to the floor, leaving behind a bloody streak on the moss. His yellow eyes were wide with shock. Julwei had seen the scared look many times before, though it never grew easier to bear.\n\nIn their final moments, all feared death.\n\nJulwei approached with caution, pausing only to retrieve Seros' belt from the floor. Her shot ruined the leather and buckle, so she slung it over her shoulder. Seros drooped his head, giving up the fight. For a moment, there was silence. Each challenging the other to speak.\n\nSeros gave in sooner.\n\n\"They will come for you too,\" he said. His voice was weak and made small by the vastness of the room. The lizardfolk coughed blood, sprinkling droplets on the floor between them. His dull green scales had all but disappeared beneath the blue stains.\n\n\"Likely.\"\n\nJulwei ejected the spent cartridge from the gun. Seros' weapon was unlike any she used before, but it felt natural in her hand. Locking in another round, she raised the gun at him, careful to stay out of reach of his tail.\n\nSeros locked his eyes to hers. \"This is a mistake, nessa.\"\n\n\"Not the first time I've heard that.\" Julwei pulled back the hammer. \"Won't be the last. Anything else?\"\n\nSeros glared at her. He moved his fingers to the knife, wincing as he touched the hilt. A gurgling sound followed as he freed it from his side. Julwei tensed. Even with an open wound, even with a mangled arm, he worried her. She knew he couldn't hit her before she fired; his wounds were too severe. Still, she took a step back.\n\n\"Jenai.\" He brought the knife to his neck and cut his necklace free. He held it tight in his good hand. \"That is my secret. Jenai is our hope.\"\n\nFinally, after a lengthy sigh, he nodded to her.\n\nThe weapon barked. The wall behind Seros erupted into splinters and what was left of the lizardfolk's broken body slumped over, blood and gore spilling onto the floor. Julwei flinched at the surge of cold that followed as his spirit crossed the ether.\n\nSeros was dead.\n\nThe bounty was complete.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Breathing a slow, heavy sigh, Julwei allowed the gun's hammer to fall limp in her hand. She had done her job, but the weight of her actions pressed down on her. The loss of life always affected her, no matter how justified. She could never forget that she was not just taking care of a job, she was taking a life.\n\nTaking a deep breath, she took a moment to acknowledge the silence in the temple. She had been alone in her thoughts, but now another presence filled the space.\n\nThe orb on the pedestal.\n\nIt began to glow with a soft, pulsing light. The metal bands around its center spun faster and faster. The glow grew brighter, illuminating the room and sending the shadows dancing on the walls. Julwei's heart raced. She was familiar with the stories of these ancient relics; few people knew how they worked, or how to unlock their magic. Most who tried ended up dead or lost to madness. She had seen this sort of power before, but never to such an extent. She knew she should be wary, but her curiosity drew her in. She needed to understand what she had just witnessed.\n\nThe spinning slowed and then stopped. The glow faded, but the orb remained lit with a faint golden hue. Words appeared on its surface, glowing just as brightly. Julwei squinted, trying to make them out:\n\n\"Find the key that opens the door of the temple. Only the brave may claim the prize within.\"\n\nJulwei turned to the doorway to the inner chamber, the one lined with gold and white paint that featured the twin Moons of Dar. She had seen the mural depicting a man standing before the door, and now she understood. This was the key.\n\nShe glanced at the blood and the shattered remains of Seros. He had done the same, obviously trying to unlock the door. He must have been close to success.\n\n\"Jenai is our hope,\" she murmured, repeating the last words Seros had spoken. There was something about those words that rang true, that stirred something in her soul. Julwei realized that she had to see the secrets behind the door. She had to know what Seros was talking about.\n\nThe door itself was heavy and sturdy, made of solid stone. Yet, as Julwei approached, she felt a strange energy emanating from it. Her hands found the indentations that matched the mural's depiction of the man's hands. Julwei placed her hands into the grooves and pushed. The door began to open with a creak that echoed through the temple, sending waves of dust and debris cascading down from the top. \n\nThe door swung wide, revealing a cavernous chamber filled with an assortment of artifacts and treasures. Julwei's eyes widened in awe. The contents of this room were beyond her wildest dreams. Shimmering jewels, ancient weapons, and strange devices lined the walls. A large, ornate chest sat in the center of the room. Its lid was ajar, hinting at the wonders contained within.\n\nYet, as Julwei's gaze fell upon the chest, it was the relic that drew her attention. It stood in a small alcove, surrounded by a soft glow. The relic was a small, intricately carved stone tablet. On its surface were symbols that Julwei did not recognize. But then, she had never seen the sacred script of the long-dead religion before.\n\nThe tablet was the key. The only question was how to use it.\n\nJulwei approached the relic, her heart pounding with anticipation. She reached out a hand, but before she could touch it, the glow around the tablet intensified. Words appeared on its surface, glowing brightly:\n\n\"Brave one, seek the truth. The knowledge of the ancients lies within.\"\n\nThe words seemed to be addressed to her. Julwei knew that she had to take the tablet. It was her destiny. She reached out and closed her hand around it. A surge of energy flowed through her, and for a moment, she felt like she was connected to the universe itself.\n\nThe tablet began to glow even more brightly, and then Julwei's vision went black. The energy from the tablet coursed through her, bringing with it images and memories that were not her own. She saw ancient battles, the construction of the temples, and the fall of a great civilization. She felt the pride and sorrow, the joy and despair of the people who had once lived here.\n\nShe saw the lizardfolk, Seros, who had once been a human. He had been betrayed by the kingdom, and in his desperation, he had found the lost temple and its teachings. He had become a lizardfolk, not by choice, but by curse. The artifact in the temple had the power to transform, but it was forbidden. Seros had been seeking the knowledge of the ancients to break the curse and restore his humanity.\n\nJulwei's vision cleared, and she found herself back in the temple. The tablet was still in her hand, but it no longer glowed. She was filled with a new sense of purpose. She had to protect this temple and its secrets. She had to ensure that the knowledge of the ancients was not lost again.\n\nShe also knew that she needed to get out of the temple. The elements were beginning to take their toll on the structure, and she did not want to be here when it collapsed.\n\nAs she made her way back through the temple, she thought about Seros and the kingdom that had betrayed him. She had once served the kingdom herself, and she had seen the evil that lurked in its heart. She had come to realize that the kingdom was not always right, and that sometimes, its laws were unjust.\n\nJulwei emerged from the temple and into the jungle. She knew that her life would never be the same again. She would never be able to go back to the kingdom, not until she had done what she had to do.\n\nFor now, she had to find a way to break the curse that Seros had been seeking. She had to find a way to protect the temple and its secrets. She would do whatever it took, even if it meant going against the kingdom.\n\nThe future was uncertain, but Julwei was ready to face it head-on.

{"id": "text_completion_007", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: All was quiet in Ura city hall. Not even a mouse dared to stir because of the cat Goldtail. He was satisfied with his work and bathed in the sun coming through a window. Much like the relaxed feline, Evelyn was taking a nap on her desk. A bit of drool came out of her mouth and damaged a document about precautions to take in a tornado. When would those be necessary? Becca sat by the front of building in case anyone needed help from the city. It was an uncommon occurrence as most people in Ura could handle themself and realized the mayor was an idiot, but they liked the sheriff and her deputy.\n\n\nDerrick, the deputy in question, was deep in the library reading one of the few remaining fiction books again. This was a book published in 1924, and it told the tale of a lone cowboy fighting a group of pirates. It made little sense, and the prose was awful. The book was still moderately enjoyable and passed the time well. Nearby, Larry was reading rules and regulations determined how to escape captivity as the town mime.\n\nThe silence was held in tact as a group of three people snuck into the library. They crouched behind the bookshelves and moved through the stacks. One person slipped on a book and fell flat on their face unleashing a thud. Derrick ignored the noise while Larry went to check it out. When Larry saw the people, he opened his mouth to scream, but a sound didn't escape his mouth. He was committed to the role. He ran out of the library to get help.\n\nDerrick stayed in his spot reading his book. He had reached the chapter where the cowboy was about to spring a trap on the pirates with gold from the mines. A knife was on his neck before he could finish which was a rude way to interrupt someone.\n\n\"Come with us.\" The knife-wielder had a nasally voice. Derrick sighed and placed the book to the side. He placed his arms behind his back.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the knife-wielder asked.\n\n\"Aren't you going to restrain me?\"\n\n\"Uh, we don't have ropes.\" The knife-wielder looked to his group who shrugged. \"We should've brought that. Why don't you two just grab one hand each and walk out with him.\" The two kidnappers did as they were told. Derrick found this arrangement more comfortable.\n\n\"Could you pick up my book? I was getting to the good part,\" Derrick asked.\n\n\"Sure.\" The knife-wielder bent over and picked up. Derrick was escorted by the kidnappers who held his hand while they walked.\n\nEvelyn's office was the closest to the library. Larry ran in there and began to point outside. He gesticulated wildly with his arm indicating knife and then held his hands behind his back. Evelyn remained asleep. Larry waved his hands before her to wake her up, but she stayed rested. Larry rolled his eyes and moved on to his next target. While the front hall was empty, Becca stayed alert. She kept one eye at the door and another at the crossword puzzle she found. This crossword was from twenty years before the war which made it more challenging, but she would solve it. Her intellectual pursuit was interrupted by a glove hand. Becca looked up to see Larry's face.\n\n\"Could you go ask Derrick? I'm busy here,\" she said. Larry slapped his hand with his face. He considered breaking his vow and saying what happened, but that would break regulation. Such a transgression was unforgivable. He waved his hand before her again.\n\n\"In a minute,\" she said. Larry slammed his fist on the table before her. Becca looked up.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked. Larry began to mime reading a book and sighing. He looked up from the book with a sour face. \"Derrick.\" Becca said. Larry held a finger up to his neck; then, he put his hands behind his back. Becca tilted her head in confusion. Larry scratched his chin for a moment. He grabbed Becca's handcuffs and put them on his own hands. \"Oh my god, he's been kidnapped.\" Becca ran to Evelyn leaving Larry with the handcuffs on.\n\nWhen Becca found Evelyn asleep, she first tried to push Evelyn awake gently. When it became clear that wasn't going to work, Becca removed the paper from underneath her and rolled it up. After hesitating over whether it was the right thing to do, Becca whacked Evelyn with the paper. Evelyn shot up.\n\n\"It was Becca's fault,\" she shouted.\n\n\"I'm right here,\" Becca said.\n\n\"Exactly whatever it was you did it.\"\n\n\"I didn't kidnap Derrick,\" Becca said. Evelyn leaned back and scanned Becca.\n\n\"Becca, you don't treat your employees that way,\" Evelyn replied. Becca shook her head.\n\n\"No, Derrick has been kidnapped, and I need your help to find him,\" Becca said. Larry ran into the room waving his arms trying to get her to remove the handcuffs. \"Not now.\"\n\n\"Why do you need me? You're the sheriff.\"\n\n\"I need backup. Also, if you help me, I'll make your lunch for a week.\"\n\n\"You already make my lunch.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure to include cornbread in your lunch going forward.\"\n\n\"Deal.\" Evelyn walked outside her office. \"Come on. I know he always lounges in the library so there must be clues there.\"\n\nThe noise woke Goldtail up. He looked up at Larry struggling to get the handcuffs off and was amused. Goldtail could use his inherent feline escape abilities to assist the mime, but this was more entertaining. Besides, clouds were gathering outside ruining his sun; he needed something to keep him entertained.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The group moved towards the library, where everyone's eyes immediately homed in on the scene. Books were haphazardly strewn about, and a chair sat askew. Becca's instincts kicked in, and she started examining the scene more closely, looking for any signs of the intruders. Goldtail, with keen feline curiosity, began to follow the scent of the strangers.\n\n\"We need to find the trail they left,\" Becca instructed, her voice echoing in the now deserted hall. Larry, still handcuffed, could only nod in response, his mime routine interrupted by the urgency of the situation. \n\nEvelyn, meanwhile, was already on her phone, trying to rally additional forces and inform the citizens of the kidnapping. No one wanted the town's peace disturbed, and everyone was willing to do their part to ensure that peace was maintained.\n\nAmidst their search, Evelyn's voice suddenly broke through the silence. \"I've alerted Mayor Jasper; he's sending the town's militia to help. But until then, it's up to us.\" She looked determined, a rare expression for the usually lethargic mayor’s deputy.\n\nMeanwhile, Derrick, calm and collected, continued reading his book as the kidnappers led him out of the city hall and into the deserted streets of Ura. The knife-wielder, though annoyed, continued to hold the book for him, finding Derrick's calmness strangely contagious.\n\nThe group then received a call from an old, cranky resident, Mrs. Hitchcock, who claimed to have seen something. \"I saw some suspicious characters lurking around the old factory on the edge of town. They were in a hurry, and they had something with them – it looked like they were carrying a sack.\"\n\nFollowing Mrs. Hitchcock's lead, the group moved towards the factory, guided by Goldtail, whose keen senses were leading them to Derrick's location. The sun had already set, casting long shadows that crept along the decrepit factory walls, giving an air of foreboding to the whole scene.\n\nArriving at the factory, they found the back door slightly ajar. Stealthy and quiet, they entered the building. It was a shadowy labyrinth inside, filled with rusted machinery and cobwebs. Becca signaled Evelyn to take the left, Larry to take the right, while she and Goldtail would go straight ahead. \n\nTheir search took them through a maze of old equipment and broken crates. Goldtail suddenly stopped, ears perked high, eyes narrowing. He darted behind a large, rusted machine. Becca followed, her heart pounding in her chest. There, in the corner, hidden from plain sight, was Derrick, tied up, but still reading his book.\n\nWith a silent nod to Evelyn and Larry, Becca approached Derrick. She crouched beside him, her eyes meeting his. \"Are you alright?\" she asked, concern etched in her face.\n\n\"Just dandy,\" Derrick replied with a crooked smile. \"I finished the book.\"\n\nBecca chuckled, relief flooding through her. \"That's good to hear. But we need to get you untied and back to safety.\"\n\nAs she worked on the knots binding Derrick, Evelyn and Larry appeared with the kidnappers in tow. The intruders, caught off guard, looked ready to run, but the determined expressions on the faces of Ura's protectors stopped them in their tracks.\n\n\"Don't even think about it,\" Evelyn warned, her voice firm.\n\nThe kidnappers, realizing their fate was sealed, dropped to their knees, surrendering quietly. It was a peaceful resolution to the day's events, with no violence and no loss of life – much to Becca's relief.\n\nAs they walked out of the factory, the first stars appeared in the night sky. Ura was quiet again, but the people had bonded over their shared goal, creating a stronger community in the process. Derrick, now freed, had a newfound appreciation for his colleagues, while Larry finally got the chance to break his vow of silence. \n\nAnd Goldtail? He lounged in the moonlight, content with his role in the adventure, ready to take on whatever came next.\n\nBack at the city hall, Evelyn was already drawing up the report, detailing the day's events. Becca could see her deputy's handwriting improve with each entry. Meanwhile, a tired but satisfied Becca sat at her desk, reviewing the crossword puzzle she had been working on earlier. She finally solved it, the last answer fitting perfectly into place. \n\n\"Peace,\" she read aloud, smiling at the irony.\n\nAnd so, under the watchful eyes of the moon and the ever-vigilant Goldtail, Ura found its peace once more.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the original text by keeping the characters' behaviors and tones consistent.

Were it not for the fact that the coffee cup had been sitting undisturbed for 45 minutes, it would have certainly burned her hands when the liquid splashed over, but as so many things have before, it had gotten away from her.

Allison was her assistant, and she already knows what she was going to hear, but sometimes, you have to let people answer questions you know the answer to, so they feel the gravity on their own lips. There is a pause on the other end, the distinct silence of apprehension, before Allisons timid voice breaks through. \"Hi ma'am, sorry to bother you on your day off, but…\" she trails off, unsure of how to word the coming letdown in a way that would not be her own undoing. Her boss was an intense woman, and this intensity was about to bubble over. \"Out with it Allison, I haven't got all day to wait for you to collect your thoughts,\" and as if her words weren't sharp enough, she adds \"if you have any, that is.\" Allison's voice catches in her throat, and she changes course, no longer caring to present her bad news with any tact. \"The deal with Maybelline has fallen through, they've decided to go with another firm.\" There it is, the terrible truth, and even though she knew what Allison was going to say, the sting is just as great. The fire that was already brewing within her grows ever more. She is having an awful morning, and now the biggest deal of the year has eluded her grasp; so much for Saturday. Reeling from anger and disappointment, she doesn't pay any mind to Allisons frantic mumbling, as she clutches the phone with an iron grip. She takes a deep breath, and interrupts the panicking assistant. \"Allison, stop talking,\" She says rather coldly, \"I will be in the office in 20 minutes, gather the partners, and for godsakes, have a pot of coffee ready.\" She hangs up before Allison has a chance to say anything further. For a moment all is quiet, as she collects her thoughts. She is used to being on call seven days a week; there is always a fire that needs to be put out, but she needed today. The idea of facing the world this morning feels terribly heavy.\n\nAs she surveys the sleek, minimalist design of her penthouse apartment, a surge of revulsion washes over her. The sterile aesthetic, once a symbol of sophistication, now feels suffocating. With each pristine surface and carefully curated piece of furniture, her anger simmers beneath the surface, threatening to boil over. Before she even knows what she\"s done, the coffee cup smashes into a framed picture on the far wall, sending both crashing to the ground in a spray of broken glass and ceramic shards. She lets out a guttural scream, containing the fullness of her anger, and perhaps a bit of sadness. As it leaves her body, and reason seeps back into her mind, she sees what she has done and is overcome with another familiar feeling; grief. \"No, no, no…\" she desperately whispers to herself as she rushes to the wreckage on the far side of the room, and begins digging through the pile of glass with reckless abandon, cutting her hands in the process, but paying it no mind. How could she be so foolish, so stupid? In the shattered remains of the framed photograph, fragments of memories surface – a smile captured in a moment of joy, a shared laugh frozen in time. At last, her bleeding hands come upon a now crumpled photograph, and she does her best to smooth it out on the edge of her coffee table. \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,\" she sobs to only herself, as nobody else is there to hear it. The white border of the photograph has taken on a pink hue from her bleeding hands, and the table edge catches a small rip in the paper, and the photograph tears in two. A look of horror spreads across her face, and she collapses to the ground in a pool of tears. As she cradles the torn photograph in her trembling hands, she is overcome by a wave of regret and sorrow. The image, once a cherished memory, now lies in tatters. In the silence of the empty apartment, her whispered apologies are met with only the echo of her own despair.\n\nWhen she collects herself, she gets a hand broom and a dustpan from the kitchen closet and sweeps up the glass without a word. She dumps the shards and the remains of the photograph haphazardly into the trash can beneath the sink, nearly spilling the mess right back onto the tile. She is not thinking now, but going through the motions; there isn't time to feel sorry for herself, for there is business to be done, and sinking ships to salvage. She rinses her hand in the bathroom sink and winces at the sting of the cold water hitting her wounds; it's okay, she thinks, I had it coming. When the cuts are thoroughly cleaned and free of glass, she tightly wraps them with bandages from the medicine cabinet, and dons a pair of Versace leather gloves. No sense in having to answer any unwanted questions at the office. Once she has put herself back together, she takes a deep breath, and steps out of her apartment and into the elevator. She rides down 74 floors without a word, greeting nobody that enters the small space. When she lands in the lobby, she ignores the doorman's pleasant goodbyes and steps into the cool spring air of West 61st Street. Her office is only a few blocks from her penthouse, so she feels no need to have the valet bring her car around, and resigns herself to the walk; the car will continue to gather dust in the garage. When she arrives at the agency, there will no doubt be a boardroom of sweaty yesmen waiting for her to save the day, so she will use this time to come up with a strategy. Advertising can be a cutthroat world, and she didn't become one of the best by accepting no as an answer. The Maybeline deal will be no different; somehow, she will bring them back around, even if she has to sacrifice. She is no stranger to sacrifice.\n\nOn the bustling streets of New York, one can expect to see any number of interesting characters: homeless men begging for change, a man with a box of CDs extorting people for five dollar bills, end-of-the-world prophets, and sometimes, very public arguments that are best left to the bedroom. On her daily walk to work, she has become an expert in tuning out the wider world entirely, keeping a stony expression and walking with purpose. After the morning she has had, she sinks right back into this familiar demeanor, paying no mind to the controlled chaos of city life. She walks past newspaper stands, and cardboard cutouts of superheroes, and doesn't break her steady stride when the newsboys try to catch her attention. She had set aside this particular Saturday months ago and wants to finish this business with haste so she may return to solitude in her lonely high-rise apartment. She is one block away from her office when she is stopped by traffic at the crosswalk, waiting alongside a crowd of various people for the light to turn green so she can simply get on with it. As she waits, a man approaches to her right, shepherding a little girl with golden blonde hair who could be no older than six. Atop her head is a plastic tiara that reads in big, obnoxious cursive letters \"Birthday Princess.\" The father is carrying a set of mylar balloons that could be any number of Disney princesses, but she is unsure; she hasn't kept track of princesses for some time. The father grabs his daughter's hand and pulls her closer, \"Keep near me Ava, we don't want any cars to get you on your birthday.\" Ava furrows her brow in a look that could say \"who would dare run over a princess,\" but she relents and hugs her dad's leg. \"Is this close enough daddy,\" she says with a mischievous smile, \"nobody can get me now!\" The stoplight feels as though it is lasting an eternity, and the woman begins tapping her foot restlessly. The father is looking at his daughter with an exaggerated look of exasperation that could say \"I can't take you anywhere!\" and Ava bursts into a fit of giggles. The light turns green and the father scoops up Ava in his arms and says \"Alright princess Ava, let's get you to your birthday party,\" and Ava cheers as they begin to step across the crosswalk. As she observes the interaction between the father and daughter, a voice whispers in the depths of her mind, questioning the choices that have led her to this moment. Doubt creeps in, like tendrils of smoke curling around her thoughts. She pushes these fleeting thoughts aside, but they linger at the edges of her consciousness, stirring something within her. The scene before her stirs a quiet yearning, a whisper of something lost. Memories, long buried, surface like ripples on a calm pond, hinting at what once was. She feels a pang in her chest, a fleeting sense of emptiness, as if something precious has slipped through her fingers. Yet, she brushes these feelings aside with practiced ease, burying them beneath layers of false resolve. The woman lets out a heavy sigh of relief and takes a step forward when something inside her stomach turns sour, and immense pressure falls upon her shoulders. All at once, her feet give out from under her, and she collapses to the sidewalk.\n\nShe lies flat on her back on the pavement, her arms and legs spread out in the vague shape of a snow angel, as a crowd of people gathers around her. They barrage her with a slew of concerns and questions: \"What happened? Are you okay? Do you need help?\" Outstretched hands appear all around her, and she opens her mouth to say she is fine and to leave her be when horror washes over her like a tidal wave. In a frantic and terrified voice, she screams, \"I can't move my arms! I can't move my fucking arms!\" Panic begins to consume her from the inside as she realizes she cannot move her legs either. She attempts to wiggle her fingers and toes, expecting them to remain frozen, but they do, in fact, wiggle to and fro. She comes to the conclusion that she isn't paralyzed, but she is unable to get up. It feels as though something or someone is holding her down, pinning her to the pavement. The crowd moves in closer as a million thoughts flow in and out of her whirling mind. She can move her head from side to side, but she cannot raise it. \"Help me please, somebody help me up, I can't move!\" she blurts out through desperate sobs, hoping either a good Samaritan or God will save her from this hellish moment. A large man with a bald head parts the murmuring crowd and approaches her, kneeling behind her head. \"Don't worry, ma'am, I'm going to get you to a hospital,\" he says with a confidence that implies he was ready for this exact circumstance. He begins to slide his hands under her shoulders and pauses; a puzzled look appears on his haggard face. He moves to her legs and attempts the same maneuver and again finds no purchase. He steps back, visibly deflated, and rubs his smooth head. \"I can't… I can't get my hands under you,\" he stammers, a little unsure of what he's saying. \"It's like you're glued to the ground or something.\" She shoots him a look of bewildered disbelief and practically screeches, \"What the fuck are you talking about?! Help me up, please!\" Another man pushes through the crowd, eager to do what the previous man could not, and says, \"Alright, let's get her up.\" Both men take place on either side of the woman and prepare to lift her as though they were about to move a dresser. They clutch the fabric of her jacket and pants and pull with all their might, when the fabric tears and both men tumble backward.\n\nThe crowd, now quite sizable, has begun to murmur amongst themselves, in awe of the curious spectacle. The woman has begun weeping openly, pleading for help in broken English interrupted by shuddered breath. One by one, people emerge from the crowd and attempt to lift her, and one by one, they all fail to move her even a single inch. Tears stream down her cheeks as she begs for help, her voice choked with fear and desperation. Each failed attempt to lift her only deepens her sense of helplessness, like a weight pressing down on her chest, suffocating her with dread. Arguments form in small groups about what the best course of action is, and somebody has the bright idea to call the police. After some time, the crowd disperses a bit as police officers and EMTs break through the spectacle and set up a perimeter. They too, attempt to pick up the woman, a stretcher waiting patiently nearby for her arrival, but it will remain empty. The emergency workers are no more able to lift her than the good Samaritans who tried before. All the while, the woman pleads and cries for help, a million horrible thoughts bombarding her brain. She watches as the police officers form a circle and discuss what exactly is happening here. One of the officers scratches his head, puzzled. \"I\"ve never seen anything like this,\" he mutters to his colleague. \"You think it\"s some kind of industrial adhesive?\" They resolve to cut off her clothes to free her. Out come the knives and scissors, and they surround her once more. As the paramedics cut away her clothes, she shivers in the cold air, feeling exposed and vulnerable. The once-pristine fabric of her designer jacket and luxury pants lay in tatters around her, a stark contrast to her pale skin. Lying cold and mostly nude, as a crowd looks upon her pale body, she weeps in embarrassment as the EMTs once again gather around her to lift her up, and once again, fail. They quickly discover that they are not able to pull her now ruined clothes out from under her. There is a ruckus in the audience, as news vans and reporters arrive at the scene, eager to get the scoop on this bizarre story unfolding before them. The police officers remove them from the scene rather forcibly and set up sawhorses around the perimeter, but the reporters continue to crowd around the barrier, screaming out inappropriate questions and queries. \"Ma'am, ma'am, are these police officers treating you okay?\" yells a reporter with a bad toupee, \"Ma'am, is this some kind of political statement?\" yells another with makeup so thick, you could slice it like cake. Amidst the chaos, she feels herself slipping further into shock, her thoughts a jumbled mess of disbelief and confusion. Is this really happening to her? Is it some kind of nightmare she can\"t wake up from? After a while, the police radio in for the firefighters.\n\nAs the blaring sirens of the fire trucks cut through the noise of the scene, a palpable sense of urgency grips the air. Onlookers exchange anxious glances, their murmurs growing louder with each passing moment, as the arrival of the firefighters promises a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. They enter the space with a rather large and frightening electric saw. The woman lies there speechless as they saw through the concrete, showering her in a spray of sparks that lightly singe her flesh. They cut a perfect square around her body and approach with crowbars, anchoring them beneath the isolated concrete. Ten firemen attempt to pry the piece of sidewalk up with all their might, but it doesn't move an inch. Hours go by and day creeps into night, as the rescue workers try everything they can think of: forklifts, jackhammers, even a bucket loader. Nothing works, and the woman remains pinned to the earth. She stares out of glassy eyes as the simple plans of mice and men fail again and again to free her. With each futile attempt to dislodge her from her concrete prison, the woman\"s despair deepens, mirrored in the weary faces of the firefighters. Exhausted and demoralized, they exchange worried glances that speak of their growing doubt. Her phone begins ringing constantly after a while, the sounds of Adele punctuating her nightmare, but nobody ever answers it. In the grand scheme of things, a cell phone seems like small potatoes. Amidst the backdrop of flashing lights, bystanders stand transfixed, their expressions ranging from shock to curiosity. Some exchange hushed whispers, speculating on the possibilities at play, and some whisper prayers under their breath, while others simply watch in morbid fascination. The woman feels every eye upon her. As the night bleeds into the morning, the crowd begins to thin as the police and EMTs simply give up. For some unknown reason, this woman cannot be moved, as though God were holding her down with his finger. A kind officer covers her with a blanket and feeds her by hand as she stares up at the tops of skyscrapers and the vacant blue sky. Something inside her has broken, and she no longer weeps. If there were a word she could say to release her from her prison on the sidewalk, it doesn't come.\n\nDays go by slowly at first, and then quickly become weeks. Each passing day brings with it a growing numbness, a resignation to her fate that settles like a heavy blanket over her weary soul. At first, it seems as though the media storm will never let the spectacle end, as endless news teams and reporters descend upon the woman in the early days of her confinement. They batter her with questions and theories that range from the incredibly obvious to the downright absurd, but she pays them no mind, nor does she speak a word. The police keep the area cordoned off and stay with her for the first month, feeding her regularly and changing out her blankets. They do their best to keep her comfortable, but comfort feels like such an impossible thing to grant. All the while, she does nothing and says nothing. It seems as though her natural processes have shut down; even her breath becomes weak and shallow, and yet she lives. The reporters fall away, the crowds thin ever more, and her police guards go home, returning ever so often to feed her and provide her with sources of warmth on the colder days. After the first six months, she is largely left alone. Occasional outbursts of protest erupt among activists, their voices rising in defiance against the city\"s neglect of the woman trapped in their midst. To quell them, the city votes on a measure to build an enclosure for the woman, and it narrowly passes on a vote of 26 - 25. This enclosure turns out to be little more than a canopy and a space heater. The larger world moves on, and people commute to work, stepping around the immovable woman as though she were rubbish on the sidewalk. Advertisement campaigns begin in the city at some point, attempting to draw tourism. Billboards pop up that declare in big bold letters, \"Come see the immovable woman! The greatest mystery of mankind!\" It is a big success at first, but after a few years, even the tourists stop visiting. Throughout this time, scientists from across the globe convene in symposiums and conferences, debating the intricacies of her condition and proposing wild theories to explain her inexplicable plight. They arrive in droves, bringing various indescribable instruments and attempting to discover the cause of the woman\"s imprisonment. After endless theses and countless studies, the best they can do is give it a name: Sudden Intense Gravity Syndrome, or SIGS for short. It becomes the subject of infinite conspiracy theories for many years to come. When five years go by, even the curiosity of intellectuals runs out, as all of mankind eventually grows bored with its playthings.\n\nThe woman lies silently for many days and nights. Seasons pass like clockwork, and the city continues to change and evolve while she remains still. During the harsh winter months, the city offers her additional provisions to endure the biting cold, but as time passes, interest in helping her wanes completely. She becomes akin to the numerous statues and art installations that adorn New York City; a permanent fixture, unmoving and unchanging, seamlessly melding into the broader urban landscape. The buildings don't feel her endless cold stare, and the streets don't hear her soft cries in the night, but they stand in frozen solitude alongside her. In her immobility, she retreats deeper into the recesses of her mind, seeking respite in the vast expanse of her thoughts. She spends the first few years grappling with existential questions; pondering what, why, and how her situation came to be. She gets no closer to answers than any of the scientists who studied her previously, and learns to stop asking those questions. As curious as her predicament is, even the novelty of thinking about it becomes mundane after years, so she takes to other activities to occupy her mind. She counts the windows on all the buildings she can see, and memorizes the specific birds that fly by and occasionally land on her. She observes countless cars and listens to the myriad stories of passersby, gaining an almost intimate familiarity with those whose daily routines intersect with her path most frequently. Sometimes, she ventures into her memories, often triggering moments of sadness, the soft sound of her weeping drifting down the street as tears dampen the pavement beneath her. She does not mourn for the life that has been taken away from her, for she is convinced she never deserved it.\nAfter ten years, she is completely resigned to her fate and awaits death. She wonders if anyone would even notice if she were gone. Would they simply step over her body, oblivious to her presence? And if they did notice, would they be able to remove her, or would she remain here, a permanent fixture in the city\"s landscape? Will she have a funeral, and be buried with her loved ones, or will they simply melt her away until there's nothing left? She decides that it doesn't really matter, and welcomes the day with open arms. Even if she were suddenly freed, what kind of life awaited her? Her company had likely collapsed without her leadership, her penthouse seized by creditors. She has no one waiting for her, no home to return to. What kind of existence could she carve out for herself after this? What would her quality of life be like? Her body has been overtaken by moss and fungus, her hair a matted mess that no brush could penetrate. Her skin has hardened and taken the texture of a pumice stone. Her teeth feel like jagged rocks in her mouth, beyond saving after years of neglecting them. She imagines the absurdity of a dentist attempting a root canal on a prone patient lying on the sidewalk, the thought eliciting a weary smile on her cracked lips. What a show that would be! After all, there have been greater miracles. There have also been greater nightmares. To her best knowledge, she has never been sick, and nobody has run her over. While the city fed her pretty regularly in the beginning, they stopped doing that a few years ago, and yet she never hungers or thirsts. The horrifying thought begins to gnaw at her: What if she was immortal? The idea fills her with a desperate panic. 'Can I die?\" she wonders anxiously. \"Please, God, let me die.\" The prospect of endless existence weighed heavy on her soul, a burden she couldn\"t bear. She thinks, 'There are people waiting for me, I can't be here forever!' Memories of past pain and trauma flood her mind, mingling with her current despair. She pushes them away, unwilling to confront the demons that lurk in her past. There are things she cannot bear to think about, wounds too deep to reopen. There are worse things in life than the view from the sidewalk.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Moss and lichen took root in her hair and clothes, weaving a green mantle over her once-immaculate attire. The city's inhabitants, who once gawked at her predicament, now simply walked around her. Children pointed and laughed, and adults shook their heads in disbelief. She became a living statue, an oddity that embellished their stories of New York's eccentricities. Yet, despite her appearance, her mind remained sharp as ever, processing thoughts and memories at a pace that far outstripped the pace of her life.\n\nShe had accepted her fate by now, but acceptance didn't mean surrender. It meant that she had come to terms with the reality of her circumstances, and she had chosen to make the best of it. Every day, she continued to watch the world go by, observing the lives of the people around her. She saw the joy and the pain, the love and the betrayal, the triumphs and the failures. And in watching them, she found a form of solace. It was as though she had become a part of the city herself, an invisible spectator to the grand drama of life playing out around her.\n\nOne day, as the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the cityscape, she saw a young couple walking hand in hand. They were laughing, their voices filled with pure joy. The woman watched them, her heart aching with a longing she thought she had lost. She remembered what it was like to love, to be loved, to share those moments of unguarded happiness. For a moment, she let herself feel the pain of what she had lost. But then she closed her eyes, and in the darkness, she found peace. She realized that her love, her happiness, had not been taken from her. It had merely changed form. It had become this steadfast observation of the world, this silent communion with life itself.\n\nAs the couple moved out of her view, the woman opened her eyes and looked up at the sky. The stars were beginning to twinkle, peeking out from behind the ever-dimming light pollution of the city. She found beauty in the night, in the way the stars seemed to hold secrets of the universe, whispering promises of what might be beyond. She felt a kinship with them, those distant orbs of light, trapped in their orbits, yet shining brilliantly against the backdrop of the night.\n\nAnd then, in a moment of clarity, she understood. She had not been held down by some unseen force. She had chosen to stay. She had found her own form of freedom, a freedom that was not defined by movement but by perception. She had become a witness to the world, a silent observer of the grand tapestry of life. And in this role, she found a peace that had eluded her in all her years of striving, of achieving, of never being content.\n\nYears turned into decades, and the woman remained, a fixture in the city's landscape. People came and went, seasons changed, and the city evolved around her. But she remained constant, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, a reminder of the strange and wondrous things that can happen when we choose to see the world not as it is, but as we want it to be.\n\nAnd on a day much like any other, as the sun rose in the east, casting its golden light over the city, the woman closed her eyes and thought of all the people she had watched, all the moments she had witnessed. She felt a deep sense of gratitude for the life she had lived, for the lessons she had learned, for the beauty she had found in the world, even in the most unlikely of places. And with that thought, she let go of the last vestiges of her pain and her regret, and she found peace.\n\nIn the end, the woman was not held down by gravity or fate or any other force.

{"id": "text_completion_009", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The beach was a symbol of relaxation. It was where children played in the waves while the parents relaxed in the sun. Well, the parents let themselves bake in the sun until they realized they lost their kids. Then, they panicked and searched across the sands annoying everyone. Eventually, a helpful volleyball player showed up with the kids. You thank them until. Wait, why is your spouse staring so long at that volleyball player? Sure, they look like you did younger. Well, more like a young fit version of you. Okay, they looked nothing like you did, and why was your spouse standing so close. This was a disaster. We should\"ve never came here on family vacation.\n\n\nTo most people who haven\"t had such a dramatic experience, the beach was a nice place. It represented a freedom from modern stresses and a chance to enjoy the sun. Sandcastles lined the sands like an army defending its territory. Shells were collected as if they held monetary value. Such a shame this culture was destroyed by the Mierans.\n\nHumans had always liked to take breaks, but the location was limited by time and resources. When the world was destroyed, the breaks turned into a night where two people guarded the door rather than three. The prime real estate became the pond a few blocks away to keep an eye on the supplies. Tourist traps became rusted as there was a lack of tourists to trap. Except for the dumbest people.\n\n\"Hurry up, we are going to be late,\" Polly yelled. Jim fell down the stairs. He had a beach towel on one arm and a tuxedo on his other.\n\n\"What is that for?\" Polly grabbed the pants.\n\n\"You said bring a swimsuit,\" Jim said. Polly shook her head.\n\n\"Why I am surrounded by idiots.\" She turned back to the stairs. \"Check-in ends at four pm.\"\n\n\"Isn\"t it your friend who\"s in charge?\" Olivia walked down the stairs carrying a handbag full of vacation essentials. Her dress was loose and flowing.\n\n\"He told me that he wouldn\"t make exceptions,\" Polly said.\n\n\"That makes sense. If you were my friend, I wouldn\"t make exceptions for you too,\" Olivia replied. Polly ignored her which angered Olivia.\n\n\"Reid! Frida! Get down here,\" Polly yelled. Frida ran down the stairs. She was most excited about the possibility of hunting. As such, she had a crossbow, a harpoon, and a flare. Her prey wasn\"t sharks; it was crabs. Reid followed her down in a swimsuit. With every step, he practiced flexing and posing. His body was adequate. His biceps were present, but they didn\"t bulge. If he held his breath, his torso acquired some definition. In total, he was making a fool of himself.\n\n\"I\"m ready to mingle.\" He shimmied at the bottom step. Polly and Olivia reacted with horror while Jim nodded his head.\n\n\"We\"re going to be so popular.\" Jim put his arm around Reid who shook him off.\n\n\"Just me. You can be my wingman,\" Reid said.\n\n\"Sure thing,\" Jim replied.\n\n\"Whatever, let\"s get going,\" Polly said. The five of them made their way out of their small house. The road to the vacation was long, and it took a few days travel by foot. They didn\"t plan on travel time. Fortunately, Frida was skilled at capturing beasts (some of which were mutants) and tried all plants to ensure it wasn\"t poisonous (Jim tried them as well because Frida was likely immune to all poisons). After their journey, they reached Pacifico City.\n\nIt was one of the few cities established after the war. The military ran the country, and Pacfico City wanted to cater to their needs. Multiple resorts sat close to the beach. By the resorts, there shooting ranges and ATVs for pleasure. There was an assortment of bars and restaurants as well. Each had its own signature dish or cocktail. There was one issue. The customers never came.\n\nThe upper brass couldn\"t leave. The new military was disorganized, and vacations were an opportunity to be removed by force. The soldiers were forced to stay by their commanders. If they were going to be miserable, everyone else was going to be miserable as well. The result was a sad city filled with abandoned resorts. The weapons and ATVs were stolen by raiders who put it to better use. The bars and restaurants had their supplies looted, and the workers moved on.\n\nThe vacation house in question was a dingy hotel far from the beach. When the five arrived, a man sat behind the desk with his mouth open. A fly flew in and out of it. There was a wall with keys behind him. The man didn\"t react when they entered. He did perk up when Polly hit the bell on his desk.\n\n\"Welcome to Tropical Fun. You missed check-in time,\" he said.\n\n\"Rick, it\"s me. Can\"t you make an exception,\" Polly replied.\n\n\"Check-in ends at four. It\"s half past five.\" Rick pointed at the clock. Olivia looked down.\n\n\"That clock isn\"t moving,\" she said. Rick looked down.\n\n\"Oh, I\"ve only been working here for a few months. I inherited it from my uncle. He died in a mutant iguana attack,\" Rick said.\n\n\"Sorry for your loss,\" Polly said.\n\n\"Don\"t be. I hated him.\" Rick turned around. He gave them two keys. Before arriving, it was agreed that Olivia would get a room by herself. Reid and Polly were okay with this because Jim and Frida slept on the floor. The floor was preferrable when they saw their rooms. Reid\"s bed was simultaneously too hard and too soft, Polly\"s was always wet, and Olivia\"s had mutant bed bugs. The rooms smelled like burnt cabbage. The bathrooms were filled with flies and rodents.\n\n\"Well this is a disaster.\" Reid looked out the window. \"There\"s no one here to enjoy my show.\"\n\n\"Their loss.\" Olivia was hiding in the other room because she was scared of bugs. She wouldn\"t let them know.\n\n\"No, every cloud has a silver lining.\" Reid turned with a smile on this face. \"We are going to restore this city to its former glory.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

They started by visiting the abandoned resorts, the old shooting ranges, and the bars. The sight of decay and neglect was disheartening, but it fueled their determination to bring life back to the town.\n\nThey met locals who shared their stories of hardship, loss and hope. Among them, there were people who believed in the city's potential and were already trying to rebuild it. Their stories inspired Reid, Polly, and the others even more. They realized that to bring the city back, they needed to unite the people, find common ground and work together.\n\nAs they explored, they stumbled upon a group of mutants who were living in the ruins of an old amusement park. The group was led by a mutant named Max, who had a profound impact on Reid. Max was a brilliant inventor, and his creations were unlike anything Reid had seen before. They were eco-friendly and designed to help humans and mutants coexist. Max welcomed the group and invited them to stay.\n\nWhile Polly and Olivia helped Max to organize the park and make it habitable, Reid and Frida started to build alliances with other mutants and people around the city. They needed a plan to turn things around. Jim on the other hand, started working on a way to bring the upper brass to Pacifico City. He believed that if he could convince them to see the potential of the city, they would send troops to help.\n\nWeeks passed and the group's efforts began to pay off. The amusement park became a popular spot for both humans and mutants. Max's inventions caught the attention of the locals and travelers. Slowly, people started to return to Pacifico City. The shooting ranges and ATV tracks were reopened, and new bars and restaurants were established.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim's plan to bring the upper brass to the city worked. They saw the potential of Pacifico City and sent soldiers to help with the reconstruction. The city began to flourish once again. The once dead city was now a beacon of hope and unity.\n\nThe group's vacation turned into a life-changing experience. They realized that with determination, hard work, and unity, anything was possible. They returned home with new friendships, memories, and a sense of accomplishment. They had helped to rebuild a city and, in doing so, had made a difference in the world.\n\nThe beach, once a symbol of relaxation, now represented a triumph of human spirit and unity. It was a place where everyone could come together, forget their differences, and enjoy the beauty of nature. And as Reid stood on the shore, watching the sun set, he knew that Pacifico City would continue to grow and flourish, a shining example of what can be achieved when people work together.\n\nAs they prepared to leave, Polly looked at Rick, the hotel clerk, who had become a friend during their stay. \"You know, Rick, Pacifico City is going to be great. I think you'll enjoy living here.\"\n\nRick smiled, his fly-infested clock now replaced with a working one. \"I think you're right, Polly. Pacifico City has some big things in store. And I'm glad I was here to witness it all.\" \n\nWith that, they walked away from the beach, but they left a part of their hearts in Pacifico City, a testament to the power of hope, unity, and determination.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text by preserving the tone and character development.

{"id": "text_completion_010", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Deep within the bowels of the University of Greyvein, in a far-removed corner of the library, sat two novice scholars with their noses deep in dusty tomes. Ferin, a frigid young man in his early twentieth year, sat hunched over, scanning the pages of an old book detailing predators in Naiadara. Beside him, Rodrick scribbled furiously on a wrinkled yellow notebook, copying the words from another book without bothering to understand them. His beaky nose and strange haircut made him stand out among the other scholars, but not in a good way. Ferin only tolerated his presence because he was the only other Water Wielder among the novice scholars.\n\n\nFerin glanced at Rodrick with a scowl, crossing his arms and leaning away from him, barely hiding his frustration. He slammed another book shut, adding it to the pile of useless texts on the table. He crumpled the parchment in his hand, feeling the ink smudge on his fingers. He had spent hours poring over the books, but none of them had the answers he sought.\n\n*Nothing I can use at least,* Ferin thought. *I need something that will impress them.* He wasn't sure who he was referring to.\n\nA sudden movement in his peripheral vision causes Ferin to look to his right and see a man in swishy dark robes walk past the mouth of the aisle with speed. Turning back to his book, he rereads a line about the hunting habits of apex predators.\n\n\"Good afternoon gentlemen. You're the two novice Water Invokers, right\"\n\nBoth men were surprised by the gravelly voice, turning slowly to face the source, who stood leaning on Ferin's chair with one arm. \"Yes…\" Rodrick answers timidly. \"And you are?\" Ferin kicked his foot under the desk, gesturing with a sharp eye motion to the gold insignia etched into his loose black sleeves.\n\n*I can't say I've ever seen a High Scholar wear those colours before*, Ferin thought. The man looked young at first glance, but the deep facial creases and streaks of grey betrayed his true age.\n\nRodrick dropped his head. \"My apologies Venerable Scholar. What do you need of us?\"\n\n\"I am High Scholar Amren. Eminence Barik, your superior, informs me you are Invokers? If so, I have a little invitation I think you'll be interested in. Are either of you familiar with the Arbiter?\"\n\n\"As in the Traverser?\" Ferin asked. Nervously, he fidgeted with the small sky-blue gem dangling on a chain earring. \"I read about it, but I didn't think it was real.\"\n\n\"You'd be partially justified for believing that based on what some of those dusty tomes might say. It has been dormant for a long time, but it has recently been detected in the jungle of Northern Ashijan. If you can tolerate the three days it'll take to walk there, there will be great reward in locating it.\" The man spoke a bit above a whisper. \"Wealth and influence as scholars for sure, and if you manage to make a deal with it, you would have access to the most powerful Traverser in all Naiadara.\"\n\n\"Why us?\" Ferin asked, narrowing his eyes. \"Wouldn't the other High Scholars want to keep this under wraps?\" He didn't trust the High Scholar's smile. There had to be a catch.\n\nThis time it was Rodrick\"s turn to kick. \"Don't be rude, Ferin. The business of the High Scholars is their own.\" He grinned at the High Scholar, not caring about the consequences. \"What he means to say is that we are interested and that he knows not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Right, Ferin?\"\n\nFerin's eyes flickered to the window, where he imagined his parents finally welcoming him home. He swallowed hard and nodded. Facing the man again, he forced out a reply, his voice cracking slightly. \"Yes, we are interested. How hard do you think it will be?\"\n\n*It seems almost too good to be true*, he thought. *But even on the off chance it is… I could get them out of that hovel, and secure a good life for them.*\n\nIt was vain, and he knew it, but his interest had been piqued and found he had already made his decision. Turning back to the man, he said, with a hint of doubt in his voice, \"Yes, we are interested. How hard do you think it will be?\"\n\nHigh Scholar Amren withdrew a small folded page of parchment containing a detailed image of a small section of the jungle where the Arbiter can be found. With a hopeful smile and a scratchy voice, he said, \"I don't think there will be much struggle.\"\n\nWithout another word, he walked back up the aisle and around the corner. Ferin looked at Rodrick, both of them quickly processing what just occurred before promptly gathering their belongings from the desk and hurrying up the aisle and out of the library toward the dormitory. After pausing at Ferin's door, they decide to pack their belongings today for an early departure, and Rodrick hurries off to his room.\n\nA few moments after Ferin began to pack, his door bangs open to admit Rodrick, who closes the door and pauses to catch his breath before asking an inane question about shoes. Ferin began to ask him to leave when the door banged open for a second time, this time to reveal their instructor, Eminence Barik. A plump man with entirely too much weight on his hips and a shiny bald head currently the same pink as his exasperated face.\n\n\"What is all this running about?\" He demanded. \"I saw you both burst in here like tubby children in a candy store! What's gotten you so riled up?\"\n\nHe paused briefly, looking at the paper on the desk and then at Ferin, who was motionless with a bag in one hand, a pair of pants in the other, and a small heap of clothes and other items on his bed. Then he looked at Rodrick, who was holding a different pair of shoes in either hand and back at Ferin.\n\n\"Why does it look like you are going somewhere?\"\n\nRodrick spoke before Ferin could. \"We were given a task by a High Scholar to seek a Traverser in Ashijan.\" His face was a few shades paler than usual and he stood at attention, clasping his hands behind his back with enough force to send a shoe flying from his grip.\n\nBarik paid it no mind.\n\n\"A High Scholar? Ashijan?\" Barik repeated incredulously. His eyes suddenly sharpened like a hawk\"s, and he darted to the paper on the desk, barely beating Ferin to it. He scanned it for a moment before Ferin yanked it out of his grasp, but it was too late. \"The Arbiter? But that's…no…hold on. Wait right here. You do not have permission to leave until I have it in writing or else I will have you expelled!\"\n\nHe dashed out of the room and down the hall, likely to the High Scholar's audience chamber. Ferin's heart thundered in his ears as he assessed his options as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter coming to an uneasy decision, he said, \"Rodrick, if you're coming, pack everything you need in the next five minutes and meet me by the southernmost gate. We leave now, not tomorrow.\"\n\n\"But-\" He began.\n\n\"Do as you will. I will wait two minutes and then I will leave. With or without you.\" Ferin said sharply, not even looking at the other man as he continued shoving bits of clothing into his bag.\n\nRodrick said nothing else as he sprinted out of the room. Ferin forced himself to be as meticulous as possible while packing to distract himself from the tingling anxiety building in his chest. Not that he's nervous about going, but because he is unsure if he just made a mistake allowing Rodrick to come alongside him.\n\n*If it comes down to him or me, he won't get in my way.*\n\nFerin was finished with his bag, and just before leaving, he paused, pulling open the bottom drawer of his desk and withdrawing a small rectangular wooden box from underneath a stack of books. Within, submerged in water from this morning\"s high tide, was an earring with a grape-size arctic blue gem attached to a short silver chain. The gem on both earrings is known as an Ego and is crucial for all elemental magical Wielding, including Ferin's Invoking.\n\nFerin felt far more confident sensing the larger gem swing, knowing it was money well spent despite spending literally everything he owned to buy it. Ferin\"s gaze flickered to the faded portrait of his family on his desk; the only copy they had between them. The potential of providing for them and proving his worth as an Invoker and Scholar fuelled a newfound determination. The sudden well of power tugging at his ear was momentarily disconcerting but he pushed it out of his mind before rushing out of the room.\n\nAfter a speedy walk, he arrives at the southern exit from the University grounds. It was a tall wrought iron gate, part of a taller perimeter wall, that Ferin chose due to its immediate proximity to a small pond.\n\nBehind trees, he quickly dropped his belongings, using a smooth stone to hastily write a note to his family telling them he would be away for a few days but that he felt this was finally his moment. Tying the note with twine, he creeps to the nearby water.\n\nAs he submerged his right hand, Eo, the pent-up magical energy within the Ego, rushed into him. The gem at his ear glowed brightly from within. A surge of power coursed through his body like a riptide, radiating off his skin and warping like hot air above a campfire. The pond responded, its surface rippling with an iridescent sheen.\n\nClosing his eyes, he senses Naiadara, the wellspring dimension fuelling all Water Wielding and housing the creatures Invokers summon. Seconds later, he feels a pushback on his magic, indicating his bait has been taken. The pond ceased to be just water; it became a gateway to a hidden world. It was no longer a mere surface but a doorway to Naiadara, the manifestation of his Invoking ability to pierce through the veil between realms.\n\nHe opened his eyes just in time to see a blurred shape shooting upward and landing behind Ferin with a wet thump.\n\nTurning, he examined the Traverser—a bulky amphibian creature, perched on strong hopping legs, with a flat shell, snapping beak, and toadlike dark blue-grey skin. The Croakshell stared blankly at him, awaiting a command, but Ferin ignored it for now.\n\nGetting up, Ferin harnessed the pond\"s lingering Eo, dismissing the portal and raising a water sphere above his head with a sweep of his hand. His focus intensified, and he immersed his senses into Naiadara once more. Delicately, he sought his target, detecting its erratic movements responding to the subtle allure of his Eo bait. The ball began to shrink into itself, its centre darkening before ballooning outward. With a satisfying pop, the bubble burst, revealing a small Traverser hovering above the trees.\n\n\"A Flitterfly!\"\n\nFerin nearly yelped, turning to see Rodrick looking excitedly upward at the creature, a slightly bulbous bag slung on his back and kept in place with a brown strap across his chest.\n\n\"Keep it down or I will leave you behind,\" Ferin hissed. \"I need it to deliver a note and we can leave. I want to get as much of a head start as possible before night falls.\"\n\nHe turned his attention back to the Flitterfly, giving it a mental command to land on his arm. With its speed and sense of direction, this Traverser was the Naiadara equivalent of a carrier pigeon, making it useful for delivering messages. It had shimmering sky-blue scales and pointed dorsal and caudal fin alongside two insectoid eyes with two sets of wide membranous wings that flapped faster than the eye could see.\n\nIt grabbed the rolled note with its two front legs before kicking off with its remaining four, whizzing through the sky toward his parents\" farm an hour north of the Greyvein city walls. Ferin hoped his parents would read his note, but he had a nagging feeling that he should've gone to see them himself.\n\n*I don't want to think about that right now. Just focus on the trip.*\n\nQuickly closing the distance, Rodrick stuck his face uncomfortably close. \"Is that a new Ego? I thought the gem was smaller before.\"\n\n\"It was.\" Ferin said, pulling it out of his ear while taking a cautious step back. \"This is a Grade Two that I paid through the nose to get.\" He traced his fingers over the gem, seeing its once-bright hue had darkened into a deep azure, perfectly mirroring the shade of Ferin's eyes.\n\n\"I wish I had one that nice. I'm stuck with the basic one the University loaned me.\" Rodrick moaned ignorantly.\n\n\"Work as hard as I do and you'll get there one day.\"\n\n\"You know everyone calls both of us 'The Piddles', right?\"\n\n\"Shut up, Piddles. Let's get moving.\"\n\nThe pair walked out of the University grounds and into the bustle of the city with the Traverser hopping alongside them. They had to push their way through, but the crowds helped immensely to conceal them and their batrachian companion, who had no issue weaving through the people to stay as close as possible. Ferin kept the parchment from the High Scholar on his person at all times because, without it, they would have no chance of locating The Arbiter or the riches at the end.\n\nThe gaggle of guards posted at the city gate gave them a quizzical look, first for their novice scholar robes, and then for the remarkably strange animal accompanying them, but allowed them both to pass without any hassle.\n\n*Probably because we're leaving instead of entering*, Ferin thought humorously. But he still did not dare lower his guard yet. Just because they had escaped the confines of the city hardly guaranteed their safe passage. *The University is certainly preparing to send a force after us, for if the information I carry is true…*\n\nFerin shuddered, suddenly feeling the implications of his actions. He clenched his teeth and hoped, with every fiber of his being, that he was not embarking on a fool's errand. However, Ferin was so absorbed in these thoughts that he failed to notice the mental link to his Flitterfly forcibly severed before reaching the city limits.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The road north was long and twisting, with the sun sinking lower each evening until Ferin and Rodrick were enveloped in the comforting dusk. The landscape began to change from the city's sprawl and farmland to dense forests and rocky outcroppings. Ferin led the way, with Rodrick often lagging behind, his breaths coming in rapid huffs. The Croakshell's leaps, however, were a marvel to watch, and he'd find himself catching up quickly, the Traverser's legs pumping furiously over the uneven terrain.\n\nThroughout the journey, the two novice scholars faced a variety of challenges, from hostile wildlife to sudden, heavy rainstorms that tested their waterproof clothing. Despite the hardships, they had no choice but to press on, fuelled by the tantalizing promise of wealth and influence. Ferin, ever the more practical of the two, kept his focus on the path ahead, while Rodrick's mind often strayed to the fantastic and the fantastical, dreaming of what wonders they might encounter and what secrets they might uncover.\n\nThe third day of their journey was the most taxing. Ferin's map, though detailed and accurate, had not prepared them for the treacherous terrain they found themselves in. Massive boulders littered the ground, forcing them to climb and leap with greater care. The Croakshell, though nimble, had to carry them at times, his broad back just wide enough to sustain both their weights.\n\nAs the sun shimmered low on the horizon, Ferin's gaze grew sharp with a mixture of determination and apprehension. He could feel the energy of the jungle, pulsating with an ancient rhythm. They were close.\n\nWhen the darkness of the forest blanketed them, they made camp beneath a copse of wide-leaved trees, Rodrick drawing a map in the dirt with a twig while Ferin set up a small fire. The flames cast flickering shadows over the two, giving the woods an ominous hue. Ferin could sense Rodrick's apprehension, but he remained silent, staring into the fire. They needed to conserve their energy for the morrow.\n\nThe next morning, as dawn touched the sky with hues of pink and gold, they set off again, winding deeper into the jungle. The air was humid and thick, and the sounds of wildlife grew louder with each step. Tall trees stretched their boughs into the sky, blocking most sunlight, and the forest floor was a tangle of roots and fallen foliage. It seemed impossible to navigate, yet Ferin's instincts, honed by countless hours of study, guided them deeper.\n\nMidday arrived, and with it came an unexpected visitor. A small, glistening entity, no larger than a fist, flitted through the air, its translucent wings shimmering with the spectrum of colors. It hovered before Ferin, who recognized it instantly as a Naiadara Traverser called a Lightweaver, known to guide lost travelers.\n\nFerin's heart leapt. This was a sign. The Arbiter would be found. He reached out and gently cupped the Lightweaver, feeling its tiny form tremble in his palm. Carefully, he whispered a request, asking it to show them the way.\n\nThe Lightweaver responded without words, its body pulsating with a soft, warm light. With a fleeting touch to Ferin's hand, it flew off, leading them deeper into the jungle. The two followed, trusting the tiny Traverser to guide them to their destiny.\n\nTheir journey took them through denser foliage, past streams and small waterfalls, until, at last, they emerged into a clearing. The air here was cooler, and the canopy above shimmered with a soft, ethereal light that seemed to come from within the foliage itself.\n\nIn the center of the clearing, they saw it—The Arbiter, a creature of Naiadara, both terrifying and magnificent. It was a gargantuan entity, its body a mix of stone and aquatic flesh, with large, muscular arms and a head crowned in razor-sharp spikes. Its eyes glowed with an inner light, surveying the world around it.\n\nFerin's breath caught in his chest. The Arbiter was real, and it was more incredible than he had ever imagined. He glanced at Rodrick, whose face was a mask of awe and fear, but he too remained rooted to the spot, unable to look away from the creature.\n\nThen, the Arbiter spoke, its voice echoing through the clearing, powerful and commanding. The words were a mix of ancient dialects, but Ferin understood the gist. It sought to test them, to prove their worthiness before granting their wish.\n\nThe challenge was set. They would need to complete a task, one of great peril, to prove that they were indeed worthy. Ferin felt a surge of determination, fueled by the promise of what lay ahead. He looked at Rodrick, who nodded resolutely, ready to face whatever came.\n\nThe challenge was a puzzle, one that required both their minds and their abilities as Water Invokers. They worked together, combining their knowledge and their power, until, at long last, the task was completed, and the Arbiter acknowledged their worthiness.\n\nIn that moment, Ferin felt a shift within himself. He was no longer just a novice scholar; he was something more. The Arbiter granted them their wish—wealth, influence, and the power to traverse Naiadara at will. But more than that, it granted them the knowledge and the wisdom to use their powers wisely.\n\nAs they left the clearing, Ferin felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The journey had been fraught with danger, but the rewards were beyond anything he had ever imagined. He glanced at Rodrick, who was smiling broadly, and knew that together, they could achieve great things.\n\nWith the Arbiter's blessing, they set off back the way they came, their hearts full of hope and their minds brimming with new knowledge. The journey home, though long and difficult, was filled with whispered plans and dreams of the future. They would return to Greyvein as heroes, with wealth and influence beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nBut more than that, they would return as masters of their craft, ready to face whatever challenges came their way. They had proven themselves worthy, and the world would soon see what they were capable of.\n\nFerin looked at Rodrick, who was still grinning, and knew that this was only the beginning.

He has to make this. Pause occurs as the two stay silent a second.\n\n\n*... Go home, or learn how to exorcize ghosts? This... this is a lot... I...* Zita nervously thinks, trying to figure out what is right.\n\nSylvie sorely sighs in response to this.\n\n\"... I\"ll give you time. Check back with you in fifteen minutes. Think long and hard. Sorry.\"\n\nAnd with that announcement, Sylvie vanishes behind the bars and leaves Zita on his own. He thinks long and hard about this decision.\n\n*... I... I want to leave. I want to go home, I want to hang out with Pip, go to school, go to bed, I want to pretend none of this ever happened! I want to live an ordinary life and study, I don\"t want to be involved in any of this, it\"s all... but... I... I will be seeing these ghosts everywhere, whether I stay or not. I\"ll have to witness them, but not know a thing about them or why they\"re here.

I want to see it, I have to, but... urgh… how did I end up in this mess?*\n\nZita ponders the dilemma more, staring at the floor with locked hands as he argues with himself, wondering how he got into this mess and if he's still dreaming. He can't decide if the fifteen minutes felt like 15 seconds or 15 hours, but they end either way and the strange woman is back. She stands before him with crossed arms for a second before asking the big question.\n\n\"... so? You made your choice?\" a pause washes over the two, but Zita's lip parts and the answer emerges.\n\n\"... yeah... I... I think I have.\" Zita responds, anxiety and caution in his tone. He gulps before sealing his fate, giving the verdict on his life;\n\n\"I... I want to learn about ghosts. and what to do about them.\"\n\nWith that response, Sylvie gives a confident smile as the cell bars retract and upward, rising and letting Zita out of the cage.\n\n\"... Atta boy. Let\"s get started.\" a proud smirk across her face as Zita steps out into the light, a nervous smile across his face as he follows the woman outside the cage.\n\n\"Now, lets begin!\" Sylvie enthusiastically declares as they walk out of a white-plastered cottage that you wouldn\"t guess to be the front for an underground holding facility. Before the two is a shiny black car.\n\n\"... s... so, where do we... start?\" Zita asks Sylvie in a shy tone.\n\n\"Well~ first, it would be smart for you to get some first hand experience. You\"ll be assisting us on an exorcism! We\"ll tell you more when we get there.\" The black car\"s back door opens to reveal a woman in the same robe he saw the previous person wear, but with their hood down. She has lengthy raven black hair in a braided ponytail and small facial features. Her eyes widen from shock as she sees the boy in front of the car.\n\n\"Oh- he actually took the option?\" The driver states in a surprised tone before clearing her voice. The black haired girl stares at him with a shocked look. Zita replies with an awkward lopsided smile.\n\n\"As I said, I teach this one. You\"ll be her classmate, if that\"s alright. And if it ain\"t, sorry, not much to do about it.\" Sylvie says as she walks to the shotgun side of the car. Zita slowly takes a seat and gives a small wave to the girl.\n\n\"... what… are you doing here?\" She scowls at the boy next to her.\n\n\"... I... I want to learn about the ghosts...\"\n\n\"I...\" the girl stares at Sylvie with an annoyed look and crosses her arms in a sulk. The driver in the front, a woman with a blonde bob cut turns the keys as the car rattles, starting and beginning to move not long after.\n\n*... the awkwardness hurts, I... yikes. How am I already regretting this, before I've even met a ghost nonetheless?*\n\nThe road trip that follows amplifies the awkwardness to levels that the 2 didn\"t even know was possible. The driver remains quiet for most of the journey, whilst Sylvie hums to the radio. Meanwhile, the two in the back don\"t even say a word, the girl in the back staring out the window at the world passing by whilst Zita thinks of anything to say. Finally, Sylvie speaks.\n\n\"Oh- right. Zita, this is Assira Kaguya. Assira, Zita! Both of you will be learning from me during this crash course, so get along nicely!\" Sylvie informs.\n\n\"Y- yes, miss!\" Zira nods as he responds, talking anxiously.\n\n\"... yes, miss...\" Assira responds, sounding like she\"s talking through gritted teeth, making Zita even more uncomfortable.\n\nThe black car travels quite some distance, the destination leads to the people inside weaving through the Welsh countryside, tracing the roads lining the valleys. The long journey gives Zita a lot of time to think.\n\n*... What... What just happened? Why did it happen? How did it happen? Did... did I fall down the stairs in the bunker and this is all one big concussion dream? Would make more sense than being suffocated by thin air and the creepy statue taking a rock to my head... not to mention what the hell this creepy woman was talking about, aether and plasm and... look, I\"ll just... go with it. I have to know. I\"ll regret it if I don\"t.*\n\n\"So, Zita!\" Sylvie announces to the boy. \"We will be going on a mission, learning first hand. We\"ll help, of course.\"\n\n\"W- why so soon?\" Zita asks.\n\n\"Aether comes from aetherplasm, which spawns from negative emotions. Mainly the fight or flight response. The best way to unlock aether control is through life or death stress!\" Sylvie talks about life or death as naturally as she breathes, prompting Zita to develop an expression of shock and fear.\n\n\"B- but I don\"t want to die!-\"\n\n\"You won\"t~ you\"ll live! We\"ll be here to protect you!\"\n\n\"... o... okay...\" sweat rolls down Zita\"s face as he finds that cold comfort. After this exchange, the driver speaks.\n\n\"Miss, if you may debrief...\" the driver asks Sylvie.\n\n\"Rrrright people! Here\"s the summary of what\"s happened and whatcha gonna do. whatcha need to know; This mineshaft is known to be haunted.\" The lady says, as if what she is saying is completely standard to the two in the back. Assira simply nods with a blank face, robe hood down. Meanwhile, Zira is still taking time to adjust.\n\n\"Now then, this mineshaft...\" Sylvie continues whilst twiddling with the branch in her hair, twisting it in her locks. \"It all started in the 1900\"s, dead early in it too. A mines owner did not pay enough on safety precautions because \"mah monah.\"\" She breaks up the serious topic with a goofy voice when talking about the money. \"Due to this oversight, an coaldust incident and poor scaffolding caused portions of shaft to collapse, burying the miners still inside.\" Sylvie explains this tragedy in a casual and nonchalant way, resting her arm against the top of her seat whilst talking to the two students. \"Ok then, Assira!\" The teacher says to the girl, raising their index finger as she talks. \"Pop quiz! Our new friend here just learned about ghosts and aether existing, so I\"ll test your knowledge and give our new guy here a crash course. Got it?\"\n\n\"Understood, miss.\" The robed girl responds in a stoic and formal tone, if annoyed by their teacher\"s silly tone. Zita just sits there, a bit concerned as he twitchily nods and prepares to listen.\n\n\"Now! How are ghosts formed?\" The teacher asks.\n\n\"Simple. Negative emotions radiate from living people in the form of an energy known as aetherplasm. Said energy then imprinting itself on surrounding objects and ground. human souls transfer into aetherplasm during traumatic deaths. Eventually the aetherplasm in the ground attracts each other, assumes the identity of the negative emotion and collective thoughts that created it, and begins to operate as a ghost. It will also attract negative emotions linked to the identity it assumed.\"\n\n\"Ding ding ding! Full marks! You got all that...? sorry, didn\"t get your last name.\" The teacher turns to Zita, her jovial attitude turning to a more curious one when asking the boy.\n\nThe boy turns to her nervously and stutters; \"U-uh, it\"s malik, miss... Zita Malik. and, yeah, I think I understand... so manifestations of bad memories and fears, in short?\"\n\nThe teacher looks to the ceiling whilst thinking about that name, as if remembering something. \"Zita, huh... I like it! Anyway, yeah, that\"s a good way to put it!\" The teacher responds, then clicks her fingers.\n\n\"Anyway, people like us- those who have been touched by aether by birth or events- can manipulate our aetherplasm to create aether, a more controllable form, the soul made plasma. Plus, access to aether allows us to perceive ghosts, something normal people can\"t. Also, We can manipulate our aether in many ways, everyone has their own individual method and technique. I\"m sure you\"ll see it from Assira. On your mission\" The teacher explains, then turns to the girl in question. \"Speaking of, Assira. I trust you to look after our new recruit. You got him into this mess, so I trust you to look out for him whilst here.\" The teacher states in a more serious tone, yet still informal. Assira's eyes widen in frustration and she goes to speak back, but doesn\"t open her mouth.\n\n\"Yes, miss...\" she responds, tone radiating frustration. Zita watches, quietly, not wanting to say anything on the matter...\n\nZita\"s head is on fire and his stomach is in knots as he waits for the journey to end. He didn\"t know what the hell he\"s done to deserve being in this situation other than to be curious, but...\n\n*I made this bed, guess it\"s time to lie in it!* he figured begrudgingly.\n\nAfter an hour, the car pulls through an rickety metal fence, driving through a blackened and coal dust covered road and parks in the middle of an abandoned early 1900\"s coal mine. Derelict minecarts and eroded railways line the floor, scaffold towers flake rust and stand with wheels atop and dusty chimneys litter the skyline, the glum scenery emphasized by the signature welsh clouds hanging overhead. The students walk out the back of the car, Assira hastily slamming the door behind them and into Zita whom blocks it with an alarmed expression. The teacher walks out and leans against the car\"s driver side door and crosses their arms, the driver opening the window.\n\n\"We\"ll be out here standing guard. If something comes up, I\"ll be there in a split. I trust you though, you two got this. best of luck!\" The teacher says to her pupils, smiling and with a cheery tone.\n\n\"Good luck, you two.\" The driver says, slightly more detached yet hopefully as the two begin to approach the pits.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The duo of students approach the mine entrance slowly as the teacher and driver remain behind to monitor the situation. The air grows colder, and the darkened mine entrance looms large as Zita and Assira step closer, their footsteps echoing off the walls.\n\n\"So, Zita Malik, huh?\" Assira breaks the silence, her tone still somewhat frosty. \"First thing you should know is that I didn't sign up for this babysitting gig. So, don't get any ideas about being a damsel in distress.\"\n\nZita raises his hands, palms out, in a gesture of surrender. \"I really didn't ask for this either. But here we are. So, let's just... not be enemies, okay?\"\n\nAssira rolls her eyes and mutters something unkind under her breath, but doesn't push it further. \"Fine. But if you screw up, don't expect me to save your ass. Got it?\"\n\nZita nods, his anxiety still high. \"Got it. So, what's our first step?\"\n\nAssira draws her hood over her head and adjusts her robe, her serious demeanor in stark contrast to the teacher's light-heartedness. \"First, we need to locate the disturbance. The aether here is thick, so it shouldn't be hard to find. Just follow my lead.\"\n\nStepping into the darkness, Assira pulls a small device from her pocket—a wand-like object with a glowing orb at its tip. She activates it with a push of a button, and it begins to hum with a soft light. \"This will help us see through the shadows.\"\n\nMoving deeper into the mine, the air grows heavier, and the silence is suffocating. The walls are adorned with streaks of coal dust and the occasional mining tool left behind by long-departed workers. The sound of dripping water echoes through the passages, an eerie symphony to the tension that hangs in the air.\n\n\"Here,\" Assira stops suddenly, pointing to a spot on the floor where the coal dust is more disturbed than usual. \"The aether is strongest here. I can feel it. It's almost as if something is trying to break through.\"\n\nZita swallows hard, forcing himself to stay calm. \"What do we do now?\"\n\n\"Focus on your aether,\" Assira instructs, closing her eyes and placing her hands together. Slowly, a soft glow begins to emanate from her body—an eerie, violet light. \"We need to send it back. Imagine the aether as a living entity. You need to communicate with it, gently persuade it to return.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zita closes his eyes and follows Assira's lead, trying to imagine the aether as a tangible thing. At first, his mind is blank, but gradually, he begins to feel a presence, a tingling sensation running through his body. He opens his eyes to see violet light emanating from his hands, matching Assira's.\n\nTogether, they extend their hands toward the spot where the aether is strongest, and Zita feels a strange connection to it—a tug, almost like gravity. The light from their hands grows brighter, and the disturbance on the floor begins to swirl, forming a transparent figure—a ghost.\n\nZita's heart races as he stares at the ghostly figure, a mix of fear and fascination washing over him. The ghost looks back at him, its expression one of confusion and pain. Assira steps forward, her voice calm and soothing.\n\n\"Go back, now. Return to where you should be. Find peace.\"\n\nThe ghost seems to understand, its form growing fainter, its grip on the world weakening. Finally, with a shimmer, it dissipates, returning to the aether.\n\nAssira opens her eyes and sighs in relief. \"It's done. That was easier than I thought.\"\n\nZita, still catching his breath, looks at Assira with newfound respect. \"Thank you for teaching me. I... I think I'm starting to get it.\"\n\nAssira nods, her expression softening slightly. \"Good. You'll need it, especially if you're going to stick around. Come on, let's get out of here before anything else decides to make an appearance.\"\n\nAs they make their way back to the car, Zita can't help but feel a sense of purpose that he didn't know he was missing. Despite the fear and the uncertainty, he feels a connection to something greater, something that he never knew existed.\n\n*This isn't the ordinary life I was dreaming of, but maybe... maybe this is where I belong. Maybe this is what I was meant to do all along.* he thinks, a newfound determination burning within him.\n\nAs they step out of the mine and into the light, Zita knows that his journey is just beginning. The road ahead is still unclear, but one thing is certain—he's ready to face it head-on.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, preserving the plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_012", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Fort Spencer was supposed to be a place to retire. It was where the only war games were Risk and Battleship. Training exercises consisted of deciding to get out of bed at the right opportunity. The staff catered to the officers every need. So why did command give them a fleet of submarines.\n\n\n\"There must\"ve been a mistake.\" Captain Ryan Olaberria was glad to have been posted at Fort Spencer. No other fort in the nation had a captain as its highest officer. Half of the postings technically outranked, but they took the demotion for less responsibility. There was little risk of handling combat, it had no towns within its jurisdiction, and there was no risk of demerits.\n\n\"I called the commander. Apparently, these vessels are from pre-war times, and they want us to test them in our lake.\" Lieutenant Lilly Jones was the opposite of the captain. She hated the serene and peaceful Fort Spencer. She wanted a posting that involved adventure and combat. On her first tour, there was an incident involving a sock and a jammed rifle. From that point forward, she was trapped in servicing old soldiers. \"Also, they are not submarines. They are technically submersibles. They aren\"t self-sufficient at all. Most weren\"t even armed until the Mieran war, and the aliens unleashed who knows what in the seas.\" Lieutenant Jones smiled at that thought. She had romantic notions of war. It was easy to hold such ideals when one had been routinely denied the battlefield.\n\n\"So we don\"t have to use them. Just test them to make sure they work?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"That\"s correct.\"\n\n\"Do we have any guidance or timetable with regards to the submersibles?\"\n\n\"Command gave us free reign. They might come by a few years from now.\"\n\nCaptain Jacob smiled and scratched his chin. The retirees were getting bored with the standard activities and diet. It was why they were all so willing to believe that Pacifico City lie a while back. They needed something new.\n\n\"Perhaps we could define function as taking these submersibles out for a few joyrides. I\"m sure they\"ll be quite enjoyable,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"Will these joyrides be able to test the capabilities of the weapons?\"\n\n\"Who cares about that? Command asked if they worked. We can turn them all back over and say they swim fine,\" Captain Olaberria smiled. The lieutenant was angered that another weapon was going to be wasted for entertainment purposes. She desperately wanted to use the submersibles to their full power, but she knew that wasn\"t going to stand with the current situation.\n\n\"There\"s one problem,\" Ryan said. Lilly raised an eyebrow in the hopes that Ryan had a change of heart.\n\n\"If these submersibles break, that could kill several of the retirees that we need to keep alive.\"\n\n\"Darn, looks like your submersible ride idea was a bust.\" Lilly could hardly contain her excitement.\n\n\"No, it can be salvaged.\"\n\n\"I\"m not sure about that. The crafts were already salvaged.\"\n\n\"Someone needs to test them before we give them to the people that matter.\" Ryan scratched his chin. \"We can\"t do it ourselves. We can\"t lose any of the staff because they\"re needed to serve the retirees. What we need is competent, gullible idiots.\" Ryan\"s eyes widened as a thought hit him. \"We know exactly the right people.\"\n\n-\n\n\"Way to go Polly. Getting us in prison.\" Reid said. Olivia, Polly, Reid, and Jim were sitting around a small table. Frida was restrained to a wooden plank and a straitjacket behind them.\n\n\"They said that they had forgiven us. How would I know they changed their minds?\" Polly asked.\n\n\"Because if it involves you, the worst case scenario always happens. It\"s why I didn\"t want you opening the door,\" Olivia replied.\n\n\"What the-\" Polly stood up and put her hands on her hips. \"You told me to open the door.\"\n\n\"And look what happened. I think I broke a nail during the fight,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"I broke that guy\"s jaw,\" Frida smiled.\n\n\"We would\"ve won if someone hadn\"t given back a soldier their gun.\" Reid glared at Jim.\n\n\"What was I supposed to do? He asked me nicely,\" Jim said.\n\nCaptain Ryan chose that moment to enter the room. Frida squirmed and broke free of her restraints. She leapt to the captain with all the force her legs could generate. Lilly was excited by this conflict. Stepping in front of her captain, she pushed him to the ground and slapped Frida in the face midair. Frida collapsed on the ground and squirmed until she tripped her opponent. Lilly angled her fall to connect her fist directly with Frida\"s face. Frida retaliated by biting Lilly\"s knuckles. Guards rushed in to separate the two women.\n\n\"Let me go,\" Lilly smiled, \"I was winning.\"\n\n\"Release me from my restraints. Her fingers tasted good,\" Frida replied. Reid got out of his chair to help the captain up. When Ryan was standing, Reid pulled him close.\n\n\"I\"m not with her at all,\" Reid whispered, \"Hardly know her, please don\"t hold me accountable for her actions.\"\n\n\"Don\"t worry. Her initiative is exactly why I called you all in here. You have a talent for managing projects such as your resort,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"The resort was Polly\"s idea.\" Olivia held up an index finger. \"It was all her. I told her it was moronic, but she wouldn\"t listen,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Can you let him finish before accusing me?\" Polly asked.\n\n\"I think the resort was a great idea, but you all lacked resources.\"\n\n\"That\"s what I said.\" Reid wrapped his arm around Ryan\"s shoulders. Polly raised her hands in exasperation.\n\n\"I called you here to give you the tools and a task fitting of your skills which were demonstrated with my soldiers.\" Ryan glanced at Lilly.\n\n\"Wait a second, is this mission probably going to kill us all, and you called us here because you don\"t want to risk the lives of the people who mattered?\" Polly asked. Ryan blinked a few times before deciding that the has no idea how to lie properly.\n\n\"You got me. That is exactly why I brought you here.\"\n\n\"I\"m offended you would do that.\" Reid pushed him away. \"I have too much self-respect to be a sacrificial lamb in any form.\"\n\n\"You get to pilot a submersible,\" Ryan said. Everyone in the room held their breaths and stared at each other. Jim broke the silence first.\n\n\"That sounds fun,\" he said.\n\n\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The room's silence eventually broke, as the gravity of Ryan's words began to sink in. \"We're going to be in charge of piloting those relics?\" Olivia finally asked, her fingers tapping on the table.\n\n\"And if we die, then it's a tragic accident,\" Jim piped up, trying to keep the mood light despite the danger implied.\n\n\"In that spirit, we need to prepare,\" Reid said, his voice returning to business-like. \"We'll need to know everything there is to know about these submersibles. Starting with their history and design, all the way down to how to operate them. The more we know, the better our chances are of not only surviving but completing the mission.\"\n\n\"I'll get on the research,\" Reid offered, turning to Olivia and Polly. \"You two know anything about boats, right?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" Polly admitted. \"But I'm a quick learner. Besides, we've got the team for this.\"\n\n\"And I don't get why we're the only ones you think can do this,\" Jim said, looking at Ryan suspiciously. \"Why us?\"\n\n\"Because you don't have much to lose. You're not integral to the retirement community's daily life, and you have the right blend of curiosity, recklessness, and desperation to pull this off,\" Ryan explained.\n\nThe corners of Frida's mouth curled into a sneer. \"And you don't care about us because you're too busy with your precious retirement project,\" she spat. But despite her hostility, she couldn't help but feel a nugget of excitement at the thought of taking the controls of such an ancient vessel.\n\n\"Look, I don't enjoy this any more than you do, but this is the hand we've been dealt,\" Ryan replied. \"If you all don't step up, there will be a lot more than just retirement on the line.\"\n\nTheir expressions told him they understood. They exchanged glances, each knowing what the other was thinking. It wasn't just their lives that were on the line this time. Failure could mean something far worse than death.\n\n\"We'd better get started,\" Reid said, clapping his hands together. \"We've a lot to learn, and we don't have long—whenever they decide to check our progress.\"\n\nAs they stood up to leave, Lilly pulled Ryan aside. \"Just be careful,\" she said quietly. \"These old relics might have been built to withstand wars, but they can be unpredictable.\"\n\n\"I'm counting on you to keep an eye on things back here while I'm down there with them,\" he responded.\n\nLilly nodded, though her face betrayed her unease. The idea of sending them into danger was distasteful to her, but there was no denying the gravity of Ryan's request. She knew that, as much as she yearned for combat, this was not a battle she could be part of.\n\nIn the days that followed, the team burrowed into the submersibles' history, their specifications, and how to operate them. Reid delved into the technical details, while Polly and Olivia learned the basics of navigation. Jim, with no particular skills in this area, helped by providing morale and keeping everyone focused.\n\nAs Ryan had predicted, the retirees were thrilled with the idea of new activities. They flocked to the lake, eager to see the old submersibles in action. Little did they know the peril their amusement would soon put the team in.\n\n\"All right, Reid. Check the gauges and sensors. Polly, prepare to dive,\" Ryan said as they boarded the first submersible. The team had finally decided to test one of the vessels, their research complete.\n\n\"Roger that,\" Reid replied, quickly checking the controls and displays. \"Everything seems to be in order.\"\n\n\"Olivia, open her up,\" Ryan instructed, turning to the engine panel.\n\nOlivia gave a quick thumbs up as the submersible began to hum to life. The retirees cheered and waved as the submersible began to back into the water. \"She's running as smoothly as we could hope,\" Olivia reported.\n\n\"Then let's see how she handles underwater,\" Ryan said. \"Reid, take us down.\"\n\nWith a slow, controlled descent, the submersible plunged into the depths of the lake. The retirees watched with bated breath as the vessel disappeared beneath the surface.\n\nBelow, the team could see the walls of the lake illuminated by the submersible's lights. Ryan felt a mix of excitement and fear as they maneuvered the controls, testing every feature.\n\nAfter an hour passed, they began their ascent. As they drew closer to the surface, they could see the waiting crowd.\n\n\"Here we go, folks. We've got a live feed for you, so you can see what we're seeing,\" Ryan announced, as the video link engaged with the surface.\n\nIt was then that the unexpected happened. A sudden malfunction caused the submersible's controls to flicker wildly. The team struggled to regain control, but it was too late.\n\nWith a gut-wrenching lurch, the submersible began to spiral out of control, its descent accelerating. The team was thrown around the cramped interior as the submersible plummeted deeper into the lake.\n\nThe retirees watched in horror as the live feed showed the submersible careening towards the lake bed. As it smashed into the bottom, there was a deafening crunch, and the feed cut out.\n\nPanic ensued. The retirees scrambled for their radios, trying to reach the team. But it was too late. The submersible was lost, and so far as they could tell, so was the team.\n\nAbove, Ryan, Reid, Polly, and Olivia were disoriented in the dark, cold waters. They had blacked out from the impact, but they soon awoke to the horror of their situation. They were trapped, with no way back to the surface.\n\n\"Is everyone alright?\" Ryan said, his voice trembling with fear and fatigue.\n\n\"Yeah, but I don't think we can go much further,\" Reid replied, checking the gauges. \"We're running low on oxygen.\"\n\nOlivia shivered, her teeth chattering. \"We need to get out of here.\"\n\n\"We have to find a way back to the surface,\" Polly said. \"Come on. We can't just sit here and wait for death.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Jim said, looking at the controls again. \"I think I can get us back.\"\n\n\"Do it,\" Ryan said. \"We don't have much time.\"\n\nWith a burst of determination, Jim took control of the submersible. Slowly, he managed to stabilize its descent and began to rise back to the surface. It was a laborious process, fraught with fear and uncertainty, but they were determined to make it.\n\nFinally, as the submersible broke the surface, the team sighed with relief. They were alive, but they knew that their ordeal was far from over. They had barely escaped death, and they knew that there were more dangers lurking just beneath the surface of the lake.\n\nAs the retirees watched the submersible return to the surface, they realized that what they had witnessed was far from a simple joyride. The team had narrowly escaped death, and they knew that it was only the beginning of their ordeal. They watched as the team emerged from the submersible, exhausted and shaken, but they were alive.\n\nThe retirees cheered as the team returned, but they knew that they had a lot to think about. They had seen the danger that lurked beneath the surface of the lake, and they knew that they couldn't take any more risks.\n\nThe team, too, knew that they had a lot to think about. They had narrowly escaped death, and they knew that they couldn't let it happen again. They had seen the danger that lurked beneath the surface of the lake, and they knew that they had to be more careful in the future.\n\nThe retirees and the team knew that they had narrowly escaped death, and they knew that they couldn't let it happen again. They had seen the danger that lurked beneath the surface of the lake, and they knew that they had to be more careful in the future. They knew that they had to work together to overcome the dangers that lay ahead, and they knew that they had to be prepared for anything.\n\nAnd so, the retirees and the team prepared for the next phase of their journey.

My teacher, Miss Lawrence, was looking at me with slight exasperation. Her red locks bobbed slightly as she shook her head left to right, sighing slightly she continued the lecture, talking about old engineering feats, underground tunnels and the sort. I heard a few snickers around me from my class-mates. It\"s easy to take sleep for granted when you get plenty of it, a fact I\"ve become very aware of the last two weeks.\n\n-.. I want those assignments on my desk by Monday\n\nShe said\n\n-And make sure you all get enough rest\n\nShe finished, with a pointed look at me. I took it in stride, it\"s not like it\"s my fault I hardly get any sleep..\n\n-Hey, Simon!\n\nFred, school boxing star and all around good-guy, yelled behind me as I was getting my bag out of my locker.\n\n-You gotta stop dozing off like that, you\"re gonna get shit if it keeps up\n\n-Yeah, yeah, I know..\n\n-What\"s up, anyways? You got a new girl you haven\"t told me about, keeping you up at night?\n\nHe asked with a coy smile. I gave him a sly grin\n\n-Nah man, that sounds like a good problem to have..\n\nI scratched my neck and looked down at my feet\n\n-It\"s a bit embarrassing actually..\n\nHe looked looked slightly concerned\n\n-What is? You know you can tell me anything, still haven\"t told a soul about the-\n\nHe scanned the surroundings quickly, making sure no one was in earshot\n\n-\"undearwear incident\" in second grade\n\nHe loved to bring up that example whenever he wanted to prove his reliability, which is unnecessary since it has never been in question during all the years I\"ve known him.\n\n-It\"s night terrors\n\nI said\n\n-But it\"s more than that. I think they\"re over, but then they\"re not.. I wake from a nightmare, drenched in sweat, heart racing, trying to calm myself down. Memories of the dream fading, and I see shadows out of the corner of my eye, moving away from me. I try and focus on them, and they fade into the background.\n\nFred looks quizzical for a moment, then he asks\n\n-Is it like sleep paralysis? I\"ve never had it, but I\"ve heard some really freaky stories..\n\n-Nah, it\"s not that. I\"ve had them a lot as a kid, you probably heard most of those stories from me.. No, this is different. I can move while its going on, and I don\"t feel the dread I\"ve come to associated with sleep paralysis. It\"s freaky still, but in another way. I feel hollow whenever I wake up, like I\"m missing something. It lasts all the way up to around lunch.\n\nEven in the light of day, the topic was getting on my nerves. Fred seemed to sense I was uncomfortable with digging too deep into this at the moment\n\n-Sounds rough\n\nHe said\n\n-Nothing a bit of practice won\"t solve. See you there?\n\nHe asked, slapping my arm\n\n-You bet\n\nI slapped his arm back\n\nA few hours, and several bruises later, I was sitting out in my garden on the green grass, birds chirping in the background, late spring wind fanning my face and hair.\n\n-Watcha\" doing?\n\nMy annoying sister, Sarah, chirped up.\n\n-Meditating. Same as yesterday. And the day before that.\n\nShe loved to find new ways to annoy me, currently it was asking questions she already knew the answer to, but that in itself isn\"t good enough. She needs to know I know she knows the answer.\n\n-Watcha\" doing that for?\n\n-To get away from you, scram!\n\nI snapped at her, giving her an evil look.\n\nShe scrambled away, giggling all the way.\n\nMeditation, I\"d started doing it a while ago, when I was still fantasizing about the idea of becoming a pro-boxer, looking for any edge I could eek out in order to compete with Fred. It was supposed to increase focus in the ring. I bet it does wonders, but I gave up on it on too soon to figure. Now, now I\"m doing it out of desperation. Maybe my night terrors were because of a worried mind? Meditation calms the mind, so maybe it\"ll cure this problem?\n\nI felt a buzz in my pocket, it\"s a text from Alyssa in the group chat\n\n-You guys ready?\n\nShe asked\n\n-Shit is it now?!?\n\nFred responded\n\n-I\"ll bring snacks\n\nHenri chimed in, always prepared for pretty much any situation, no matter how unlikely\n\n-Yeah, usual spot in 15?\n\nI typed\n\nAlyssa, one year older than the rest of us, senior in highschool, had a bit of an obsession with the occult. Well, obsession is a bit harsh, but she\"s fascinated by it, reading up on stuff, buying tarot cards, crystals and herbs used in different rituals. She found some fortune-teller/medium on craigslist, and she badgered the rest of us to join her on her expedition there.\n\nApproximately 15 minutes later I approached the diner/convince store named Shop\"N\"Stop, Fred and Henri already waiting by the rundown, faded exterior of the place who couldn\"t make its mind up about what it was. The shop is alright, got the necessities at a reasonable price, the diner on the other hand.. only one I know who haven\"t been running to the toilet for a week after eating there is Alyssa, and it\"s hardly fair to count her since she\"s some kind of freak of nature when it comes to dodging sickness, and most bad things now that I think about it.\n\n-Where\"s our heroine, dragging us out at this ungodly hour to do God knows what, with forces and powers beyond our comprehension to witness, let alone understand?\n\nI waxed poetically at the two in greeting. Henri chuckles and adjusts his glasses, while Fred smiles and looks behind me\n\n-T\"was three hours before midnight, sun\"s last rays still sparkling. Hardly an ungodly hour\n\nA playful voice behind me, coming closer, said. I turn around and see her, auburn hair playing lightly in the slight wind, eyes glimmering a greyish green in the afromentioned sun, set over the barely visible freckles dotting her nose and visible cheekbones.\n\nYeah, she\"s a real looker, and I\"m well aware of that. She\"s the standard I judge other beauties by, and it\"s anything but a fair standard. My feelings towards her is more like that of a sister, only she\"s less annoying, knowing someone since kindergarten kinda does that. There\"s days I\"ve wondered, even fantasized about the two of us, once her blooming beauty was becoming apparent even to me. But I\"d make it weird if I made a move, and she sees me as a brother as well, she\"s said it in the past..\n\n-Considering our mission this evening, anything after noon is an ungodly hour\n\nHenri, the only staunch atheist and unbeliever in anything paranormal, intoned. Despite his scepticism, he\"s the most easily scared of the bunch.\n\n-Wouldn\"t be you if you weren\"t the last one here\n\nI smiled at Alyssa\n\nFred came up to us and put his arms around our shoulders\n\n-Alright birdies, let\"s get a move on. I\"ve got a pizza with my name on it at home. It\"s very impatient, can\"t wait to see the insides of my stomach\n\nWe got a move on, going towards the older parts of town, the Shop\"N\"Stop marking the end of the newer, better maintained parts of town.\n\nHenri glanced around nervously\n\n-So where\"d you say you found this guy? Or woman? Or whatever?\n\nHe asked\n\n-Woman\n\nAlyssa responded, giving him a quick smile\n\n-Found her on craigslist, she\"s a bit expensive but I think it\"s worth it. I\"ve only tried cheap mediums so far, and the price really reflected the quality of their work\n\nShe huffed, looking slightly annoyed, then she turned to the group and beamed towards us\n\n-Good thing I got you guys to share the fee with\n\nHenri huffed incredulously\n\n-You mean you got us to badger until we finally agree to do what you want?\n\nFred looked to Henri\n\n-Hey, you let her talk you into this, no use complaining about it now\n\nHe said, not able to completely hide the slight tone of defeat in his own voice.\n\n-I\"m actually looking forward to this\n\nI interjected\n\n-Not that I believe this is anything but a scam, but I\"d say it\"s worth 25 bucks for one evenings worth of entertainment, I\"m curious to figure out what kind of tricks she\"ll use to try and trick us..\n\n-Alright guys, that\"s enough\n\nAlyssa said, looking at us, brow slightly furrowed\n\n-I want to do this with you, but if you\"re going to crap all over it before you\"ve even tried it you\"re just gonna ruin it, for me, for you, for everyone. Just have an open mind\n\nShe looked at us pleadingly\n\n-Alright\n\nI looked at her\n\n-The final reason I think this\"ll be worth $50 of my own money, is that on the off chance that this is real, I\"d pay that sum several times over\n\nAlyssa\"s entire being lit up as she smiled at me\n\n-That\"s the spirit, we\"re almost there\n\n-Simon\n\n-zzt..fffzzZzz -static-\n\n-SIMON\n\nThe scream echoed in my ears. My balance is off, the world is shaking. Fred is shaking me, looking me in the eyes.\n\n-Where\"d you go buddy?\n\nHe asked, looking me in the eyes intensely. I looked to Alyssa, worry written all over her face, rarely seen wrinkles making an appearance on her face, Henri alternating glances at me and the ground, fidgeting with something in his hands.\n\n-I.. I don\"t... There was something.. over there.\n\nI said, pointing towards the side of an old, dilapidated house, overgrown weeds all over the lawn and house itself. The dizziness was starting to pass\n\n-There was a shadow. Something moved, I got all dizzy.. It\"s gone now.\n\nFred looked really worried now\n\n-Shadow?\n\nHe asked\n\n-It\"s fine, just the sleep deprivation doing a number on me, I can handle it\n\n-We can do this another time, if you need to go home and rest\n\nAlyssa chimed in, worry still apparent on her face, she\"d been looking forward to this for over a week, she\"d always put her friends wellbeing above her own interest, I didn\"t want to let her down\n\n-It\"s fine, I\"m feeling much better already\n\n-Here, take this\n\nHenri reached out a hand with a piece of candy, meant to raise the blood sugar of those with diabetes, I bit down on it and smiled towards the group\n\n-Good as new, let\"s do this\n\nThey looked unconvinced, but agreed\n\n-This is it\n\nAlyssa said, looking at the very same dilapidated house\n\n-Only one thing left to do then\n\nI said with much more bravado than I felt, a sense of dread growing in me as I marched up towards the overgrown house...\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "I glanced back at my friends, who all seemed to have been momentarily petrified by the sight of the house. It was a stark contrast to the cheerful, almost naive optimism that clung to our group throughout our teenage years. The dilapidated building seemed to loom like a grim guardian over what was once a thriving neighborhood, now fallen into disrepair and abandonment. \n\nAlyssa led the way, her confidence and curiosity barely shaken despite the eerie silence enveloping us. We followed her, each step onto the lawn making a sickening squelch in the damp spring grass. The house creaked ominously, as if the very structure itself was tired and unwilling to bear our presence. \n\nAs we approached the front door, which was hanging askew on one rusty hinge, I noticed a peculiar symbol etched into the door frame. It was jagged and almost otherworldly, a stark juxtaposition to the normality we were used to. I squinted and tried to make sense of the strange glyph, but it only seemed to dance away from my grasp, mocking my inability to decipher its meaning.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" I whispered to Fred, pointing at the symbol.\n\nHe nodded, his eyes glinting with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. \"It's... unsettling.\"\n\nAlyssa knocked on the door, the sound echoing eerily in the silent house. There was no response, but a subtle creak indicated that something – or someone – might be inside. With bated breath, she pushed the door open, revealing a dark and musty interior. \n\nAs we stepped over the threshold, I could feel a cold shiver run down my spine. The air inside the house felt thick, heavy, as if it carried the weight of years of neglect and untold stories. Dust motes danced in the slivers of light that managed to filter through the grime-covered windows.\n\n\"Hello?\" Alyssa called out, her voice echoing in the empty space. There was no answer, but the silence seemed almost alive, as if it was holding its breath in anticipation of something.\n\nI felt a nudge from Fred, who gestured towards a corner of the room. There, a small, ornate table stood – the kind that usually held a vase or a family photograph in more habitable homes. But this table was different. It was adorned with various strange objects: a tarot deck, an intricately carved crystal, and several candles arranged in a complex pattern.\n\n\"That's where we need to be,\" Alyssa said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"The medium said she would meet us there.\"\n\nWe all exchanged nervous glances before moving towards the table. As I sat down, I noticed that the symbols etched into the doorframe were mirrored on the underside of the table. It was as if the house itself was communicating something, though I had no idea what.\n\nAlyssa began to arrange the objects on the table, her hands moving with an almost practiced grace. \"She said we needed to create a circle of protection. Once that's done, she'll be able to communicate with us.\"\n\nHenri, who had been remarkably silent throughout this ordeal, finally spoke up. \"And how exactly does that work? Are we supposed to believe she's actually talking to spirits or something?\"\n\nAlyssa shot him a look that was both exasperated and weary. \"I don't know, Henri. But I trust her. And I think we should at least give it a chance.\"\n\nAs she finished arranging the objects, a soft knock echoed through the house. We all jumped, startled, as the front door creaked open once more. In stepped the medium we had been waiting for – an elderly woman with sharp, calculating eyes and an aura of calm about her.\n\n\"Good evening, children,\" she greeted us, her voice steady and serene. \"I'm glad you've all come. There's much to discuss.\"\n\nThe medium began to speak of things that were beyond our understanding – of spirit worlds, of energy and vibrations, and of the thin veil that separates our world from others. As she spoke, a strange sensation began to wash over me. It was as if something inside me was stirring, something that had been dormant for a long time.\n\nSuddenly, without warning, the room began to shake violently. The candles on the table flickered wildly, and the air grew thicker, more oppressive. We all exchanged fearful glances as the medium continued her incantations, her voice rising to a fever pitch.\n\n\"By the powers of the elements, by the grace of the ancients, I call upon you to show us the truth,\" she intoned.\n\nJust as the room seemed on the verge of imploding, a sudden calm descended. The candles stopped flickering, and the air grew still. In the silence that followed, we could hear a soft, ethereal whisper.\n\n\"Help me..\"\n\nThe voice was faint, almost imperceptible, but it was unmistakable. I glanced at my friends, and saw the same mixture of shock and wonder in their eyes. The medium, however, seemed unsurprised.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice calm and soothing.\n\nThe whisper grew a little louder, more insistent. \"Help me.. I'm trapped..\"\n\nA shiver ran down my spine as the medium began to speak again, her voice filled with authority. \"We are here to help you. But you must show us the way.\"\n\nThe whisper grew louder still, until it filled the entire room. \"Follow the light..\"\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it had begun, the voice faded away, leaving behind an uneasy silence. The medium closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and opened them again.\n\n\"It's time for us to leave,\" she said, her voice firm but calm. \"There are things here that are not meant to be disturbed.\"\n\nWe all stood up, feeling a sense of relief mixed with unease. As we made our way out of the house, I glanced back at the table, and saw that the symbols were glowing faintly, pulsing with an otherworldly light. It was as if the house itself was bidding us farewell.\n\nAs we walked back to our cars, I felt a profound sense of something unknown. The night terrors that had plagued me for weeks seemed, for a moment, to have lost their grip on me. But the sense of unease remained, a reminder that there were things in this world that we could not control, and perhaps should not try to understand.\n\nAs we drove away from the dilapidated house, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets it held, what other mysteries lay hidden within its walls. But for now, I was content to leave it be, and focus on the present – and the future, which, for once, felt just a little bit brighter.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_014", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Once upon a time there was a young boy who had nothing. Truthfully, he had less than nothing. He lived in a small town full of werewolves, witches, and ghosts galore, but he was human, one of the Forsaken. To make matters worse, he was an orphan.\n\n\nOne particularly bad day, he had an idea. On the outskirts of town lived the vampires. And vampires take care of their own. They don't steal food or clothes like desperate orphans do. No, they keep each other well fed and comfortable. And the boy yearned for that.\n\nSo, later that night, when all the other orphans were asleep, he crept out of the orphanage and turned towards the hills outside of town. He knew in his gut that this would be his last night alone.\n\n• • •\n\nOnce upon a time a vampire ruled atop a lonely throne. She was respected by many, but loved by few, and of those few she trusted even less. She knew the truth, you see. She knew that vampires are not kind, nor are they loyal. It's true that they guard each other from the outside, but they will turn on one another in a heartbeat. So she ruled with an iron fist, fearing that if she loosened her grip, she would lose everything.\n\nThis made certain aspects of her unlife hard. After all, she might not care that the blood tribute was a pint short, but if she didn't bring retribution, the others would challenge her power. And when less benign rulers came into power, more than a few pints of blood ran in the streets. Her strict rules made things hard for her at times. The day she discovered a Forsaken in her home was one of those times.\n\n• • •\n\nCelia strode down a hall lit by dim torches. Despite their flames, the hall leading down into the dungeon was cold. Fitting for a place of sorrow and despair. Even though it stayed empty in recent times, the last tenant of the manor used the dank basement liberally, and she suspected that angry ghosts remained nearby. She was only going there now because of a summons from her most loyal servant and friend, Johnny, who supposedly discovered a Forsaken One trying to break in.\n\nShe wiped auburn hair from her face and straightened her black dress, then went around a corner into a side room where Johnny was waiting for her. The old man was wiry, and wore a suit that at one time would have been very nice, but time had not been kind to him or the suit.\n\n\"Ah, Miss Celia, thank you for coming. Here is the Forsaken One that I caught sneaking into the courtyard. He claims he's here to see you.\"\n\nCelia looked at the small, skinny boy, tied to a chair. His mouth was pressed into a thin line and his eyes looked nearly feral.\n\nCelia knelt down so she was eye level with the boy. \"Untie him. This is no way to treat a guest.\"\n\n\"But, Miss, we still don't know why he was sneaking in, and -\"\n\n\"He is a child, Johnny. Don't make me ask again.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"Let's cut to the chase, why are you here?\" asked Celia.\n\nThe boy looked into her blood red eyes for a moment, then fearfully looked away. \"I w-want to be-become a vampire.\"\n\nCelia was taken aback. Sure, some people wanted the life of a vampire, but they were few and far between. None of them had ever been so young.\n\n\"Tell me, boy, how old are you?\"\n\nThe boy looked puzzled. \"Thirteen. Why?\"\n\n\"A thirteen year old boy breaks into my home and says he wants to be a vampire. That's a first. It's also a good way to get yourself killed. Be glad that Johnny found you. A lesser vampire would have drained you there and then.\"\n\nThe boy gulped. \"Well, will you make me a vampire?\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Johnny. \"Vampirism isn't a jacket you can take on and off whenever you feel like it! It's a curse that you have to live with forever. To turn you at thirteen years old would be cruel! You should have more sense than to ask for this.\"\n\nCelia examined the boy closer. His clothes were raggedy and patched. Bruises covered just about every surface of his body. As soon as Johnny rose his voice, the boy winced.\n\nCelia lowered her voice to just above a whisper. \"Tell me, why do you want to be a vampire?\"\n\nThe boy rubbed his wrists. \"I thought if I became a vampire you might take care of me, then I wouldn't have to go back to the orphanage.\"\n\n\"Why don't you tell me about the orphanage,\" prompted Celia.\n\n\"I don't like it there. Helga is mean to us. She doesn't give us much food, and then the other kids steal mine because they're hungry too. She makes us work all day, and if we don't do enough, she makes us sleep in the floor.\"\n\n\"Do you have a name, boy?\" asked Johnny.\n\nThe boy nodded. \"My name is Cur. Or at least, that's what people call me. Helga says that's my name because no one would ever want me.\"\n\nShe felt for the boy, but years of hardening herself kept any emotions from showing through. \"Let me tell you a story, Cur. A long time ago, a young girl lived happily with her family. They lived in fear because they were Forsaken, but she didn't understand that. She was happy.\n\n\"One day, a visitor came. What she didn't know was that every month her parents paid a 'protection tax' to the vampire lord. They didn't pay in time, so he came to visit. The little girl, hiding in a closet, heard the sounds of her parents dying. Then he found her.\n\n\"He told her that her family broke the rules, and that meant they had to pay the price, even her. She had two options. Become a servant in his house, or die.\"\n\nCur was shaking now, and spoke with barely a whisper. \"What did she choose?\"\n\nCelia leaned in close. \"I chose to live.\"\n\nShe backed away, then drew a dagger that was hidden away in her clothes. She held it to Cur's throat, and a small trickle of blood came out.\n\n\"You broke the rules, Cur, and everyone must pay the price. Even orphans. So I'll give you the same choice that was given to me. Stay here, in my house, and be my servant, or I'll give you a swift death. It's up to you.\"\n\nIt was the only option. She couldn't let him go, or she would look weak, and weak vampires don't survive. But she knew by the fire in his eyes that this boy would never choose death.\n\nCur looked at the blood pooling on the gleaming blade. \"If I stay here, you won't send me back to the orphanage, right?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay. I'll do whatever you want, whenever you want. I swear I'll make you proud.\"\n\nCelia withdrew the blade. She wiped the blade clean, then stowed it away. Then she turned away, but stopped at the door.\n\n\"Johnny, show him to the servant's quarters and get him something to eat. Oh, and Cur, you need to know something.\"\n\nCur mindlessly held the cut on his neck, but looked up to Celia expectantly.\n\n\"A cur tends to be unwanted, but they are stronger because of it. And they don't hesitate to lash out at anything causing them pain. Make your name a strength, and no one can use it against you.\"\n\n• • •\n\nOnce upon a time there was a wicked woman who ran an orphanage. She was cruel and heartless, and all the kids feared her. One night, a little fiend of a child ran away, but she didn't care about him. She was just angry that one of her little workers had disappeared.\n\nThat night, the child rested easy. He had a bed all to himself, and a hot meal made it even better. And while he was dreaming, the wicked woman had an unexpected visitor.\n\nNo one knows exactly what happened to her that night. Some say she was paid well to leave town. Others say she had a secret lover and the two of them eloped. But the people on the edge of town have a different theory. For they heard the screams that night, and they found what was left the next morning. But the exact story matters not, for the wicked woman was never seen again.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Sunlight streamed through the windows of his new quarters, a stark contrast to the dark corners of the orphanage, where he had slept as if he were in a cave. The new sensations around him were overwhelming, not just the light, but also the absence of Helga's harsh voice and the other orphans' hungry eyes.\n\nJohnny, who had been quietly tending to him last night, came to check on him. He was a stern man, with eyes as cold as Celia's, yet there was a warmth beneath it, a caring that he had kept hidden behind his gruff exterior. He handed Cur a bowl of thick, dark blood, which Cur drank reluctantly.\n\n\"Get used to it, boy,\" Johnny said, his voice less harsh than usual. \"Blood is your new sustenance. And you'll need it to grow strong.\"\n\nCur glanced away, the taste of blood still fresh in his mouth. \"Why does it taste like iron?\"\n\nJohnny chuckled, the sound unexpected yet comforting. \"It's not iron, boy, but it will strengthen you. Just like meat does for mortals. Eat it, drink it, become familiar with it.\"\n\nCur nodded, and sipped the blood, forcing himself to get used to it. He knew he was on a new path, one that he had chosen, and now he was determined to make the best of it. Johnny left him to his breakfast, giving him space to adjust to his new life.\n\nIn the days that followed, Cur learned the ways of the manor and its inhabitants. He was shown how to clean, cook, and tend to the gardens, tasks he had done at the orphanage but were now part of a larger whole. He found that the work did not tire him as it used to, for his strength had doubled overnight. The boy who had always been hungry now had food in abundance, but he found that his appetite for it lessened with each passing day.\n\nCelia watched him from afar, noting the changes in his demeanor. He was becoming less feral, less afraid, and more confident. Her heart softened towards him, despite her best efforts to keep it guarded. She had made a choice by allowing him into her world, and now she wondered if she had made the right one. But Cur was proving to be more resilient than she expected, and for that, she found herself admiring him.\n\nOne night, as Cur washed the dishes after supper, Celia approached him. \"You're doing well, Cur.\"\n\nHe looked up, surprised to hear her voice. \"Thank you, Miss Celia. I try my best.\"\n\nShe smiled, a rare sight that Cur had not seen before. \"In a few weeks, you will be stronger, and I will tell you more about my world. But for now, focus on learning the ways of the manor.\"\n\nCur nodded, knowing that this was just the beginning of his journey. He understood that the world was vast, with many secrets yet to be uncovered. And he was determined to learn all that he could.\n\nAs the weeks turned into months, Cur grew stronger, both physically and mentally. He learned about vampires and their history, about their beliefs and traditions. He became one of Celia's trusted servants, and for the first time in his life, he felt a sense of belonging.\n\nBut Cur also knew that his path was not yet complete. He still had much to learn, and his true test was yet to come. For he had a secret, one that he kept close to his heart, a secret that only he knew. He was determined to one day stand beside Celia, not just as her servant, but as her equal.\n\nAnd as he looked out at the moonlit night, Cur knew that he would stop at nothing to achieve his goal. He had once been the unwanted, the forgotten, but now he was on a path to greatness. He would make his name a strength, just as Celia had told him.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, he would find love and acceptance, not just from Celia, but from himself. For he knew that a true cur, a true survivor, never hesitates to lash out at anything causing them pain. And he was determined to make his name a legacy that would be remembered for generations to come.\n\nAnd so, once upon a time, in a world where the Forsaken lived among werewolves, witches, and ghosts, a boy named Cur found his place, and in doing so, he found himself.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_015", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Jogon sat alone in his dimly lit office, immersed in the gentle hum of his data console and the incandescent glow of holographic projections. Images and reports of a peculiar species, known to the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations as Homo Sapiens, flickered across the room. They had officially been a part of the galactic community for barely fifty cycles.\n\n\nJogon, recently assigned to their sector, had spent the equivalent of several human years studying them - observing their behavior, assessing their cultural and technological advancements, and - more often than not - grappling with their irrationalities. He marveled at the complexity and sheer audacity of this species, his mandibles chittering in consternation as he mulled over their latest reports.\n\nThe Orthonex was currently on the brink of a dire war with the Vorlaxath Hive, a terrifying swarm-like species known for its relentless and insatiable hunger for planetary resources. The Hive was encroaching upon the peaceful territories of the Orthonex, and it was time to call upon all member species to contribute to the defense of the federation.\n\nHowever, Jogon was about to make a highly controversial recommendation. Staring at his console, he tapped his segmented fingers on the metallic surface, shaping his argument carefully. He was of the belief, one he was about to share with the federation\"s military committee, that the humans should not be invited to partake in this war.\n\n\"This is a species,\" he began, recording his statement, \"that\"s wild and reckless beyond any precedent we\"ve previously encountered.\" He selected a video clip from his database and broadcast it for his audience to see. The clip showed humans \"space skiing,\" an activity where an individual, wearing nothing but a thin suit, was tethered to a spaceship and then dragged through open space at alarming speeds.\n\nJogon continued, \"This reckless act of thrill-seeking, an activity that endangers their lives for mere entertainment, is only one example of their unhinged behavior. Their tendencies for warfare are similar. They are unpredictable, their actions often driven by passion and impulse rather than logic and strategy.\"\n\nHe paused, pondering over his next words, \"Their unpredictable nature is a risk we cannot afford to take. If we are to prevail against the Vorlaxath Hive, we need allies we can depend on, not wild cards that could just as easily implode our plans as help execute them.\"\n\nClosing his arguments, Jogon sent off his recommendation to the committee. He was confident his points were valid, but he was also aware of the Orthonex\"s egalitarian principle - every civilization must get a chance to defend the federation. Whether the committee agreed with him or not, one thing was certain - dealing with humans was like playing a game of Xuridian roulette, a game Jogon wasn\"t sure they could afford to play.\n\nThe Overseers, the ruling council of the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations, convened in their grand hall, a testament to the cooperation and technological prowess of countless star systems. Each Overseer, an emissary of their species, sat encased in individual chambers adapted to their unique biological needs. All attention was on the holographic representation of Jogon, his image flickering amidst them, his report a topic of heated discussion.\n\nCouncillor Dremik, a towering silicon-based entity from the rocky world of Qarn, projected a resonating rumble, the universal translator articulating his thoughts. \"The humans... they exhibit a peculiar inclination towards danger... almost embracing it. Can we trust them in such a critical situation?\"\n\nContrasting this, Pallaxia, a cloud-like sentience from the nebulous realm of Ethereal Mists, offered a differing viewpoint. \"Their fearlessness may be a valuable asset against the Vorlaxath Hive. Do we not value courage in the face of danger? Moreover, our laws are clear; we cannot deny them the opportunity to defend their place in the Orthonex.\"\n\n\"Their war technology is not to be overlooked,\" murmured Vesto, a telepathic mollusk-like creature from the ocean world of Tydalus, his thoughts pulsating through the council members. \"The humans seem particularly adept at it.\"\n\nThe debate raged on, with points made in favor and against the involvement of humans. Ultimately, Jogon\"s cautionary tales of human recklessness fell on respectful but unwavering minds. In the spirit of equality and a fair chance, the council decided to extend the call-to-arms to humanity.\n\nAn official communique was drafted, a formal request outlining the dire situation and pleading for any military assistance the humans could provide against the Vorlaxath Hive. The document was heavily reviewed, ensuring it was appropriately translated and devoid of any potential miscommunication.\n\nAs the communique was dispatched to the humans, Jogon, despite his initial reservations, felt a strange curiosity. Humans were wildly unpredictable, and if their historical data was any indicator, their response to the call-to-arms would be anything but conventional. Even as the council adjourned, one sentiment echoed through the hall: Only time would tell whether they had made a strategic ally or invited further chaos into their well-structured universe.\n\nA solar cycle passed before a response was received from the humans. The Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations, with its various species nervously watching, readied its armada against the approaching Vorlaxath Hive. News of the human response reached Jogon\"s desk, a mere line of text that belied the monumental nature of its message. The humans had dispatched a single ship in response to the call-to-arms. A single ship? Jogon felt his mandibles tense as he considered the implications.\n\nAs the overseers gathered once more to discuss this development, the massive view screen at the council chamber\"s front displayed the human ship in question. Compared to the sprawling, intricate structures of the Orthonex fleet, the human vessel looked like a tiny speck of metallic dust. There was an air of incredulity amongst the council. Pallaxia was the first to break the silence, \"Have the humans misunderstood our request?\"\n\nVesto, on the other hand, was more thoughtful. \"We should not underestimate them. Their technology advances at an unprecedented rate. They might surprise us yet.\"\n\nA collective sense of anticipation filled the room as the human vessel made its appearance at the meeting coordinates. But something was off. I took a moment before anyone had even noticed their arrival and according to the calculations, the humans should have taken a couple more days to reach the location given their FTL technology. The Overseers exchanged puzzled glances. How did they get here so quickly and without anyone noticing?\n\nOne of the senior federation officers, Gavroche, from the highly advanced civilization of Luminary and debatably the most advanced civilization in FTL travel, expressed his disbelief, \"It\"s almost as if they...teleported. But that\"s impossible.\" The humans were known to push the limits of technology, but instantaneous space travel was a frontier not even the most advanced civilizations in the Orthonex had crossed.\n\nAs the overseers grappled with this mystery, a communication request came through from the human ship. The council fell silent as the message was broadcasted. \"We apologize for the delay,\" a human voice echoed in the council chamber, their tone surprisingly casual, \"According to the rules we\"re still customizing ourselves to, our presence is required on the battlefield. Otherwise, we would have just teleported the bomb.\"\n\nJogon felt his multi-faceted eyes widen, his antennae twitching anxiously. \"Teleported the...bomb?\" The council echoed, confusion and dread filling the room as the full implications of the human\"s words hung in the air, a harbinger of a storm yet to come. In the following moments, time seemed to stretch and dilate, as though the universe itself was holding its breath.\n\nThe silence in the grand hall of the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations was so profound that one could almost hear the pulsations of the distant stars.\"Yes,\" the human voice broke the silence once more, its tone starkly contrasting with the tension that had encapsulated the hall. \"Our antimatter singularity bomb.\"Before the stunned council members could react, a blinding light blossomed on the massive viewscreen.\n\nAs they shielded their visual sensors from the radiant explosion, every conversation, every thought was dwarfed by the spectacle unfolding before them. The display struggled to compensate for the intense light before finally settling down to show the aftermath. And then, as the light receded, there was... nothing.\n\nJust the emptiness of space where once a horde of Vorlaxath Hive ships had swarmed. In what seemed to be an instant, the dire threat to the Orthonex was obliterated, reduced to cosmic dust.The human ship was also gone, leaving no trace behind. No heat signature, no warp trail, just a void where it had once hovered. \"Did they... Did they teleport away?\" murmured a stunned Gavroche, disbelief audible in his voice.\n\n\"There was no engine engagement, no displacement. It\"s as though they just... vanished.\"The council was left staring at the emptiness of space, their thoughts echoing Gavroche\"s disbelief. The magnitude of what the humans had just demonstrated was difficult to grasp. They had not only displayed the capability to annihilate a vast fleet with a single bomb but also hinted at a form of travel that seemed to defy the known laws of physics.\n\nJogon felt a chill running down his exoskeleton, his antennae twitching in the charged atmosphere of the council chamber. His earlier reports about human recklessness and unpredictability suddenly seemed like a grave understatement.As shockwaves of realization swept through the Conglomeration, one question resonated across the galactic federation, a question that carried with it an undercurrent of fear and awe, \"What exactly have we welcomed into our galactic community?\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The council room buzzed with speculation and debate as the realization of the humans' capabilities spread. The bomb, with a raw power reminiscent of ancient mythological tales of cosmic destruction, had not only erased the Hive but had also put on display a level of technology that surpassed what the Orthonex had ever imagined. Questions about the human's understanding of such power, and their willingness to wield it, began to swirl among the council members.\n\nCouncillor Dremik, still resonating with the echoes of the shockwave, broke the silence, \"The humans... their bomb, it was not just any weapon. It was a declaration of power, a testament to their technological prowess, and a stark reminder of what we might have underestimated.\"\n\nJogon, his mandibles chittering more violently than ever, agreed, \"They are indeed unpredictable, but they are also profoundly formidable. Their ability to teleport, to disappear and reappear at will, defies the principles we uphold. The humans have shown us a glimpse of what they are capable of, and I fear we are not yet ready to comprehend the full extent of their potential.\"\n\nThe council, awestruck by the revelation, convened in serious contemplation. Pallaxia, always the voice of reason in moments of crisis, said, \"We must adapt to this new reality. The humans have proven themselves invaluable allies, yet we must tread cautiously. Their unpredictable nature may be a wild card, but it is a wild card with the strength to turn the tide of any battle.\"\n\nFor the first time, the council began to draft new strategies, ones that took the humans into account. Training programs were initiated, designed to understand and work alongside humans, to learn their methods and to create a shared defense against any future threats. It was a monumental shift; the Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations was no longer just a federation of equals, but a federation that embraced the diversity of its member species, recognizing that in their differences lay their greatest strength.\n\nIn the days that followed, the humans were hailed as heroes across the Orthonex, their name now synonymous with power and protection. And yet, Jogon could not shake the feeling of a creeping unease. The humans had shown they were powerful and willing to use that power, but they were also unpredictable, driven by passion and impulse rather than logic and strategy. He worried that their unpredictable nature could be their downfall as much as their greatest asset.\n\nDespite his reservations, Jogon couldn't deny that the humans had changed the course of the galaxy. They had shown that even the most irrational species could be the key to survival in the vast expanse of space. As he gazed out into the star-studded cosmos, he realized that the universe was full of mysteries, full of species beyond their understanding, and full of potential for both destruction and salvation.\n\nAs the Orthonex moved forward, building coalitions and preparing for the future, Jogon knew that they could not afford to ignore the humans any longer. They were a part of the galactic community, a wild card in their midst, but a wild card that could very well be the key to their continued existence. Whether this new alliance would lead to greater harmony or unforeseen chaos, only time could tell. But as Jogon sat in his office, surrounded by the hum of his data consoles and the glow of holographic projections, he was certain of one thing: The humans had changed the game, and the Orthonex would have to adapt to survive.\n\nIn the end, the humans' unpredictable nature would either be their greatest strength or their gravest weakness. The Conglomeration of Orthonex Civilizations would have to find a way to navigate this fine line, to understand and harness the power of this enigmatic new ally, and to ensure that their shared future was one of peace, prosperity, and unity. The universe, with its endless expanse and its myriad civilizations, was a complex and often dangerous place, but it was also full of possibility. And as Jogon looked out into the darkness, he felt a strange sense of hope, a hope that in their diversity and in their differences, they could build something truly magnificent, something that would endure long after they had all vanished into the vastness of time and space.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains a consistent narrative coherence with the preceding text in terms of plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_016", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: # The Funeral\n\n\nThe dry eaves blew along the autumn wind\n\nSinging the ocean's song to the ears in the land locked hollow.\n\nThe tops of the hills shaded the lane occasionally giving way to glimpses of a sunset as the funeral procession poured toward the family plot nestled in the back of the homestead between two limestone cliffs.\n\nDuke was waiting with his fathers casket. The preacher stood, casting a shadow over the 6 foot hole that would soon hold the memories of the old man's bones. The preacher's wife stood by duke knowing that words could not penetrate the spell of grief that silenced the young man. Nor could her own losses teach her anything about his future.\n\nDuke stood. Though his eyes were gazing down the lane, he was nowhere to be found in them.\n\nIn the blackness of his mind stood a rocky bluff, beaten by waves\n\n\"We're free, but we're in hell,\" whispered a thought.\n\nThe procession gathered in the borrowed church chairs. The indiscrete tones filled the hollow as each person clung to the edges of their mind. Not wanting to consider the haunting vision of their future. The loss was enough, though nobody knew the deceases past his steadfast oars through which he steered the generational family, donations to the church, and sparse involvement in town events. Time was this man's god, and other people were it's cost.\n\nNext to the open grave lay Duke's mother. Her headstone was clean and polished like the love that she brought Duke's heart. She was seen and known for her sacrifices to her husband and to her hands. The world had swallowed her 3 years prior. Decades too early for Duke.\n\nDuke took his seat and the preacher's wife next to him. The preacher stood with his head bowed over the casket mumbling to himself while he slowly turned to face the congregation.\n\n\"Today we honor a man\n\nWho lived his life to the letter of the law, who gave his blood to his farm, his friends, and his kin. He walked among us like an omen\n\nHe stood Collected, Kind and Disciplined.\n\nA teacher in the spirit of nature\"\n\nThe preacher opened his bible to the gospel of John and spoke a sermon about light and the old man's life. He spoke about the passage of death. That it was indefinite and celebratory. That it was indeed both an end and a beginning.\n\nThe preacher did not care for any of his words. He had stopped caring years before when the world started to change and the mirror that greeted him every morning stopped staring so kindly. His words had no answers in them anymore. They were merely shorelines for his people and he was the one tasked with saying them.\n\nEverybody was there for Duke, not for his father whose mountainous behavior left him isolated. The old man was a remnant of a fire that was dying out taking with it the emptiness of living for oneself.\n\nThe preacher's words came to a close. The sun was setting behind a cloud shrouding the grove in dark blue shadows. Duke stood from his chair and shook the preachers hand, thanking him in a rasped panicked voice. He touched the casket and placed his father's hat on it.\n\nNot knowing what to do next, he awkwardly turned around and eyed the preacher and his wife.\n\nTurning his back, he knocked on the casket and whispered\n\n\"Bye dad\"\n\nFalling out of him like a breath.\n\nHe could hear the preacher's wife directing the seated audience- a reception at the house. Duke could feel hands patting his back in comfort and murmurs of condolences. Filling in the space around him. Squeezing his chest.\n\nThe eruption of people broke the levee that Duke had created, forcing him to look up.\n\n\"I need you all to go on ahead,\" bellowing as his knees shook but he wouldn't budge. Just pressed his hands harder and harder onto the casket,\n\n\"Back to the house ya'll, I'll meet you there.\"\n\nThe preacher and his wife began corralling the procession toward the lane, as the townsfolk retrieved their chairs and loaded them into the pickup truck.\n\nThe preacher's sons had been standing at the edge of the clearing leaning on their shovels, next to the pickup truck that had brought the casket out. They stood like crows, above it and unindoctrinated in grief. Only waiting for their father's voice to command them to the task of lowering and burying Duke's father.\n\nDuke could feel a heat rapture his face as he fought back tears and a place somewhere in his lungs began to tremor begging for breath. The air was a cool liquid that he felt behind his chest and this breath had carried every other breath in his lungs. His face was enveloped in heat as his salt stung his eyes. He wiped them as he turned - nodding toward the waiting preacher and walked toward the shovel to bury his father.\n\n# The Drought\n\nThere was no rain that summer but Duke's farm had remained operational. The local reservoir had not completely run dry but it would not last as there had been many summers like this over the preceding decades. Pressed, the local farmers traded in their families heirloom properties for mansions, allowing the chain of progress to fill in behind them. What had once been thousands of acres of orchards, golden fields of wheat and corn, waves of furrows of green alfalfa, lay giant boxes placed end to end – homes for everybody from the nearby city and for all people pulled by the gravity of lower real estate costs and new lives in this suburb.\n\nThe county was becoming *that* despite the proximity to the largest city nearby being more than an hours drive. Though this once village had no association to that city, it was becoming a pre-fix to be never spoken of in its own history.\n\nDuke knew this. His father had begun witnessing it before his death several years prior. They had watched as nearby communities became absorbed by the looming monolith to industry. There were new stores and new people. The dusty shadows that had camouflaged the townsfolk had become tapestried with new shades of colors each more vibrant than the last.\n\nThe old timers hated this emergence. They would hold court at local diners and glare at every visitor that would pass through their doors.\n\nStandoffish men became bitter\n\nBitter men became silent.\n\nDuke was not among either – though his father had become the silent type. Duke had no reason for lament- the community was changing in proportion to his curiosity. At times, he thought it was his young age, but he was not much younger than most bitter ranchers left. This farm had been the anchor of his family's heart for 4 generations. The trees and rocks had become the song that his life breathed through. The farm was the only hearth that he had known. Playing in it as a respite, then ultimately knowing it as his own personal clock.\n\nThis year, the ground was dustier and dying. He pulled only 3 out of 5 cuttings. 1 less then the year prior. There would be no profit this year. The few cattle that he ran could not diminish like his crops but no profit meant no feed and seed. No feed and seed meant that his farm might take the inevitable passage that had pulled his cohorts.\n\n-----\n\nThe August sun bore down on Duke's shoulders as he walked the lane to the family cemetery. The leaves from the bordering trees gave his skin intermittent relief and a quiet breeze dried his sweat. The cottonwoods swallowed Duke's eyes and the old knots and hallowed trunks warmed his chest with the feeling that a part of him was cocooned in their bark.\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket for the handkerchief to wipe his brow. He arrived at the family plot to see first his fathers grave, covered in grass and prairie flower. Adjacent his mothers tombstone lay prominently marking his loss 6 years prior. They were both from this county, though his mother was an only child and her family's line had come to a close with her. He never imagined their bodies to mingle in decay. They were separate and distinct from each other in their marriage and would be apart even through death, until the earth claimed their coffins too.\n\nThere were 4 generations of men, women, and some children in this cemetery. The bones of Duke's family stretched across the historical divide from homesteader to rancher. Though parcels had been sold off over the century, this land had seen the Great Depression and the advent of million dollar tractors. Duke wasn't sentimental but the farm was the only thing he knew. The cold cement echoed against his face as his cheeks tingled underneath his beard.\n\n\"Dad, I don't know if this land is gunna make it. The water's gone, the sun's got hotter, the feed's doubled in price and there's no sign of it lettin' up. I know you said stick with it. That this farm is bigger than me or you. But I think God's got other plans. Buck next door is selling. He's got a nice price for it. Nothing like the offers that you got. The dirt's dust. I don't see it getting wetter. I don't feel the end.\n\nI know what your gunna say, 'don't let the city get you. Don't be swallowed by the swarm.\n\nBut you know, it's only a matter of time with no rain.\n\nMomma, I know you never much cared for this place. I know you'd itch to leave as soon as a door opened.\"\n\nThe sun was soft but still warm. The clouds were dispersing in the distance and the grove held nothing but silence. Duke could hear his own searching. He felt embarrassed that he even had to ask. Duke felt like he was performing. Somehow he believed that he was supposed to already know the answer. Already know how to navigate this changing tide. He knew there was no one there to answer and the emptiness that his words fell against made him feel like a fool.\n\nWith frustration, he turned around and started marching his way back to the house. What answers had his father? He was dead. What good were his bones but a memory of his forms inevitable end? The hubris of his father to think that he could out last the great machine. His own hubris for even considering that he was an exception to the rule.\n\nCapable of selling or not, this land had shaped him and his very mind. He did not know himself apart from it. Every fiber of his being resisted the claim to be separate from the land. To be an individual pressing into the monolithic new age and bouncing off the new curiosities that modern industry had to offer. Duke knew that he was at a threshold and there was no exit that his heart could conjure to depart from his ever growing anguish – there was only suffocation.\n\nThe sun was beginning to set as Duke made it to the porch steps. There was nothing waiting for him inside except a few beers and a roast he cooked the night before. Wandering around his yard, he picked up the loose pieces of trash that had blown in from other parts of the property. Bringing the refuse to his garbage can, he went inside knowing there was no way to ease his consternation. There was no way out of his binding blade.\n\n# The Echo\n\nDuke drained the rocks of their energy. The land no longer harnessed the power of the soul. The fields became barren and void. The cows mingled slower to the troughs and the limits of Duke's hopes shown unearthed. The trees lived like they always had, bordering the homestead. The green that used to illuminate the center of the farm transformed itself into a papyrus brown as life from that spring that had fed the land so generously emptied without replenishment – the rocks drying out.\n\nLight pressed through the blinds into Dukes room. The pools of dust whirled in the rays of sunlight at the foot of his bed. Duke stared, absorbed in its clou,d watching the space between the dust. Watching currents move while the light remained stationary. He was already late to feed the cattle, but they had become accustomed to a daylit breakfast, adjusting for their caretakers evening habits.\n\nStaggering out of bed he found his irrigation boots and made his way to the barn to load his ATV with hay. The hungry herd was waiting, singing to each other in their semicircle. Duke broke apart the bale and splayed the flakes for the beasts. His head was booming and swirling as his stomach felt like it was sucked into his spine. His hands were tremoring as he took off his gloves – he reminded himself that he only needed to keep them alive until the next season. Grabbing the truck keys, he trudged to the drive-way and hopped into his silver truck.\n\nNobody was on the road this Sunday morning. They were either in church or away- looking to rediscover their foothold in nature. Nobody was there to witness Duke wrestle with the strongest motivation to pull his car into each passing power pole, every ditch, every large boulder. It would take nothing but a swift jerk of the wheel to the left or the right, to find a home in the immediate compression as his truck flung him to his timely death. He had watched it happen over and over in his head. This was his landscape to his journey townward. This was the road that Duke feared every time he stepped into that truck since his father's passing. He could feel the water in him asking for a way out but every day he kept driving, his hands becoming tighter and tighter against the steering wheel as the weeks turned into months, his hands becoming tighter as his negotiation set deeper into his jaw, then into his chest, then to his lungs where a small pocket of air carried the rest of him.\n\nDuke passed the city limits sign slowing his resolve while he anticipated the path to his gas station. The lot was empty but for the owner's car. He parked his truck and walked in through the glass door; nodding at the man behind the counter reading his newspaper. These two needed no words, the owner had known Duke since he had purchased the timeless store. Duke grabbed his 12 pack from the cooler, a sandwich from the heater, a pack of gum, cup of coffee, and walked up to the register.\n\n\"Now you know its dry today, I tell you every Sunday. The law don't let me sell on Sundays. You want your beer, drive the 20 minutes to the next county\"\n\nDuke stood blankly, though the sleep was out of his eyes, he still felt the weight of it holding down his eyelids.\n\n\"You know days don't work like that out here\"\n\nThe shopkeeper said nothing\n\nDuke shrugged\n\nPutting the daily provisions down he walked up to the register. He tossed his sandwich on the counter. I'll take 50 on pump 2\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded\n\n\"You want your tickets?\"\n\nDuke Shook his head\n\nHe walked out making his way to the bed of his truck. Sitting and drinking his morning cup while his tank fueled.\n\nA green crossover rolled into the station's parking lot filled with a family. 2 little brown boys, a girl, and their parents. Duke eyed them inquisitively – there had been new people coming into town for the last couple of decades but this family pulled his attention. Their presence forced air down his chest and a small tremor sang from a space behind his ribs. Duke could feel his bones for the first time since his father died. They quivered and ached against the bed of his truck.\n\nHe watched as the family filed out of the car- the father exhausted but smiling, the mother resting in her own enchantment, like she had won herself over. The children reminded him of his school days. One was quietly watching while the other two played a slapping game as the family swirled into the gas station. The parents waved and Duke returned the gesture with barely enough time for them to see before they approached the door.\n\nDuke's tank finished fueling\n\nHe took a sip of coffee and slipped off the back of his truck.\n\n------\n\nHe drove homeward meandering from back road to back road, not knowing who was driving. He found the road to the highway that led south to the nearest county. In the years preceding, there were no events that marked his days nor an inner will to admit that he had lost contact with his sense of time. The highway took him 10 minutes to the adjacent county that wasn't dry on Sundays. Pulling into the first gas station, he sat in the moment between the truck halting and the release of his key in the ignition – his lips pursed and his fingers tapping the steering wheel. Traffic had picked up picked up carrying church goes home creating a wall of noise. Duke was met with a lull in the flow revealing the sounds of shifting metal creak in his ears while his truck settled.\n\nA glint in his eye and a glimmer of a sneer marked his descent from the truck. Duke marched through the gas station door. Entranced as he opened the door, he made his way to the gas cans on the bottom shelf. Grabbing 4, he waltzed to the counter.\n\n# The Passage\n\n*Bottled Tempests*\n\n*Scorching the summers weave*\n\n*Ashes to Ashes*\n\n*Dust to Dust*\n\nDukes blood pulsed with each step. With each step his face became tighter and tighter. He shut the curtains in his parents bedroom, preserved as it had been since nobody slept there these days. The dust didn't bother him, but this day he could see just how much had gathered on the linens. His boots echoed across the wood floors as he went from window to window, yanking the cloth shut. Grabbing one of the gas cans, he flung the petrol across the mattress that his parents had rested their limbs on for decades.\n\nHe tipped the container over at the doorway and watched the puddle spread between the floor boards. Duke barreled to the guest room and did the same thing. He spied the pictures on the wall that were a testament to his mother's interior decorating. Taking them off the wall and tossing them on the floor he emptied the second container over the glass and wood.\n\nHe trudged to his room and flipped his bed over . The mattress slammed into the window sending shards of glass to the backyard, 2 stories below. He cleared the clothes out of the closet and dumped them on the bed. Dukes hands started to shake as he emptied the third container. The fumes burned the inside of his nose.\n\nThe smell was not transitive, it neither carried him to any memory nor even attracted his attention at all. In truth, Duke was intoxicated by the fumes and drank them in, feeling the touch and timbre in his throat.\n\nHe finished dousing the third room and set out to finish the rest of the house. At this point the bottoms of his boots were wet and the floor had become slick. He leaped down the stairs with the fourth and last container of fuel. Drenching the front room of his family's farmhouse. The shadows from the already closed curtains danced around the center of the room. His home was unrecognizable. The couches that he had slept on sat motionless and stale. There was no one there. There was nothing left living in that old home.\n\nDuke took the final container and removed the cap. He timidly made his way to the front door that he had entered and exited thousands of times. His boots getting wetter and wetter. The door warred with him. His eyes became absorbed in the seams of the wood. The knots and rings pulling him into them. The brass hinges, made by his great grandfather, reflected the sepia light in the room. He felt his face getting tighter and tighter and pressure in his lips became unbearable as he reached forward.\n\n-----\n\nThe door flew open as he fell to his feet\n\nThe earth took his wound and he gave it his life.\n\nHe walked onto the dirt in front of him\n\nLetting the light fall on his face and the air became pregnant fire.\n\nThe earth bore it and moved him to his car\n\nHe stepped into the cab and drove away.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "In the aftermath, the once lush farmland bloomed, an inferno of flames licked at the night sky. The mournful clouds that lingered above were no match for the relentless, consuming blaze. Duke's home, his family's legacy, his very soul, was devoured by the fire he had unleashed.\n\nThe town awoke in a state of shock and grief, not for Duke, but for the life that had been extinguished alongside the flames. Duke had been a silent, stoic figure in the town, his presence felt more by the absence of his conversation rather than the depth of it. As news spread, the townsfolk remembered their own losses, their own battles with time and change. There were no words, no condolences for a man who had vanished along with the embers that had been his home.\n\nThe official investigation concluded with the same conclusion that Duke's actions painted in broad strokes — a man lost to his grief, consumed by the very farm that he loved. It was a narrative that resonated but not for the entirety of Duke's life. People recalled his unwavering dedication, his quiet strength, and his unspoken sacrifices. He was a man who had given himself over to the land until it rendered him obsolete.\n\nThe fire had cleansed the land. Where once stood a remnant of the past, now space had opened. The land, freed from the binds of a vanishing way of life, began to breathe. The soil, kissed by the ashes of Duke's final act, would soon be fertile once again.\n\nAs the flames died down, the town began to rebuild, not just from the rubble of Duke's house, but from the memories of their collective past. The new people coming in found a community determined to honor its roots while embracing a future that was no longer defined by the past.\n\nIn time, the land bore new fruit and new families. The young boys who had caught Duke's eye at the gas station grew up, became local legends, and, like Duke, chose to honor the legacy of their land and their history.\n\nThe farm that Duke had torched became a symbol of rebirth, a reminder to those who lived there of the power of change and the importance of accepting it. Duke, in his final act, had given back to the earth what he had taken from it, and in doing so, had returned the gift of life to the very land that had shaped his story.\n\nAnd so, the land lived on, a testament to the cycles of life and death, of loss and rebirth.

{"id": "text_completion_017", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: I have a ghost.\n\n\nIn my house. I think.\n\nMy husband.\n\nI think.\n\nI'm tapping loudly on my computer. I do everything loudly now. I bang open cabinets, slam drawers, pound my fuzzy slippers heavily on the ground. To let the ghost know I'm here. To warn him of my presence. Because it's when I'm sneaking… that he finds me.\n\nThis house aches. I ache - that kind of … rich people ache. A clean, hollow, Hitchcockian ache. A whistling ache. The wind rips right through you. I know because I've been both. A poor person's ache feels damp. Heavy. Waterlogged. The wind can't rip it. Nothing can.\n\nI inherited this house. And ghosts aren't the only things I've inherited with it. Brown widows (me?). Brown recluses (also me). Spindly creepy crawly heat-seeking things, determined to share my life. To take refuge from the doldrums of our island's winter tantrums. I've been alone here for a year and a half, but still, every time I flip on a light switch to reveal a fat centipede skitter under my bed, or a gilt edged silver fish looking up at me from the clawfoot tub - hot terror catches me.\n\nAll creatures I somehow never remember seeing while my husband was alive. Sometimes I wonder if the house is really mine, or if it was always theirs. With the ringing absence of my late husband's stewardship, it is changing hands, being returned back to the land. And the original owners are finding their way in through the cracks. Foundations loosening. Spirits and bugs welcome.\n\nLooking at me, you wouldn't think I'm the type to be haunted by the ghost of a husband who can't move on. And yet, I fear, that is exactly what is happening.\n\nIt's a little flattering, really. At 38, I've kept up pretty good. Mainly, my hair. It's a little brassy from decades of blonde bottle dye, the ends crispy and straw-like, but I have not yet succumbed to that short haircut women fall victim to at my age. The haircut of a woman disappearing. A certain time of year I sport a rich, golden tan. But a lifetime of beach bumming with no sunscreen has taken its toll. My face dotted with faint patches and lines, settlers upon this land, seizing it and claiming it as their own. I've got the skinny legs of a teenager. Of a sand piper's, nearly invisible, scurrying away from the crash of the shore. But my top half resembles that of a dumpling. Storing all my softness at my center, with heaving breasts like overripe fruit. My thinness radiating out, trying its best to stretch away, to defy the pull of a centrifugal dough ball force. I have small brown eyes. Almond shaped and light, like watery coffee with shiny hazel flecks. Big full lips, and a flat ass. A few tattoos. From over the years. Maybe a few more than I'd like. But, they prove good conversation starters anyway. I'm regular white, but don't always look it, no one knows why. A Portuguese grandad on my mom's side, I've heard? But like most family lore… probably meaningless.\n\nI pad my way down the spiral staircase that dizzyingly dumps me at the door.\n\n\"Coming down!\" I elongate the syllables like I'm trying them out for the first time.\n\n—\n\nMarch on the coast is unnerving.\n\nBlock Island has abandonment issues.\n\nShe shivers and creaks and forces you to love her. Once the tourists and second-homers pack up at the end of summer, she gives her chosen ones sixty days of pure pleasure, reigniting their shaken faith. Devilishly drawing them in, captivating them … until they become captive. Blinded by her piercing beauty, her golden September afternoons, her sweet loganberry harvest, the best of her treasures saved for the most loyal. Her October plenty. Her blazing red leaves and edible purple skies. Her bright salty mornings and crab boil nights. She wraps you in her arms so tight that come November - you can't breathe. You're being - choked. Her thrashing waters, a bride in hysterics. She cries \"Why does everyone leave me?\" \"Why can't they stay when I need them most?\" The storm of her petulance tiring even herself out. Then, her loneliness turns punishing. \"I love you, don't leave me\". \"Prove that you love me. Prove you won't ever leave. If you truly love me, take my choppy seas and caustic winds. Take my blistering freeze, my cavernous hallows. Can you take it? My shrouded mourning gown, my grey forever.\"\n\nSo we do. Until summer, when growing fat off the adoration of mere strangers, she turns her sun gaze away from the ones who steadied her in her bleak fit of winter. Bitterly, we blame the trampling tourist - you know the kind, throwing his money around and leaving. But deep down, every New Shoreham resident understands, if we sit still within ourselves, our ire is misplaced. That our woman chose someone else to shine on. We are back in competition with the handsome drifter.\n\nSo, March. March on the island is as sapless as it is serpentine. As dull as it is aching. Call it cabin fever. Call it winter blues. Call it anything other than what it is. A desire to leave.\n\n—\n\nMy marriage to Jordan was fine. Really! We loved each other in a way that is truly underrated: A love balanced on the scales of \"You don't acknowledge my flaws, and I won't acknowledge yours.\" We supported each other and stayed out of each others way. The sort of love that has fallen out of fashion now. The kind where I didn't work and I was fine with that. The kind where you both get what you asked for, then realize you both asked for the wrong thing, but you stick with it anyway. The kind where we never wanted kids because we never wanted to rouse such strong feelings. Even for each other. We did have a dog named Chester. And we loved him a medium amount. So it's… strange that… now that Jordan's dead… he wants me so bad.\n\nI swipe my keys off the hook and zip my coat. A big puffy one I found in the attic. Forest green with a khaki collar. I smooth balm from the pocket over my chapping lips. I feel like he's watching me. Even now.\n\n\"I'm going out\" I yell, into the stagnant air.\n\n—\n\nThe door chimes as I slink from the pitiless, ashen afternoon into the dark bar. Warm and humming - the belly of the whale. I sidle up and in the mirror, catch myself flipping my hair to one side and over my shoulder with wanton flair.\n\nI had been a waitress all my life. Well, my previous life. My pre-Jordan life. Since I was 14, I worked the Rhode Inn every summer, wearing white t-shirts that read \"Rhode Hard and Put Away Wet\". That's where we met, actually. He was a city boy. Boston. Invested some capital in a few of our local dives along the coast. Degree in Finance, the whole bit. Did a good job, really. Not overbearing, not trying to \"class it up\", corporatize us. They were popular little joints, so he wasn't trying to fix what wasn't broke.\n\n\"Want some oysters, Kat? Boat just came in.\" Trish stood comfortably, some rags in hand, her red hair gelled back into one severe ponytail.\n\n\"Nah, I'm OK.\"\n\n\"Ky's out back.\" She says, her back to me.\n\nHer knees crack as she squats down, pulling sharpie-dated quart containers of soupy, red cocktail sauce out of a low boy. I try to sound casual, like I'm not quite sure why she'd be telling me where Ky is.\n\n\"Oh. OK.\"\n\nKy was my weakness. Is now, and always will be forever, amen. The broad, thick chest of a working man. Sea grey eyes, and the touch of someone whose presence is so crushing he had to learn, the hard way, how to handle the delicate things he loomed over. Hapless and unpolished, but careful. A hearty grin when he'd give it.\n\nI fidget with my wallet while Trish slides me a Sam Adams.\n\n\"Put that away!\" she scolds.\n\n\"Thanks.\" I smile sheepishly.\n\nI put a coaster over my beer after the first sip and fish a pack of cigarettes out of my pocket.\n\n—\n\nBehind the restaurant, I hover. My plan is to wait for him to say something first. To happen upon me.\n\n\"Kat! Heads up!\"\n\nIt's Tony. My favorite pint-sized maniac, unloading ingredients from the back of a box truck with feverish irregularity. I look in the direction of his voice, and he lobs an industrial bag of sea salt at my head. I dodge it just in time. It puts out my cigarette.\n\n\"What the FUCK Tony!\" I yelp.\n\n\"You'll live!\" He responds brightly, as I fumble with my lighter.\n\n\"Havin' a drink?\" He asks, candy-coated in envy. He slaps one commercial kitchen sized vacuum sealed pork loin over each shoulder and hops off the truck, his knees buckling ever-so-slightly.\n\nI nod, taking a long drag.\n\n\"You can have that, by the way. It's expired.\" His \"i's\" wide and throaty, an old-school New England accent stuck around his tonsils.\n\n\"Whatdoyathink I'm gonna need a five pound bag of expired salt for?\"\n\n\"Your drive way!\" Tony yells forcefully, rolling his eyes.\n\n\"Always tryin' ta provide for the helpless widow…\" I jab back, with over-measured precision and pitch perfect volume, aimed just-so at the back of the truck. Hoping Ky can hear.\n\nJust then, Ky emerges, hauling clams, headed for the walk-in.\n\n\"I could think of something else to do with a helpless widow…\" He breathes, brushing my coat with his crooked elbow.\n\nThe air between us sharpens.\n\nAnd my unfortunate first thought is: Jordan.\n\nDammit. I might need this salt after all.\n\n—\n\nAmid the dregs of winter, having no job and a dead husband, I found I left the house less and less— which meant I rarely saw it from this angle. I pull into the driveway and idle, craning my neck up.\n\nIt's impressive. Built in 1888, it's a classic example of the Victorian style of architecture known as Queen Anne. Nantucket blue with white trim and cranberry stained accents. Three sweeping stories embraced by a wrap-around porch with turned posts, decorative brackets, and spindlework.\n\nIts asymmetrical facade gives it the character of a person. Multifaceted, tiresome. Showing some things off with a flourish of Dutch gables—and concealing others, the way we do. Its most prominent features on display like stories we tell over and over at parties. Its second-story balcony almost pouts with disuse, sagging slightly under a proud polygonal turret, dramatically built on a series of bay windows—a final, trumpeting declaration. \"I used to be someone, something\".\n\nNot sure Jordan's parents were too thrilled when he left the house solely to me. But they retained the Boston assets, washed me out of their Supper Club hair, and I got to stay. Here. At home. The island of my teenaged summers.\n\nAnd so did Jordan. Apparently.\n\n—\n\n\"I'm home!\" I bang and crash through the foyer. \"It's fucking freezing in here.\" I say aloud, the door slamming behind me.\n\nIt is then that I see it— four french doors helplessly thrashing against their frames in the wind. Cabinets in the kitchen all open. Whisks and muddlers violently askew on the floor. Umbrellas spilled from a shattered standing vase.\n\nThen a side-splitting howl, as an angry gust of sea wind whips through the naked, open channel that is now my house. Suddenly, I kneel to the ground and weep. I give up. Why is he doing this to me?\n\n—\n\nIt didn't make sense. One, he didn't die here. In the house. He died in a car accident. A little over a year ago. In Providence, on his way home from a lunch meeting. If people are going to haunt, they're usually going to do it at the *site* of their death. Stuck there. Unwilling to move on, but unable to exist outside a loop, playing out their death over and over, trying to get it right this time. I know because I've done my research. Had a psychic over in November. A local woman with soft white hair piled on her head, an excess of earrings, and virtually non-stop chatter about angels. She refused to step beyond the porch, claiming she felt she wasn't \"invited\" by the house, until I reminded her *I'm the one* \"inviting\" her to make that $100/hour she insisted on.\n\nSo. She tells me. If your loved one turns into a ghost, a haunting, a spirit caught between planes, it's either because:\n\n\n\n1. Their death was untimely\n2. Their death was horrifically violent.\n\nOK. Jordan was 49 when he died. So yes, too young. But not exceedingly young. Not \"he had his whole life ahead of him\" young. I mean, not two generations ago, that was a perfectly reasonable age to forever etch on a tombstone. His car accident, as tragic as it was, wasn't exceptionally horrific either. Just your average death. Pretty symbolic of a lot in Jordan's life.\n\nBut *even if* those two criteria were met, the psychic assured me that spirits of the departed are *still* likely to haunt the place they died in.\n\nBut he's not haunting a busy stretch of I-95… He's haunting me.\n\nHe died in me.\n\nSomehow.\n\n\"And one more thing\" she said. Stopping me, as her glasses fogged, one foot out the door, her pale eyes growing paler. \"It could be unfinished business. That's c.\" The ABCs of haunting.\n\nUnfinished business. The unfinished business of what exactly? I loved him—I want to make that one thing clear. I did love him. I smile when I think about his jet dark hair, perfect in that boxy, side-parted Republican way. His brooding countenance - the sort of etched severity that promises trouble below. Except with Jordan, there was no darkness. He had no demons. That was just how his face looked.\n\nI miss his big vocabulary, that phone voice he reserved for \"business calls\", the fake laugh he used on demanding restaurant patrons, or that easy way he fell asleep, every limb draped over mine.\n\nHe was never vindictive. Never looking for ways people could hurt him, the way I do. Sure, maybe… maybe we'd've been better off as friends, but we also *wanted* the same things: Comfort. This beach. Cold beer. This house. Using Chester-the-unruly-dog as an alibi to never visit his parents or sister. A medium sized boat.\n\nHe was never this passionate in life. He wasn't even particularly stubborn. Unfinished business felt so uncharacteristically romantic by comparison. My throat itches as I wonder if the unfinished business we had was in never loving each other recklessly. Totally. Always skating through life unannounced. Never asking ourselves \"Isn't it supposed to be more beautiful than this?\"\n\nNow, I sweep up the broken vase and put the kitchen back together. It's the best I can do.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2.

The brown spiders and the silver fish retreated back into the walls; the centipedes vanished as if they too were running from the return of warmth—or perhaps, from the intrusive ghosts haunting our home.\n\nWith the return of daylight, I began to notice a pattern. The house was its most agitated before dawn, when the shadows stretched and the walls seemed to groan with the weight of unseen presences. The sunrise brought a quiet. As if whatever energy animated the house at night was drained by the morning light. Perhaps the sun itself was the bane of my ghostly visitor.\n\nThe days grew warmer, and with them, my resolve strengthened. I resolved to bring the house back to life, to fill the empty rooms with laughter, conversation, and the clatter of living. To confront the ghost of my husband not as a specter of dread, but as a reminder of the love we once shared—and the life we built together.\n\nI started by gathering the scattered mementos of our marriage—photos, tickets stubs, little trinkets we’d collected over the years. I arranged them on the mantelpiece, creating a shrine to our shared past. I’d sit there every morning, whispering to Jordan, telling him about the dreams I still held, the fears I grappled with, and the love I felt for him even now.\n\nSlowly, the house began to respond. The french doors stopped thrashing in the wind, the cabinets closed of their own accord, and the umbrellas returned to their stand as if by magic. It was as if the presence of my memories had begun to soothe the restless spirit.\n\nBut even as the house grew more tranquil, I knew I had to confront Jordan’s ghost directly. One night, as the moon hung low and the sea whispered against the shore, I ventured up to the attic—the place where I imagined his spirit lingered.\n\nThe attic was a labyrinth of shadows and dust motes, but amidst the clutter, I saw it—a shadow that coalesced into the familiar shape of my husband. My heart raced, but I steadied myself, mustering the courage to speak.\n\n“Jordan,” I whispered, my voice breaking the silence. “Why won’t you leave me alone?”\n\nThe shadow seemed to shift, as if in response to my words. I swallowed hard, taking a step closer.\n\n“I loved you,” I continued, my voice gaining strength. “But I can’t live in the past. I need to move on. Please… let me go.”\n\nFor a moment, there was only silence. Then, as if carried by the wind, I heard his voice—or perhaps it was just the sound of the sea, whispering secrets of the deep.\n\n“I love you too,” the wind seemed to say. “But it’s time for us both to let go.”\n\nWith those words, the shadow dissipated, leaving behind only the sound of the waves and the creaking of the house settling into the night. I realized then that Jordan’s presence had been a manifestation of my own grief, a phantom bound to the life we’d built together.\n\nAs the sun rose the next morning, I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. The house felt lighter, as if it too had been holding its breath, waiting for the ghost of Jordan to be set free. I walked through the rooms, touching the walls, feeling the warmth of the morning sun on my face.\n\nIn that moment, I understood that the haunting had never been about the house or the ghosts that lingered within its walls. It had been about me—about my inability to let go of the past, to accept that Jordan had moved on, and that it was time for me to do the same.\n\nWith a heart lighter than it had been in a year, I stepped out into the world, ready to embrace the life that lay ahead. The ghosts of the past would always be with me, but they no longer had the power to hold me back. I was free to live again, to love again, and to dream again.\n\nAnd as I walked away from the house, I could almost swear I heard Jordan’s voice in the wind, whispering words of love and encouragement. Perhaps it was just the sound of the sea, perhaps it was something more.

{"id": "text_completion_018", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: It had been decided that the machine must go. I didn\"t find myself agreeing with Major Milic very much these days. His methods were harsh, brutal and he had become a fanatic. I\"d call him more of a terrorist than a freedom fighter. But he was right, the machine had to go. I didn\"t have any confidence we could do it, however.\n\n\nThe resistance had changed in the last couple years. The Emperor\"s personal secret project was brought online. Though it was round, it wasn\"t like it the \"Death Star.\" This Empire was real, and it made smarter decisions. It spent its time and money on a brain. CyCLOPS- Cybernetic, Control, Law-enforcement, and Online Policing System- changed the rules of human nature more and more every day. It make it possible for a few people to effectively watch the entire human populace at once. It watched, it learned, it analyzed, it predicted, and it remembered with perfect clarity all at a single time.\n\nI had been surprised at first when Major Milic rescued me from my prison, but not when I figured out what he planned to do. He needed me for two reasons. One- I could fly helicopters, the old ones without autopilot. Two- I knew where CyCLOPS was. And I suppose a third reason too; I would never turn him into the Imperial Union.\n\nI agreed to help, not that I had a lot of choice when everything I knew was lost and there was a gun in my face. I left the prison behind, but all the while knowing I would die with them instead.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCyCLOPS is not easy to get near. It was secret to begin with, but they knew better than to rely on that alone. Through torture, Major Milic\"s loyal team discovered a lot information about the facility. Though most work with it is done remotely, it has over 500 that work directly with the machine on-site. These are mostly fat technicians and overpaid civilians, not that Milic recognized civilians anymore. They wouldn\"t put up much of a fight when push came to shove.\n\nThe security came from a reinforced, mixed-guard company made up of Sentinels and Assault Forces. One company of three platoons. Each platoon covered a 12-hour shift. One was on days, one on nights, one on recovery cycle at all times. They had six guard towers with heavy machine guns on the walled perimeter. The walls were made of carbonized concrete, the gate was heavy metal and automatic, and there was electrified razor wire across the top. Four roving patrols covered the exterior of the facility, rejecting any trespassers onto the \"Navajo Sanctuary Reservation.\" At least one large armored vehicle was ready at all times for a quick reaction force. The rest of the on-shift platoon patrolled the inside of the compound and checked key points.\n\nIf at any point the guards caught wind of our approach and intentions, the other platoons would be woken and activated as reserves. An entire company of heavily armed and armored Sentinels would be vastly too much to deal with, and we\"d be slaughtered. We had to 1- approach undetected, 2- blind the guard towers so they could not shoot down our helicopters, 3- secure the barracks and take the reserves hostage before they could get to their arms room, 4- deal with the existing guards in the compound, 5- lock the gate to prevent the roving patrols from returning with more firepower, 6- break into and make our way into the facility, and at last, 7- blow CyCLOPS to high hell. None of the major processor banks can survive. No one knows the extent of its capabilities for certain, besides the Emperor and his chosen team, but it may likely begin to back up its data to external servers outside of the facility. The more we can destroy, the more we\"ve set back the Empire, and the more time we've bought for a larger resistance to mobilize.\n\nThey are dependent on the machine now. They will be weaker than they were before it\"s installation. But first, we had to get there. And I had a bad feeling. So many things could go wrong.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI listened as intently as I could to Milic\"s briefing. He\"d thought of everything. Even from his little bunker hidden away from the world, he\"d managed to gather a lot of intelligence. From his position at the top of the map, he could point out every section of the base, where we would land, where the satellite communications were, where the barracks and arms rooms were, where we would enter the facility, and more. I wasn\"t sure how he knew all of this. I think I didn\"t want to know.\n\n\"Sam, are you fuckin\" paying attention!?\" His eyes seemed to glow from the light reflected off the map in the otherwise dark bunker.\n\n\"What? Yes. I know where to land.\" Truthfully I\"d never been the same since that prison. I couldn\"t focus on anything too long.\n\n\"But after that?\"\n\n\"What... what am I doing after that? That wasn\"t... I didn\"t agree to-\"\n\n\"I don\"t give a shit. You\"re with me. I\"m not letting you out of my sight.\"\n\n\"Who\"s going to stay with the helicopter?\"\n\n\"Jacob will keep it running.\" He pointed to Powell, next to me. Anyone who knew him called him Powell. Only people who pretended to know him called him Jake or Jacob. They\"d had a long history, but that told me how close they weren\"t. Powell\"s eyes locked with mine for a moment then looked away. He was a hostage here, too. He was the man that taught me to fly. He was old now. So was I.\n\n\"I\"m not shooting anyone.\"\n\n\"That\"s fine. You\"ll help carry explosives. You\"ve got no problem blowing this thing up. That\"s what we agreed on, right?\"\n\n\"Okay... right. I\"m with you.\"\n\n\"You\"re attached to my hip. You go where I fuckin\" tell you and nowhere else. Is that understood?\"\n\n\"I\"m with you.\" I growled.\n\n\"3rd squad, alpha-team\"s goals are the communications array...\" he continued. But again, I already wasn\"t listening. A faint whining grew in my ears, and I faded out into one of my blackout spells. After coming all this way, and everything I\"ve worked for- everything I did to fight the Empire- it was probably Milic that was going to kill me.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDuring pre-flight checks with Powell, we talked a little bit. It was nice. I climbed up on top of the back of the bird to give the yoke a good look.\n\n\"This piece of shit is not gonna fly.\" I interjected, looked at the rust near the blade hub.\n\n\"It\"ll fly. I flew it yesterday.\"\n\n\"The rotors are going to fall off before we get there.\"\n\n\"No... but we\"re in for a bumpy ride. She definitely handles like a... heh heh, Sammy, you remember that old two-seater we flew up to that Appalachian relay station?\"\n\n\"Oh dear god, we almost died. On three separate occasions.\" I grinned.\n\n\"We\"ve been through tougher spots.\" Powell grinned too and climbed up the other side. His entire bald head wrinkled when he smiled.\n\n\"Yeah... but we were younger men. And the Empire didn\"t rule the world yet.\"\n\n\"Nothing lasts forever. Not youth, and not this crummy empire. They all fall down eventually. We\"re just giving it a good shove.\"\n\n\"You really think we\"re going to win?\" my grin faded. That old feeling returned.\n\n\"I think so. Major Milic\"s got his plan down tight. He\"s resourced everything he needs. We have our opening. You don\"t think we can?\"\n\nThe yoke, despite several conditions I would normally reject, appeared okay. The blades were in surprisingly good condition. It would fly all the way to the scene of the crash. \"I don\"t think so.\"\n\n\"You need to give the guy more credit. I know you don\"t agree with his methods, but he\"s a warrior. This is what he was built for. You have that prison mindset still. The walls are all closed in around you.\"\n\n\"Oh I don\"t think it\"s the prison that got to me,\" I looked out into the setting sun of the evening. The scenery from up here was incredible.\n\n\"Is this about Lindsey?\"\n\n\"No. Lindsey\"s gone. This is about us. Now. Though I admit, it\"s hard to forget her face with a bullet in it. I\"m glad she\"s not here to see this. This is going to be... a mess.\"\n\nPowell reached up and grabbed my hand and held it in both of his. \"You\"ve gotta have a little faith in this team. They know what they\"re doing.\"\n\n\"I know. But this team never met the Emperor. I\"ve met him, and... No one on earth knows what they\"re doing compared to him. He sees everything coming.\"\n\n\"Sam, you have to believe we can win.\"\n\n\"I know... there\"s a chance we can win. But we need to be ready.

Below, the lights of the city flickered like the last vestiges of humanity—a place where once, life had throbbed with laughter, joy and freedom. Now, it was a shadow of its former self, a silent witness to the rise and dominance of the Empire. \n\nBeneath the blanket of the night, the team prepared their gear for the mission ahead. It was a silent orchestra of movements; each team member knew their role, their place. It was a dance rehearsed in the darkness of their hearts, a desperate bid for freedom against an iron-fisted ruler who sought to quash all dissent.\n\nSam looked over at Powell. The older man's eyes were sharp, yet there was a weariness that tugged at the corners of his mouth. Sam knew that Powell, too, had once been a warrior, a freedom fighter, but now aged by time and circumstance. Yet here he was, still standing, still ready to fight for a cause he believed in.\n\nPowell nodded towards the chopper. \"Let's get this done. We need to stick to the plan if we're going to pull this off. Every second we delay, the risk grows.\"\n\nSam nodded, his face a mask of determination. He understood the gravity of their mission. He had lost too much already, too many people, too many moments of joy and happiness, to the Empire. He would not let this chance slip through their fingers.\n\nThe chopper engines started up, the sound a roar in the still night air. Sam secured himself in the cockpit, double-checking the controls. He had flown many times before, but this time was different. This time, the fate of the resistance rested on his shoulders.\n\nAs they flew over the city, Sam couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. The city had once been his home, his playground, his sanctuary. Now, it was a place of fear and oppression, a reminder of what they were fighting against. But amidst the darkness, there was a spark, a glimmer of hope that refused to be extinguished.\n\nThe facility came into view, a dark silhouette against the night sky. It was a behemoth, a monolith of power and control, a fortress that seemed impregnable. But Sam knew that no fortress was truly unbreakable. It needed to be breached, to be torn down from within.\n\nAs they approached, the plan unfolded like a complex dance. The chopper weaved through the sky, avoiding detection, while the rest of the team worked from the ground, systematically disabling the defenses. It was a delicate operation, one that required precision and timing. But they had trained for this, they had prepared for this. They were a team, a united front against the tyranny of the Empire.\n\nSam watched as the guards were taken out, one by one, their cries of surprise and fear cut short. It was a残酷 reality, but it was necessary. They had no choice but to fight, to resist, to defend their right to freedom.\n\nThe moment of truth came as they breached the facility's main entrance. Sam's heart pounded in his chest, a drum of determination. He knew that failure was not an option. They had come too far, sacrificed too much, to turn back now.\n\nThe blast of the explosion echoed through the facility, a sound that marked the beginning of the end for CyCLOPS. Sam and the team moved quickly, securing the area, ensuring that no threat remained. They had done it. They had breached the heart of the Empire's control, and they had succeeded.\n\nAs they stood amidst the ruins of the facility, Sam felt a weight lift from his shoulders. They had done it. They had proven that even in the darkest of times, there was always hope, always the possibility of victory. The Empire may have been powerful, but they were not invincible. They could be defeated, they could be overthrown.\n\nSam looked around at his team, his comrades, his family. They had fought together, they had sacrificed together, and they had won together. They had found a way to fight back against the darkness, to reclaim their freedom, their humanity.\n\nAnd as the first light of dawn broke over the horizon, Sam knew that this was just the beginning. The resistance was growing, the fight was far from over, but they had taken a crucial step towards a future where freedom reigned supreme.\n\nThe Empire may have controlled the present, but the people, united in their resolve, would shape the future.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text in terms of plot, character development, and tone.

{"id": "text_completion_019", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: My name is Kristin Renee Saunders, and my life has become crazy in a big fucking way. And the shit part is I can't even tell anyone about it. Forget talking to my therapist, she'd have me locked up and the key thrown away if I attempted to unload any of my problems and experiences. After all, who would believe anyone who said they were involved in a murderous power-grab between witches, vampires, werewolves and other supernatural races?\n\n\nNot one damn person, that's who.\n\nBut if I don't get this off my chest, I might lock me up and throw away the key. If only not to get killed by something that doesn't have a box next to it on a coroner's report.\n\nIt all started a few months back, while I was waiting tables at the Whistle Stop. The Whistle is a small little restaurant in Glendale, Kentucky that serves up the best southern dishes and desserts in the area. Folks travel everywhere from Louisville to out of state, and I've even served folks from as far away as Cali and Alaska. We have many regulars, but it's not uncommon to see strange folks here, even if Glendale is literally a one-stop-sign kinda place.\n\nThe two women at table ten made me strangely uneasy from the beginning, requesting a table as far away from any of the others as possible. When Hailey, the hostess, sat them at table ten , I felt an inside groan. Table ten- the haunted table. Not that anyone had actually seen a ghost, but unexplainable things always seem to happen there. Drinks will unexplainably topple over or dishes will slip out of even the most experienced servers' hands. No matter who is sitting at table ten, you just know something is going to happen.\n\nI smiled my most winning smile at the two ladies. One of the women looked to be in her mid-thirties, with dark hair and eyes. She was well-dressed in a pair of slacks with a form-fitting shirt that made it clear she was in excellent shape, and a jacket that matched her sensibly-low heels. In short, she was dressed like Beckett in an episode of Castle, or any other female cop in a prime-time, murder-porn TV show.\n\nThe other looked to be in her mid-twenties, with long, wild sandy blonde hair that fell in waves past her shoulders. It looked like it had not been brushed in several days. She was wearing faded jeans and sneakers, and a faded black Realtree sweatshirt with cammo lettering.\n\nIn short, these women could not have appeared less likely to be dining together. But whatever. I'm not here to ask questions, right?\n\nThe well-dressed woman said she had eaten earlier and simply ordered water with a slight English accent. The younger woman ordered country-style steak, two orders of fried chicken, and two slices of Kentucky pie. I wondered how someone could possibly put away that much food , but hey… big bill, big tip. Who am I to question? Maybe she had a tapeworm.\n\nI had just finished scrubbing the tea urns after promising my manager Tess that I would lock up. The women were the last two people other than myself in the building and I had already cleared the dishes and was waiting for them to pay and leave. I finished closing work in the kitchen and headed out the back door that lead to the dining area and around to the front of the building to check that the lights were off. I was about to round the corner into their section when I first caught wind of their conversation . I should have just delivered the bill and minded my own fucking business. But I've never been good at being sensible. I slipped silently into the next dining room area to listen as pieces of their conversation floated towards me.\n\n\"….. Can't kill him, he holds too much power…\"\n\n\"Even the witches would not dare .\"\n\n\"….Can't control the pack for much longer.\"\n\n\"Vampires have not had a council outside what the Vatican controls in centuries,\"\n\nWhat the fuck? Murder? Witches? Vampires in the Vatican?\n\nActually having been raised Catholic, that last part I could believe.\n\nI was still hiding in the next dining room when they went silent. Could they hear me? Did they know I was back there? I crawled my way to the doorway that connected the two dining room, hoping to covertly peek around the corner. I prayed the damn ancient saloon-style double doors wouldn't squeak too much when I opened them. Then again, I wasn't exactly able crawl all that silently, either. The building is over 120 years old and has all the original flooring. It groans and squeaks with just about every movement. I cursed all the times I chose tacos over going to the gym as I gingerly tried to make my way to the doors.\n\nWhen I got there, I decided not to risk trying to open the doors. Instead, I stuck my head under them only far enough to look under the booths to double check that the two ladies were still there. I briefly praised my own foresight in having already throughly swept and mopped the floor. Maybe Grandpa's half-eaten biscuits and gravy wouldn't end up in my hair.\n\nTable ten was empty.\n\nI was so shocked I went to stand up so quickly I forgot I was under the doors, and cracked my head. I rubbed the rising knot on my scalp and looked around, but there was no sign of the two women. I rushed around the restaurant seeing if maybe they had gone to use the restroom before paying their bill. No dice. I even checked the kitchen. Nothing.\n\nI heaved a sigh. Great. Now not only am I the last one here, my last table was two crazy ladies who dined and dashed on me. Assholes.\n\nI finished my last duties and stepped out the back door into the cool autumn evening. We were already busy when I arrived at work earlier, so I had to park clear down Railroad Avenue , and I had a fairly long walk in the dark ahead of me. The streetlights had gone out a while back but Glendale prides itself on being a \"community\" rather than an actual town. The result was nobody had gotten around to fixing the lights. The median age of the residents being somewhere between 75 and death, everyone was well inside and likely already asleep by the time dark fell. Fixing the streetlights wasn't on anyone's priority list.\n\nI walked past the antique mall and shuddered at the eerie sight of porcelain dolls staring at me in the darkened window display. As I walked down Railroad the houses stopped and there was nothing but cornfield on either side of the little road. I always hate walking by myself simply because it always feels as if someone, something is out there. This night was no different and I tried to walk faster but I could not shake the feeling that I was being watched. Stalked.\n\nWhen I finally reached my car my hands were clammy and shaking as I dug around my purse for my key fob. I heaved a sigh of relief when my hand found the fob, and went to pull it out when a black blur whizzed beside me.\n\nBefore I could blink, I was on my back in a small grassy patch in front of the cornfield, staring into the eyes of the English-accented well-dressed woman. I gasped for breath, the force of her take-down having knocked the wind out of me. I stared into her eyes, continuing to gasp for breath and not piss myself. Her eyes seemed different. Feral. They caught and reflected the moonlight the way animals' eyes do. She bared her teeth at me, revealing canine teeth that were… well, canine-like. It was like staring into the face of someone who had just stepped away from filming a scene for True Blood. I mentally counted down the weeks until Halloween. It seemed far too early to be attending a Halloween costume party.\n\nIt sounded like someone else's voice as I gasped out \"wha..wha..what do you want?!\"\n\nI had hoped to sound defiant. Fearless. Instead, I sounded like an asthmatic mouse with an anxiety disorder. Fabulous.\n\n\"What did you hear?\" Her voice sounded like a growl.\n\n\"Huh? N-n-nothing!\" I squeaked.\n\n\"Bollocks. I can smell the lies on you. Now is not the time to bullshit. I have other ways of getting the truth from you.\" Shit. I'm gonna die.\n\nThe younger woman's face suddenly loomed over me. She spoke with a thick southern accent, but it wasn't local. \"Just kill her and let's go before one of these blue hairs decides to talk a late-night stroll. We have to get going. This little bitch isn't going to fuck up us finding my father or talk shit to the wrong people. She's a loose end. Get rid of her.\"\n\nI started to scream, hoping one of \"those blue hairs\" would actually be on a stroll, but the well-dressed woman quickly put her hand over my mouth. She looked up at the younger woman and sneered. \"Bloodshed isn't necessary here. This one might be useful. If nothing else, she might know something.\" She looked down at me. \" I suggest you stay quiet. I may be reasonable but my associate here would rip your throat out with her teeth and not think twice. She's rather rash, that one. So be a good girl, hmmm? Now, look at me.\"\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut. I didn't want to look into those strange, feral eyes. She shook me hard.\n\n\"Look at me or I swear, they'll never find what's left of you. Genevieve? Perhaps you might emphasize my point? Let's let our little waitress know this is no idle threat.\"\n\nMy eyes were still glued shut when I heard what sounded like the growl of a very large animal. It was deeper and more menacing than any animal I had ever encountered. At the sound of it my eyes snapped open. The well-dressed woman smiled, revealing those horribly pointed teeth.\n\n\"Very good. Now, look at me.There's a good girl.\"\n\nI stared into those fearsome, strange eyes and they seemed to start to glow. I felt myself become strangely calm. The glow of her eyes seemed to intensify, and I felt my body becoming heavy. I felt myself falling…falling. I was falling into blackness when I heard her faintly say \"Good. Now we are going go for a bit of a ride…..\"\n\nThe world went black.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Confusion and panic battled within me as I felt a sharp pain in my head, like someone had taken a sharp object and made a tiny hole in my skull.\n\nAs my eyes adjusted to the low light, I saw I was in a small, damp, stone-walled room. It looked like a tiny cell. There were no windows and the only light came from a small, flickering torch on the wall. The air was musty and smelled of decay and old wood. I tried to sit up but the room started to spin, making me feel nauseous.\n\n\"Welcome to your accommodations,\" a voice said from the shadows.\n\nI turned to see the well-dressed woman, the English accent clear and sharp in the stillness of the room. She stepped into the light and I could see she still had her eyes glowing in the dimness. She was looking at me with an unreadable expression, not revealing much of what she was thinking.\n\n\"Who... who are you?\" I stuttered, trying to keep my voice steady despite the fear inside me. \n\n\"Let's say I'm an old acquaintance,\" she replied with a sarcastic grin. \"And it appears you're now a guest in my house. You were very wise not to scream when you last saw me. Had you screamed, I'm afraid I would have been forced to remove you from the equation quickly and quietly. But instead, you were spared.\"\n\n\"You're a... you're a witch?\" I asked, but even to me, the words sounded foolish and naïve in that dark, eerie place.\n\nShe laughed softly, a sound that seemed to wrap around me and chill my bones. \"Oh, you're sharp, aren't you? But you don't know the half of it. I'm much more than a witch, and I have a feeling you're going to find out just how much. And then, perhaps, you'll be willing to help me.\"\n\n\"Help you do what?\" I managed to ask, my voice trembling. \n\n\"Let's just say you might have a chance to make things right. But first,\" she said, stepping closer to me with a small, silver-looking object in her hand, \"we need to have a little chat. This,\" she held up the object, \"is a truth wand. And trust me, it'll tell me everything I need to know.\"\n\n\"It's a truth potion,\" I said, recognizing the shiny, silver object.\n\nShe smirked and nodded. \"Very good. And I must say, I'm impressed. But enough chit-chat. Drink.\"\n\nShe moved closer and waved the truth potion in front of me. I could feel my mouth drying up, and my throat closing. I knew that I didn't have a choice. With a shaking hand, I took the truth potion and swallowed it.\n\nAs the truth potion took effect, a wave of dizziness washed over me and I had to fight to stay conscious.\n\n\"What did you hear at the Whistle Stop?\" she asked me, her voice stern and commanding.\n\n\"Everything,\" I replied. \"You were talking about killing someone, about witches and vampires and pack. I heard it all.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, her eyes glinting. \"And do you know why we need you?\"\n\nI shook my head, my mouth dry and my throat parched. \"No.\"\n\n\"We need you to find someone for us,\" she said. \"You're going to help us find a certain... individual. Someone who has information about something very important.\"\n\n\"Why should I help you?\" I asked, desperation in my voice.\n\n\"Because if you don't, you'll never make it out of here alive,\" she said, her voice cold and emotionless. \"We're not the only things lurking in the night, you know. There are others out there who would kill you without a second thought.\"\n\nI nodded, understanding that I was in a dangerous situation and that my survival depended on doing whatever these strange, supernatural creatures asked of me.\n\n\"You must understand that this is a world you were not meant to know about,\" she continued. \"But now that you do, you have a choice. You can either help us, or... you can join us.\"\n\n\"Join you?\" I asked, puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, join us. You can become one of us. You can become a witch, a vampire, a werewolf, or anything else you desire. The power, the freedom, the excitement... it's all yours if you choose to join us. But first, you must help us find this individual.\"\n\nI looked at her, my mind racing. The idea of becoming a supernatural being, of having power and immortality, was incredibly tempting. But at the same time, I couldn't help but think of the dangers, the risks, the unknown consequences.\n\n\"I'll help you find this person,\" I said, making my decision. \"But I want to know more about this world first. I want to understand what I'm getting into.\"\n\nShe nodded, satisfied. \"Very well. But remember, once you've taken the potion, there's no going back.\"\n\nWith that, she pulled out a small vial of silver liquid and handed it to me. \"Drink this, and you'll become one of us. But first, you must help us find the person we're looking for.\"\n\nI took the vial, feeling its cold, smooth surface in my hand. I knew this decision could change my life forever, but I also knew that I had no choice. I had to do this to survive. With a deep breath, I took the potion and swallowed it.\n\nAs the liquid coursed through my veins, I felt a rush of power, a surge of energy, a sense of freedom that I had never felt before. I was now a part of this world, a part of something bigger than myself. And I knew that my life was about to change forever.\n\nAs the potion took effect, I felt a strange sense of calm and focus. I knew that I had made the right decision, that I was ready for whatever was coming next. I was ready to become a part of this supernatural world and to help these strange, powerful creatures in their quest to find the person they were looking for.\n\nBut I also knew that this world was dangerous, that there were things out there that I didn't understand yet. I knew that I would have to be careful, that I would have to learn quickly if I wanted to survive.\n\nBut for now, I was ready. I was ready to become one of them, to join this world of witches, vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural creatures. And I was ready to help them find the person they were looking for. Because I knew that this was my chance to be something more, to be something Different. And I wasn't going to let it slip away.\n\nAnd so, with my newfound powers and my newfound sense of purpose, I set out to help these strange, supernatural creatures in their quest to find the person they were looking for. And I knew that my life was about to take a turn that I had never expected. But I was ready for it.

{"id": "text_completion_020", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: No one I\"ve come across in my travels know as to how the curse our world has been given was triggered. What I do know is that we are born with this sickness. This sickness is onset with prolonged sleep. Slowly but consistently it eats away at the mind of the individual leading to an ultimate state of insanity. The result is a mindless, caricature of a former life.\n\n\nThe sickness only occurs with humans, at the very least I\"ve never seen an animal like them. They show no interest in animal life and occupy their time with the chaotic desire to kill and consume humans. They are especially effective at this. It must have been a lifetime ago since I had the pleasure of conversation with another.\n\nTruth be told, it was a lifetime away.\n\nI was imprisoned at the Fort Briggs; at least this was what the guard told me. I don\"t remember what caused me to be imprisoned or anything beforehand-not sure why. In any event I awoke to a soldier looming over me. The surprise almost caused me to swiftly get to an upright position to greet my company but something in his eyes sent a chill to my heart as if the spear he was also carrying had already impaled my heart. But no, he only sat there resting against the cell, looking not so much at me as in me. It was like my soul was stripped naked and studied, his sunken glare penetrating its very depth.\n\n\"Well you\"re not one of them, yet anyway. I\"m no murderer but perhaps a fool. I couldn\"t bring it upon myself to pierce your heart as you slept. I\"ve seen the signs though. The cold sweats, the fear, and then nothing. Or at least for a few moments; they finally awake and it\"s done. They just start killing and...\"\n\nHis voice trailed off as he dropped his head. At this point I was upright but I hadn\"t made any sudden movements. I have never met a distraught man but this seems like the situation.\n\nBut as if possessed he jumped up and whispered,\n\n\"They eat us! I-I\"ve seen it!\"\n\nThe dread and repulsion present in his voice was now gone and he returned to his initial position.\n\n\"We all knew that sleep causes it, and we fought it off for as long as we could. At last, not all of us had the same resolve. It was a recruit, a young lad who\"ve never seen a battle or felt a woman\"s warmth. He thought it a good notion to rest his eyes while on guard duty. When they found him, he attacked one of us in the most vicious manner I have ever seen. To think a boy could rip a grown man\"s throat asunder! They were able to hack his head off but it wasn\"t long before more and more of us started to drop. It\"s when you go without sleep that you truly realize how precious the comfort of it is. And so, I\"m all that\"s left. My brothers-in-arms have all given in. Out of fear of them I protected myself in this cell, only to discover you. \"\n\nAfterwards he became quiet, as if he had been waiting endlessly to have someone to speak to. Assuming he was waiting for my retort to this I probed him on my location and such details.\n\n\"This is Fort Briggs; you are rather deep in the northern region of Iscariot. I couldn\"t tell you why you are here but you have surely been blessed by Tali. There is no one left out there, just them.\"\n\nIscariot is the \"land of blood\" as it\"s known. It has conquered several nations; it was thought that the Gods themselves had chosen for Iscariot to rule over all. Fort Briggs is a colossal structure that was created by the now vanished Titans. It occupies a small fissure between two steep highlands, making it the only plausible way to enter Iscariot land from the north. He referred to the Goddess Tali, which is an interesting note as Tali is not worshipped in Iscariot but in Ishla; a country mostly comprised of desert and chasms.\n\nI was so occupied in my thoughts that I didn\"t notice the sound of something approaching. The soldier was more alert and gestured for me to remain still and silent. The sound of iron boots grew steadily louder and louder as if it was ensnaring us, trapping us. And as gradually as it appeared, the steps began to drift off-but never did it go away. I never saw anyone but I did notice the soldier. It was if Death itself had gently brushed pass him, taking both his skin color and calm demeanor. I questioned the fear stricken man about what it was.\n\n\"Them.\"\n\nIt was clear that he was on the verge of insanity. I wouldn\"t blame the poor soul. If he has indeed gone some stretched period without sleep then his state of mind has surely been warped. Seeing this it created an instinctive fear in me. I did not intend to wait in this cell for starvation or madness to overtake me. I made my way towards the cell door, but in a sudden moment the soldier had pointed his spear at me. Those cold, merciless eyes had returned but now with a glint of murderous intent.\n\n\"I empathize with you. I too have pondered the prospect of escape from this cell, to fight my way out of the Fort and so on and so forth. No one desires to experience the humility of being a caged animal but this is how it is. To leave this cell, this haven, would result only in a gruesome death.\"\n\nThis man has truly given in to fear and has lost hope of escaping our hell. Not deterred I made my intentions clear to him of me finding my own way out, with or without him.\n\n\"You will forgive me then. I have known you for a few moments but in those you have made me think you a sensible person. However, I won\"t allow you to potentially jeopardize me! If they find you, then they\"ll find me and I intend to go on with the rest of my days.\n\nI\"m sorry friend.\"\n\nBefore I had time to respond the soldier lunged his spear towards me. Perhaps Tali is watching after me as the spear struck just under my right arm and collided with the stone wall. The resulting jolt caused the soldier to drop the spear at which I tackled him. I had never been in a situation like this, where I had to fight for my life. We both desperately grasped for each other\"s neck while rolling to and fro. I saw the veins rise in his face and his eyes bulge and turn bloodshot. I felt the heat of his skin against mine and the throbbing of his pulse.\n\nI was going to die.\n\nThe soldier had obviously been trained to kill and was quite stronger than me and I gradually loosened my grip until he was on top of me and was I was near done for. It was during this I noticed his spear just within reach. With a stretch for life I snatched the weapon and struck him across the face. He stumbled over and grasped his bleeding ear. Not waiting for him to recover I attacked. It wasn\"t so much intentional as my body just knew what it had to do. His iron armor covered most of his body so I gouged his face over and over. The squishy noise of each strike felt dark yet consoling and I continued. Blood and other stuff peppered over my face, while his was a red unidentifiable mass-and yet I continued.\n\nEventually I regained my composure and disgusted at myself I dropped the spear and sat against the opposing wall. It is one thing to hear about people being killed and dying but this was up close and personal. It was a rush at first but now a sober cold sensation remained. I forced myself not to think about what had just transpired. I needed to escape. After searching his body, I did not find a key to the padlock. A few hours went by as I tried to formulate another plan. It was during this I noticed the sound of water running. It grew louder near the rear wall, and upon closer inspection I noticed the water was running from beneath the stone floor. It was cracked in several sections and the thought of breaking open a hole could be possible with the spear. So I enveloped myself in this endeavor, quietly but slowly as not to draw the attention of whatever they are.\n\nOver the course of what was likely several hours I was able to create a big enough hole to at the very least see what lied beneath. It seemed like a sewer of some sort but it was an escape. With the hole open, I only had to chip away at the sides and rather rapidly in contrast to my initial progress it grew to I was able to squeeze through. However the thought occurred to me that I may have to fight my way out and if so I could make better use of the corpse\"s armor than he did. It wasn\"t as heavy as I thought it would be but the added size required I expand the hole more.\n\nI found myself now in a dark sewer like burrow. It was too dark to see what I was stepping in but I tried not to think about it nonetheless. Treading the thick liquid in full armor was not pleasant. Mounted in a corner was a torch which I carried with me as I cautiously made my way through the ever-curving tunnel. I had to hold the spear in one hand and its weight became more noticeable. Its tip was also twisted and rounded from it being used to break through the floor.\n\nEventually I came across a metal ladder to a manhole. Holding the torch in one hand, the spear in my mouth I climbed the ladder but found that the manhole was exceedingly heavy. Again, the spear was used to break it lose and I was able to crack it open and subsequently open to reveal a grey sky. I then remembered the northern region of Iscariot is consistently cold, with snow falling year-round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I saw them.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "A chilling wind swept across the barren landscape as I lifted myself out of the manhole, the spear still clenched between my teeth. The grey sky loomed overhead, pregnant with a promise of snow that hung in the air like a silent threat. The fort, with its stark lines and ominous presence, seemed to recede into the distance behind me as I surveyed my new surroundings. \n\nThe curse was alive in the desolation of the northern region of Iscariot. The snow blanketed the land in silent white, broken only by the occasional blackened tree, stripped of hope and life by the relentless frost. The land itself bore the scars of the curse, the rawness of a world on the brink of perpetual darkness.\n\nMy breath came in ragged gasps, each cloud of mist a temporary respite against the frigid air. The fort's walls loomed in the distance like an unforgiving god, casting a long shadow over the land. I knew I couldn't go back; the fort was a prison of the mind as much as it was of the body. The curse took those who could not escape it, turning them into the very demons they feared.\n\nDressed in the soldier's armor, I moved with a cautious grace, the spear's weight a constant reminder of the battles I'd fought—both seen and unseen. The land was eerie, lifeless, and yet there was something alive in the silence. The curse was like a specter, always lurking just at the edge of perception, waiting for its next victim.\n\nAs I trudged through the snow, my boots sinking with each step, I could feel the eyes of the land upon me—watchful, calculating. It was as if the very land itself was suffused with the curse, every snowflake a whisper of the madness that lay in wait.\n\nI came across the first of the creatures just as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the snow in hues of blood. They moved like wraiths, their forms twisted and grotesque, eyes devoid of humanity. They were the embodiment of the curse, creatures born from the minds of those the sickness consumed.\n\nThe fight was brutal, a dance of life and death in the snowy wastes. The spear, once a tool of protection, became a instrument of vengeance. Each strike was a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, the refusal to succumb to the madness that sought to consume it. \n\nBut there was something else in my fight—a realization that perhaps the curse was not without its purpose. It was as if the world itself was purging itself, weeding out the weak, the consumed, leaving only those who could fight against the darkness.\n\nAs the night enveloped me, I stood amidst the fallen, a solitary figure against the backdrop of the snowy waste. The curse had marked me, but it had also given me a purpose—to survive, to fight against the madness that threatened to consume the world.\n\nThe snow continued to fall, a silent whisper of the future. I knew I could not fight the curse alone, but perhaps, somewhere out there, others had fought and survived, carrying the flame of resistance in their hearts. Together, we could fight against the darkness, carve out a new path in the land of blood.\n\nWith each step, I felt the weight of the curse lift slightly. The land of Iscariot was a battleground, but within its desolation lay the seeds of hope. The curse had marked me, but it had also given me the strength to fight back, to find a way to avert the darkness that threatened to consume us all.\n\nAnd so, I moved forward, into the heart of the storm, a beacon of defiance against the insanity that sought to claim the world. The curse was a trial, a test of the spirit, but within me burned the undying flame of humanity—a light that would never extinguish, no matter the darkness that sought to consume it.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_021", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Whatever you do, be aware of your surroundings. Be aware of everything. Capture every motion, whether you use your brain or you phone. Capture. Every. Single. Detail. You are in a new world, you are disoriented, you don't know where to go. Just use this guide, and you'll be fine.\n\n\nI am here for some time, let's say about three months. I have already experienced that there are no humans, as far as I know. We are in a dystopia, and your main goal is to survive. That's why I requested you to capture everything, this can be proof later on that this world exists.\n\nAlso, there are just a few animals. Only some birds and not many other species. There are so called '*Crytids'.* These are the monsters of this planet, and to kill them you need to use your machete and stab in its eye. They are two feet high and their eyes are on top of their heads. It's easy visible because the head is just at the top of its body. But watch out, they are really fast, approximately they run at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The reason they can achieve such high speeds is because they run at all fours, excluding one weird limb at the back of them. It looks like a leg but is probably useless. They look just a slightly bit like a dog, so don't mistake a Crytid with a dog. Because we have Crytids, but no dogs.\n\nThe way to recognize those bastards is because your arms are going to tingle, which is an inevitable and undeniable feeling. Your surroundings will all suddenly go quiet. This is the most obvious sound a Crytid is near. So be aware of those things. Have your machete ready and prepare for a fight.\n\nIn this world there are a ton of Crytids, unfortunate for us. The first encounter with such a thing is often incredibly scary. But whenever you have fought with a couple of them, they will be easier to conquer and also easier to recognize when one of them is nearby.\n\nSorry, almost forgot to mention that they aim for your weak parts. In this case they aim for your legs. They do this so you can't walk and thus will be an easier target for them because you won't be bigger. When a Crytid is going to attack you, make sure to be fast with your feet. And of course your machete.\n\nThe goal why you are put into this world is a mystery for me either. I don't have a specific answer to a question so diverse. The most likely answer would be that you have been a naughty boy, a very naughty boy. Nah, jokes aside. This might've been a punishment because you were a bad guy in your previous world. Probably planet Earth, which was in my case.\n\nHowever, I have no clue why I have been banned to this planet. Perhaps God thought it might be fun for me to give me a more challenging life, in which he sure accomplished. Although I am missing my friends and family at this point. I might know how to escape this world, but I am not sure.\n\nEvery. Single. Thing. Might not even be real. You simply don't know what is and what is not. But to escape this world, I need a partner. So if you have received this letter, you know what is waiting for you. My name is Blade. When we meet you can recognize me by my red baseball hat, and black protection gear. If you can't immediately see me, everywhere I go I put on the roof a tiny orange flag. I do this to know to which places I've been and which places are prohibited by me.\n\nThere are, nonetheless this is a really weird world, a couple of important buildings;\n\n\\- Head Building of Destruction. This used to be an office for guns. Whether it be the manufacture or testing of guns; you can name it all. It's a big building which is approx. 30 feet high and 25 feet wide. This building is easily recognizable by its American flag at the front side. (I have no idea why the American flag but whatever). The office also has a gun painted on the roof, so from the top view you can also see it. The building overall is like a giant box, with black painted walls from the outside. It has 6 feet high windows at the front side which gives you a clear view of what is inside. I recommend if you see the Head Building of Destruction that you go inside if the coast is clear and get yourself a better battle weapon. Like a semi-automatic weapon is good but a couple of knives are great, too. It's up to you. But keep this building in mind because there sure will be some weapons inside which can be optimal in a fight against Crytids.\n\n\\- Personal Supermarket. This is just a small 40 by 40 feet supermarket which offers the essential products to survive in this world. Like water, bread, rice et cetera. This is also good to check-out when you see it. The Personal Supermarket has its name in red letters in front of a green square. It has two lampposts at the side of it, in which the electricity has already ran out.\n\n\\- Crytid's Cave. Like the name already says, this is the cave of all the Crytids. Stay at all cost, away from it. If, however, just one Crytid notices you, they all come for you. The Crytid's cave is a really big cave on a huge hill. This hill lays in a desert and is easy noticeable from a pretty far distance. I had to run for my life one time, so I recommend you shouldn't go there.\n\n\\- Centre of Everything. This is the centre of this place, and is a hotspot for Crytids, so if you are going to this place, make sure you have your machete ready. Otherwise, don't go to this place if you are not ready to battle. I have been to here one time, and it's pretty impressive, so you'd be better off to stay away.\n\n\\- The Point. This is the place where you woke up. It's a meeting point for all the people that escaped this place and is easy visible because it has a sign which says; \"This is where the end has started\". I know this, because people have led me to it, but I couldn't go yet. This is an important place to meet someone, so keep that in mind.\n\nHopefully this guide helped you a bit, if you find this letter, meet me tomorrow at The Point. Right when the sun rises. You can recognize me by my red baseball hat and black protection gear. I'll wait for you.\n\nRegards, Blade.\n\n\n\n'Wow' I said, 'That was an intense guide and invitation to this world!'. I sighed, 'But I am really curious who this Blade guy is, he seems cool.' I said to myself. Right as I wanted to explore my surroundings a bit, my arm began tingling. I remember what Blade said; *The way to recognize those bastards is because your arms are going to tingle, which is an inevitable and undeniable feeling.* So I knew there was a Crytid lurking at me. I quickly searched for my machete, which was in my backpack next to me. I got it and silently waited for it. Within a split second it sprinted to me. I was scared but aimed for the eye, it aimed for my leg. I stabbed as hard as I could and I was unbelievably scared. But after one stab in its eye, it fell down on the ground, obviously dead. 'Pfew, that was close and scary', I said, 'but oh man, it felt so good.'\n\nWith my machete in my pocket and the disoriented feeling fading away, I started to explore my surroundings a bit, waiting for the sun to go under and rise again, so I could meet Blade.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "As dawn approached, the horizon began to glow with hues of orange, pink, and gold. The sunrise was a spectacle that reminded me of Earth, which seemed so distant now. I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation for meeting Blade, this character from my instructions, which seemed both mysterious and potentially helpful.\n\nThe Point where I woke up was indeed an area of significance, as the sign proclaimed. It had been deserted when I arrived, but now, as the sun crested the horizon, others started to gather. They were survivors like myself, each carrying their own stories and scars. Some were in groups, sharing equipment and strategies, while others were solitary, carrying their gear as if ready to face the world alone. All of them, though, shared one common goal: survival.\n\nI noticed someone wearing a red baseball cap and black protective gear, just as described. It was Blade. He was slightly taller than average, with a strong build and an air of confidence. His eyes seemed to take in everything at once, missing no detail. As he caught my gaze, he gave a brief nod and motioned me over.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said in a deep, commanding voice. \"You must be the new arrival. I'm Blade.\"\n\nI introduced myself, noticing that he carried a similar machete to the one I had used to kill my first Crytid. He seemed pleased that I had survived my initial encounter with one of those creatures.\n\n\"My name is Alex,\" I replied, extending my hand. He shook it firmly, his grip strong but not overpowering.\n\n\"So, you've killed a Crytid already?\" he asked. I nodded and shared the tale of my close call with the creature. Blade listened intently, occasionally offering advice on how to improve my technique or how to anticipate the creatures' moves better.\n\n\"You did well,\" he said, a rare smile breaking across his face. \"But this world is full of dangers. We need to be prepared for anything.\"\n\nHe then led me to a nearby structure that he called the Head Building of Destruction. The building was indeed a giant box with a painted gun on the roof and an American flag at the front. It was surreal, like something from a dystopian movie. Blade produced a key from his pocket and unlocked the door.\n\nInside, the building was a treasure trove of weapons and ammunition. There were guns of all sizes, from handguns to rifles, as well as a variety of melee weapons, including machetes and knives. Blade explained that this was a stockpile that he and others had built up over time, using whatever they could find or create.\n\n\"We need to arm ourselves for when we face the Crytids,\" he said. \"And also for any other dangers that might lurk in this world.\"\n\nWe spent the next few hours equipping ourselves, choosing reliable weapons and ensuring we had enough ammunition. Blade showed me how to maintain and clean my chosen firearms, stressing the importance of keeping them in good working order. As we worked, he shared more about his experiences in this world and his theories on how to escape.\n\n\"I believe there's a way to leave this place,\" he said, his voice low and serious. \"But it's going to take all of us working together, and we need to be better prepared than ever. The Crytids are just the beginning. There are other things out there, things that are even worse.\"\n\nAs the day unfolded, more survivors arrived at The Point. Blade introduced me to them, each with their own unique backgrounds and skills. Some were seasoned veterans of this world, while others were like me, trying to find their footing in a place that seemed designed to test the limits of human endurance and spirit.\n\nWe formed a small community, pooling our resources and knowledge to improve our chances of survival. We set up a rotating watch system to keep an eye out for Crytids and other threats. We collected food and water from the Personal Supermarket, being careful to avoid the Crytid's Cave and the Centre of Everything.\n\nDespite the danger and the unknown, there was a sense of camaraderie that developed among us. We shared meals, traded stories, and strategized for our eventual escape. Blade was our leader, guiding us with his experience and calm demeanor, but he always emphasized the importance of teamwork and mutual support.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, we grew stronger, both physically and mentally. We faced more Crytids and other challenges, but each time we emerged more confident and more capable. The bonds we formed were strong, built on shared hardships and a common goal.\n\nAnd through it all, Blade never lost his determination to find a way out of this world. He believed, as I did now, that we could overcome any obstacle if we worked together. Our journey was far from over, but with each passing day, we were one step closer to finding our way back to the world we once knew.\n\nAs the sun set on another day in this dystopian world, we gathered at The Point, sharing a meal and talking about our hopes for the future. Blade stood at the center, his red baseball cap a beacon of hope in the fading light.\n\n\"We will find a way out of this,\" he said, his voice firm and resolute. \"And when we do, we'll take this world's lessons with us, stronger and more united than ever.\"\n\nAnd with that, we settled in for the night, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, knowing that together, we could overcome anything.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, and tone.

{"id": "text_completion_022", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: The look in each of their eyes was enough. It stopped me, as it would any other, in my tracks. The look of pure terror, tears streaming from their eyes. \"no, please stop.\" \"take whatever it is you want!\" These were words I had never expected to hear, not even in the darkest of circumstances. Too little too late, I assume. After all, we are in this situation, regardless of what I grew to expect over the last few years.\n\n\nThe room, although covered in light from an old 1990's style ceiling fan, a lamp in the two corners on either side of a work desk that sit just across the room from a couch and loveseat set up, covered in clutter and the computer monitor dancing in bubbles and more light, had seemed dark. Perhaps it was in the air, for I had not come here with girl scout cookies and a young adorable smile. No. I had come here to get the truth out in the open finally.\n\nA year of absolute terror and sadness, as I tracked down my mothers murderer. Following him in secret, lurking behind bushes and following behind his vehicle. The moment is finally here, and his secrets will be revealed.\n\nI asked myself many times already how this man could be the monster he is and still lead a normal life, fathering three children and pretending to be this amazing husband. Grocery shopping, soccer games and cookouts. How in the hell did he manage his time so well, and continue doing what he does in the shadows of night.\n\nLooking down, ignoring the family that are sat around me, bound to each of their own chairs I managed to collect from the dining room table. Five seats lay before me, forming a diamond around the empty chair in the center. This chair is taken though, we just sit in wait for the man of the house. The monster.\n\nMaybe I am getting ahead of myself though. My name. well, this bit is irrelevant to my story, and the end isn't as important but by now you have to be wondering about the little things. Such as, my name, why I am sharing my story with you and who the hell I think I am to tell such a story in the first place. Like I said, I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nWhere was I? oh, yeah, my name. as irrelevant a piece it is, I'll allow you to call me Shadow. I am 19 years old and 2 years ago I found my mother. She had been brutally murdered and no, that Is not an understatement nor is it exaggerated because I am her child. She had been tortured for hours, her face had been swollen from the apparent beatings she suffered. Her stomach had been enlarged where the sick bastard had put the end of a fire exterminater hose into her mouth and hit the trigger. Her eyes were sank in, it had been apparent almost immediately that she had been crying in her last hours, and not because her favorite show was cancelled. The cuts all over her body, where she had been stripped and savagely handled and raped. The sight was ghastly, haunting me at every turn, whenever I found myself asleep or even simply blinking.\n\nThere was no real reason for what happened to her, other than the fact that she had been home and female. This is a fact I came to find after the first six months, studying the other murder/rapes that fit the same M/O.\n\nThe first clue I found was that they had all seemed to follow the sewage system, allowing me to track his next victim, where I learned his identity. My first instinct was to call the police, but by the time I found him, it had been to late. I barely saw his face as he drove past me, but the car screamed at me, for whatever reason. I wrote down his license plate number and using a friends father, I found out who it belonged to. Of course at this time, I had barely any faith that he was my guy, but sure enough.\n\nI found his address and began following him. He was originally using the sewer to track attractive woman and within two weeks they would fall victim to him. Of course, I know you might be wondering why I did not stop him, turn him in or do anything but follow him. Truth is, I was angry, and I wanted others too suffer. Want him off this earth as bad as I had grown too.\n\nTruth is, I wanted too understand him. Why is he doing these things? Why did he feel he had any right to take my mother from me? I lost my father to a drunk driver, hit and run. Imagine my surprise when I found that the drunk driver had been this asshole I spent so much time following. I practically lived in my own car, tracking the pricks every move.\n\nIt was impressive, after each day of work, he would crawl into the sewer at work and begin his hunt. Tracking down a new victim and after he found them, he would get this smile on his face. Bingo. That was my cue. Thirteen more woman after my mother, and guess where he is at the moment I stand at the center of his living room with his family. Victim number fourteen.\n\nI realize at this point, I am no longer any better than him. If ever I was, that day was too long ago to even try to remember or even much think about it. Anyhow, again, I find myself going all over the place.\n\nSo here I stand, the center of attention, if it weren't for the blindfolds covering their eyes. Interesting enough, I got to learn a lot about these four as well, following their father, or husband. I made it a point to write down the point of tonight on the massive blackboard I stole from the school down the street.\n\nThe Truth Will Set You Free.\n\nThe fact of the matter, standing here, I had no idea how exactly the night before me would play out. Ignoring their cries was beginning to get further and further from impossible. \"please let the kids go!\" the mother of three screamed, \"I will do whatever you want, just please. Please let them go.\"\n\n\"oh, sweetheart. If your husband does the right thing, nobody has to get hurt at all.\" I spoke softly, hoping that those words would be more than enough to calm her but as I feared. It had not been enough.\n\n\"why are you doing this!\" she screamed, causing a further riot from the other three. Directly in front of the middle chair sat the wife, so that they could be face to face during the nights events. At his left side Sat his oldest child. A daughter of 16, they must have named under intoxication. Personal opinion aside though, Winter. At his right side, his 13 year old son, Benjamin and behind him, the child that he had allowed to grow so spoiled that he actually fought against my hooded figure, holding a gun to his face. Unloaded or not, an unintelligent choice. Victor.\n\n\"shut the Hell up!\" I screamed, setting down the mobile plastic table for my recent collection of tools. \"the next person to make a fuckin' sound will lose a finger!\" the words, as empty a threat as it had been, were more than enough to calm them down a little.\n\nMy work here was almost done, as I sat my tools on the table and began separating them out on the table. Truth be told, I had no idea where this night was going to go and believe me, I also had no idea how far I was willing to go.\n\nThe truth had to be told though, these people deserved to know the truth about the monster they allowed to lead the family. It took me three months to discover enough about him to truly start my portfolio. His name threw me off the most, it was the name of a real family man, one without the kind of secrets this monster had. Kenny Churkle. What a fucking name.\n\nThe door slamming outside was the cue I waited for and within seconds, the lights were out, and I hid behind the door that when opened would find it smack in the center of all the delight I had in store. The door opened, and before he knew it I had myself wrapped around his throat and the paper towel over his mouth.\n\n\"the truth will set you free.\" I whispered as he slowly collapsed in my arms.\n\nWhen he came too, he found himself the center of attention. His family around him, eyes no longer covered with the garments of clothes I used to form the blindfolds. The mask I was wearing sat beside my tools, which included a scalpel, buck knife, handsaw, wrench, hammer, nails and a few smaller knives and other odds and in things that within the next few hours might be used to inflict pain.\n\n\"Who the hell are you! What do you want? Why are you doing this?\" he asked so quickly that my head began to spin. He sat there tied up, wearing his suit and tie so well. Working late, was his lie. He had to look the part I assume and this was his idea of doing so.\n\n\"I will ask the questions, but first I will give you one more chance to end it all right now.\" I said, kneeling in front of him so that we were face to face. His eyes lead to the soul and weirdly enough, there had somehow been a light, not even flickering. Fear consuming his body and paving way for tears, shakes and pure anxiety. \"tell them where you were tonight, tell them the truth and I will begin to pack my things and make my way on out the door.\"\n\n\"wh-what the hell are you talking about? What truth!\" he asked, the screams of his family got louder as it appeared they understood a wrong answer was not good. He was better off keeping his mouth shut, and if it hadn't been clear when he spoke the words, when I stood up, finding my hand wrapped around the handle of the hammer and swinging myself around and smacking his wife in the face with the brute blunt flat end of the tool, he found that lying, was not an option.\n\nThe blood rushed from the wound, where the hammer tore a decent hole into her left cheek. \"No! leave them alone!\" he screamed at me, Kenny, how dare he pretend to care. How dare he tell me what to do! Turning back to him, heavy breaths escape between clenched jaw grinding teeth. My eyes slit into narrow pathways that led straight to hell themselves.\n\n\"Do you feel in control of the situation, because you should. All it takes is a few simple sentences. You can start with, I moonlight as a…\" I let the sentence hang between us as his wife came too, slowly lifting her head back up. Must have hurt like hell, because her grunts were awful sounding. The silence hung there for too long. \"wow, you really care that much about keeping your secret, you will let them suffer this way?\"\n\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about,\" he cried at me, sobbing, begging his God to end this and let his family just be free. \"I will give you whatever you want, just please.\" He began to beg, and believe me, my skin began to crawl as his avoiding the truth was becoming more than I could take.\n\n\"LIAR!\" I screamed and as I stood back up he began trying to shake free again, as he had tried first when he came to. \"Fine, if you want to play it this way, Winter, I will allow you to come clean first. Show daddy here what revealing the truth really looks like!\" I spat the words towards her father, lifting the hammer towards his face. \"okay dear.\"\n\n\"leave them out of whatever this is, please. You can keep me, let them go.\" Kenny said, \"just let them go!\" he continued to try and shake free, as if that would change anything. In between work, stalking this monster and sleep, I found time to train in self-defense, karate and a couple other fighting techniques before tonight.\n\n\"so winter,\" I said, finding a smile across my face. \"three months ago, a boy crawled through that window, things happened. Tell everyone here what happened, in explicit detail, if you tell the truth, I will slightly cut your right leg but if you lie, Victor over there, loses his ear.\"\n\n\"wh-what?\" their mother stammered, her eyes were blood shot, and her head sitting back up it revealed her jaw must have been messed up or dislocated. \"she-she nev-never had anyone ove-\"\n\n\"his name is Daniel.\" Winter began, but was quickly cut off by her father. Telling her she doesn't have to play my sick games, that he would deal with me and that I was crazy.\n\n\"not playing the game is Not a goddamn option!\" I screamed, slamming the hammer on the table, shaking the rest of my tools and shutting everyone up again. \"I make the rules and for the love of god, if one more of you mother fuckers even tries to interrupt the process again, with anything other than the goddamn truth, I will fucking kill one of you.\" Not only did the words stop them even further than the hammer crashing into the table, but they scared the hell out of me. I never intended to actually commit a murder tonight but I found that not only was I willing to, but if need be, I was going to…\n\nThe knock on the door changed everything.

I slowly moved towards it, keeping my body low and ready to pounce. The knocking grew more insistent.\n\n\"Who's there?\" I asked, my voice surprisingly steady given the chaos swirling inside my head.\n\n\"It's the cops, we heard a commotion,\" a voice replied, a mixture of concern and authority lacing his words.\n\nI looked back at Kenny and his family. My decision was made - I couldn't let the cops catch me in here, not with the evidence of my crimes so clearly visible. But neither could I leave without getting the truth out of Kenny. I needed something, anything that would make this all worth it.\n\nMaking a split-second decision, I pulled out my phone and quickly filmed Kenny, who was still tied up and looking bewildered. \"Kenny Churkle, you're the one who's been terrorizing the city with these brutal murders and rapes. You've been living a double life, haven't you? Pretending to be a loving husband and father while all along, you're a monster.\"\n\nKenny's face turned even paler, if that was possible, as he struggled against his bonds. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he stammered, but his eyes betrayed his panic.\n\n\"I know you do,\" I snapped, turning off the phone and stuffing it into my pocket. \"I'll make a deal with you, Kenny. Tell the truth about everything you've done, and that'll be the end of it. You'll go to prison, and I'll walk out of here.\"\n\nThe cop at the door was becoming impatient. \"We need to come in there, now. Open up!\"\n\nI swallowed hard, knowing that time was not on my side. The cops could break in any second. Kenny, sensing the danger, finally seemed to make a decision.\n\n\"All right, all right, I'll tell you,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"Yes, I've been the one doing it. I can't help it, something inside me...just...I need to do it.\"\n\nI felt a mixture of satisfaction and disgust. Part of me couldn't believe I was getting the confession I'd been chasing for so long, and part of me hated that it had taken so much pain and fear to get it.\n\n\"Good. Now tell your family the truth,\" I ordered, grabbing the hammer and positioning it over his leg. \"Or I'll start cutting.\"\n\nKenny began to sob openly, confessing everything to his horrified family. The tears, screams, and pleas filled the room as the reality of his actions sunk in for them. His confession was a mix of apologies, explanations, and denials, but in the end, it didn't matter. The truth was out.\n\nAs Kenny finished, the cops broke down the door. I was ready to fight, but an unexpected wave of exhaustion hit me. I hadn't realized how long I'd been pushing myself, how fragile the line between sanity and madness had become in this twisted game of cat and mouse.\n\nThe police officers quickly subdued me, taking me into custody whileparamedics attended to the injured members of Kenny's family. As I was led away, I couldn't help but glance back at Kenny, whose eyes were filled with a mixture of fear and relief.\n\nIt was over. The truth had finally been set free, and with it, a piece of my own torment. I didn't know what the future held, but for now, I was ready to face the consequences of my actions. I had done what I could to avenge my mother and bring a monster to justice, even if it meant sacrificing my own peace of mind. \n\nAs they led me away, the flickering lights of the room seemed to fade into darkness, and I found myself wondering if I would ever truly find freedom from the shadows.

{"id": "text_completion_023", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Sightseeing. It is what I tell myself I am doing as I stand here year after year, viewing wistfully in the distance towards a collective nothingness. Upon a beach of sea-blue sand, dully reflecting the neverending haze surrounding this place, I stare into the ocean's mist, serving only to further cover everything in the same grey blanket of total blandness. The waters are calm and unmoving, carrying no wind, perfectly still as all else is here. The only movement that reminds me time is not yet frozen is the wavering deep-blue hue the water carries with itself near the shoreline, refracting the sand's gem-like azureness in a listless dance, until once again fading into a lifeless grey. It is all I can do to stare at this hesitant ripple of blue. It draws me in until the dreary atmosphere ever so slowly fades out of my consciousness; a welcome refuge for my tired eyes.\n\n\nI am unsure when I first arrived at this place, it happened much like how one might forget a dream. Awaking with a moment of unfamiliarity, and a distant memory of a place that dives farther from your mind each second you try to grasp at it, until all that\"s left is the memory that there was something that happened, some thought that you engaged with thoroughly, but remembered nevermore. I had tried to find a way to get away from here. I've ran along these sands many times in search of solidarity from this place, but alas, the beach seems infinite in every direction. Even the water itself holds no secrets of escape, for it violently steepens only a few meters from shore, and attempting to run away from the beach is equally futile, I simply appear right back at the ocean after walking only a short distance away, as if this cursed place is just a loop one cannot escape by effort alone.\n\nSo, I stand and stare. Time passes here at a dreadful pace, and I have lost hope of returning to my past life. Even if I somehow rid myself of this place, a mind can only take so much of this desolation before permanently adapting to it. The little solace I hold is writing these words into the sands, for this land's apathetic nature is kind enough to leave the sands unmoving for me to use as a canvas of words and thoughts. There is little else to describe here so this writing will end I suppose. One day I may add to my scriptures in these sands, but this place is making me tired. So, I'll let it take my thoughts to sleep, hoping to dream of a place that isn't here.\n\n\n\nWriting Upon Blue Sands pt. 2, Sinking to Somber:\n\nMy mind skips upon my dead thoughts like these pebbles upon this familiar sea: plip, plop, plip are my thoughts, sinking into cold, lifeless insanity. My mind stands me along this beach once more, my body begging for the back and forth familiarity of flinging rocks towards the open nothingness—anything that isn't another nothing for my senses. I let the thoughts fall from my head and drag my body back to my scrawled words. I return to writing upon these blue sands to exorcise my mind from the silence and the blue.\n\nI think I've found blue to be so… depressing. At first it was a welcome sight from the ocean's horrid blanket of eternal grey, but now my mind is in constant battle between the greys and the blues and the brights and the dulls and the same pattern of refracting light of the water's dance with the sand until my mind simply surrenders to a single muddled color of somber. These are the patterns and contrasts of the sole two colors in this world that I once thought would hold significant importance to my sanity, but now they serve only to constrain my sanity to yet another nothingness.\n\nA mind cannot withstand absolute singularity of a concept for long before breaking; a single color or a single belief and ideal, a single order or a single life, a single one place of consciousness and decision-making that sits in eternal stillness for the extent of one's sanity—as afterwards, constraints on reality no longer matter to a broken mind. It is simply an environment that such a machine was not designed to survive in.\n\nSo, this world blesses me with living upon an eternal balance point between absolute singularity and necessary stimuli with its waveless sea, its stillborn breeze, and its shimmering azure sands that seep into your mind like drops of ink, leaving your thoughts stained forever blue. But again, I am blessed within this world to write within its sands and throw its stones back at itself in childish retaliation. The world could've let my writing disappear as my thoughts do, or let my stones skip only once instead of the occasional twice to my amusement. The world may steal my thoughts and feelings, forever lost within the depths of its sea, but it does allow solidarity from its environment in painfully short moments of self amusement through my actions here.\n\nUnfortunately they are far in-between each other, and once again I am feeling my thoughts having been thoroughly soaked into these sands, wishing to take leave of my head and send me to my nothingness once again. So, I'll lay within these sands, staring at my nothing until my sanity tips too far from its balance point, and I will decide to skip stones again tomorrow or maybe continue my writings here another night. Whichever one my mind has felt is a greater necessity to its survival in this apathetic wasteland of blue sands and lifeless waters.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "In my dreams, I am no longer a figure silhouetted against the endless sky of grey. Instead, I am a child upon the first steps of an adventure, the earth beneath my feet is a vibrant patchwork of greens and browns, blues and reds. The air is thick with the scent of life, of growing things, of promise and potential. The ocean in these dreams is not the insurmountable chasm of the waking world, but a gentle, welcoming entity that cradles the shore, inviting rather than intimidating.\n\nWaking to the endless blue is a jarring reminder that this existence is all that I am given, that the dreams I crave are but fleeting glimpses of a world beyond my grasp. The blue sands, once a canvas of endless possibility, now seem like a cruel joke played by forces beyond my understanding. I am tied to this place, to this color that drowns my thoughts and stains my memories.\n\nBut in the days that follow, a change begins in me. The words I write upon the sands start to hold more than just despair. They become a chronicle of my struggle, a testament to my will to survive, to resist the allure of this place's monochrome existence. The patterns of the waves, once a source of endless frustration, become subjects of study, each ripple and swell a unique story waiting to be told. The stones I throw into the water, instead of sinking without trace, create ripples that seem to travel the length of the world.\n\nThe more I observe, the more I notice the subtle changes in the landscape. The sea is not entirely devoid of life. Small fish dart around just beneath the surface, their scales reflecting in the sunlight like flecks of mica suspended in liquid glass. The sand, upon closer inspection, is not entirely uniform. It shifts from a deep, almost indigo at the shoreline to a lighter, almost ivory further out.\n\nInspired by these subtle signs of life, I begin to experiment. Using small shells and driftwood, I create little sculptures upon the beach, each one a tiny rebellion against the bleakness that surrounds me. I write of my newfound purpose, of the resistance that has sprung from my once-broken spirit. My words change from lamentations to declarations of defiance, from pleas for escape to statements of intent.\n\nThe world, it seems, responds in kind. The blue is no less omnipresent, but it no longer holds dominion over my mind. It becomes a backdrop, a challenge to be met and overcome rather than a prison to be escaped. My thoughts, once drowned in the sameness of the place, now soar over it, seeing beyond the surface to the stories and the struggle that lies beneath.\n\nYears pass in this new reality, and I realize I no longer desire escape. I have found purpose in this place of endless blue, in the small acts of creation and defiance that mark my days. The beach, once a symbol of my isolation, becomes a canvas of possibility, a world of color and life waiting to be discovered. And though I may never leave this place, I no longer see it as a curse. Instead, it is a challenge, a test of will and imagination that I have chosen to meet with hope and determination.\n\nIn the end, it is not the blue that defines me, but my response to it. I have found a way to live in this desolate landscape, to find beauty and meaning in a world that once seemed devoid of both. And in doing so, I have discovered something far greater than escape. I have found resilience, the ability to thrive in the face of adversity, to transform the constraints of one's environment into a source of strength and inspiration.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains coherence with the original text in terms of plot, character development, and tone.

{"id": "text_completion_024", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: We never thought in our most desperate hour that knowing how many toes on a possum could save a life. Because honestly, who has that kinda knowledge rumbling through their brain ready to be pulled out of their butt? No one. No one except a winner, and most of the time, they\"re just guessing and pulling crap out. But that guess gets them a ticket out of this life, and leaves the rest of us sorry losers in the dirt.\n\n\nThis may sound like ranting because it is. In a system that is already corrupted to the core by chance and social connections, Trivia Hour added an extra topping to that hot mess. At 12 in the afternoon and 6 in the evening, three quarters of the world pulled out some sort of device to gaze hopefully at their last chance for a pleasant life as the clock clicks down to 0 and bright blue words ask \"Are you ready?\". Three quarters of the world will desperately tap answer after answer, feeling their opportunity rising higher and higher until they click that one wrong answer, and they come crashing down into the garbage pile. Nothing matches the excitement of getting a question right and moving to the next round, the ultra combination of exhilaration and adrenaline gunning through your body and setting you on fire. And nothing matches that sub-abyssal low when you miss one, sinking into your stomach and tearing you from the inside out. Its a feeling that stays a lot longer than the high, the feeling that no matter what, no matter who you could\"ve been, you are never getting out. I know what it feels like because just like the other 5 billion, I\"m a sucker to the game. The game, the most hedonistic form of capitalism and emotional manipulation this side of the hill works like this:\n\nThere are 20 question, starting off easy before ramping to nearly impossible. All quick facts, no mathematical equations so I guess we have to thank the creators for that. You answer one wrong, you, and millions and billions, are booted. Here\"s the catch, so it\"s not just the entire population of China randomly guessing and crying into their phone: if you get someone to enter your username in as a referral code, you get a heart. A heart will save you for one wrong question and you can\"t use more than one a game. When the game started off, with only 2 maybe 3 hundred thousand logging in at 12 and 6, it was relatively easy to get a referral code from a friend just joining the game or a relative. But when the numbers kept going up and up as the weeks grew into months then years, you were considered blessed to get a heart, as rare today as finding a diamond amid coal. That\"s where things got ugly. People began to create massive amounts of accounts to get hearts, so the folks at Trivia Hour began demanding confirmation that the person creating an account was a real human. So this led to two things happening: people creating people as fast at they could, either by birthing children or smudging documents, and people going the opposite way, knocking off competitors permanently and stealing their phones in the hopes they could give a heart.\n\nI was born as one of the former options. My parents lived on the poorer end of the middle class spectrum. Kept us in a three-bedroom house in the suburbs on desk-jobs. The game came out when they were in their early twenties, when they already had Macy and Linden. When the Upturn struck, sending the economy into a vicious spiral, the low-end middle class felt in the hardest. After being let go of their jobs, the house in the suburbs was vacated for a slimy apartment in the city and mom and dad picked up work anywhere they could. The game before the Upturn was a fun, exciting way to connect across borders and learn new facts. The game after the Upturn became the light at the end of the tunnel for them. It no longer had that child-like appeal. It was business. Macy and Linden were given cheap phones and accounts when they were three and two, with my parents answering for them. Five years later, mom popped me and Pepper out to get more chances, before succumbing to an infection, probably grown in the petri dish of our home. Dad got desperate when she died. We stopped looking like kids, and more like washed out bed sheets as he struggled to put food on the table. Taking on three jobs was a lot, but Macy, as the oldest, was only 15 and was still required to go to school, just like the rest of us.\n\nIt looked pretty grim for a couple years, until dad was hired by an advertising company for the game, to mandate calls or whatever, and things started to pick up. There was food in the house 24/7 and Mace was given the chance to join an after school club centered around computer technology and design. She had to stay late at school but to her it was worth it, the extra hours. It scared Dad, and he made sure she had a can of mace for Mace. A family joke. It broke him when he got the call she was found in an alley on her way home, half-clothed and with no phone, a full can of mace next to her. It\"d be an understatement to say Dad was never the same after that. He lost his job when they found drugs in his urine tests, so he turned to peddling them on the streets. We didn\"t see him for a full week when it was Linden\"s turn to pick up the phone to the police\"s number. He was 14, and working as hard as he could to keep us all together, lying to social workers and neighbors, pulling hours at the gas station. When he went down to the station to identify the corpse, it was the last straw, and we were all shipped up and sent out to orphanages and foster homes.\n\nSo began my extra ordinary life, living from home to home, going to school when I could, playing the game. Always the game. The one constant in my short, ugly life, the companion to my every misery. Like millions, i considered ending it all. After the Upturn, the government passed legal consent to euthanize those who applied to the program. I even got in the line at the offices to sign up, at 16 years old, 8 years after the last time I knew what a family was. I got up to the desk clerk at 11:59, to this shriveled old hag. I opened my mouth to say good morning, because even with the decomposition of society, I still had manners, and this witch held a hand up and said, in absolute snotty authority,\n\n\"Please wait. The game has started.\"\n\nOn the edge of the cliff, about to throw myself off, I started to laugh. Trivia Hour wouldn\"t even let me end my life. So that\"s when I stopped being sad, stopped feeling like a pitiful sad sack of trash, and got angry instead. Angry at the game, angry at my life, angry at what I had lost, angry that my sister was killed for a heart because no one had one left to give.\n\nI\"m tired of waiting for a game to tell me if I\"m going to make something of my life, if I\"m going to break the chains on question 20. I\"m going to break them when I decide, and I\"ve decide I\"m breaking them now. Trivia Hour won\"t get a second chance because I\"ve no heart to give. Join me if you\"re ready\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Continuation:\n\nAs the years stretched on, the Trivia Hour game became the colossal beast that had taken so much from me and my family. My anger had turned into a silent resignation, a grim acceptance that this was our life – a relentless, merciless wheel that only spun forward.\n\nBut then something unusual happened. A rumour began to spread among the orphanages, foster homes, and streets – a whisper of rebellion, a thread of hope in the otherwise grey fabric of my existence. There was a group, an underground movement, they called themselves the \"Question-breakers.\" They didn't play by the rules of Trivia Hour; they defied it. Instead of being trapped by the questions, they sought to break free from the chains that bound them to this game, to overthrow it once and for all.\n\nAt first, I dismissed it as just another desperate scheme, another futile attempt to find hope in the darkest of times. But as more and more stories circulated, I found myself intrigued. These weren't just random acts of defiance; there was a plan, a strategy. The Question-breakers had discovered a way to hack into the Trivia Hour servers, to manipulate the game's algorithms, to give hearts to those who needed them most.\n\nI couldn't resist the allure of it. Here was a chance not just to change my life, but to change the lives of millions like me. I threw myself into the movement, learning everything I could about hacking, about servers, about the inner workings of the game. I became good at it, better than I ever thought I could be. And as I grew more skilled, so did my resolve to end Trivia Hour's tyranny.\n\nWe were like ghostly figures, moving through the digital world, saving lives, changing destinies. We didn't do it for recognition, for glory, or even for a promise of a better tomorrow. We did it because we had to, because we couldn't stand by and watch any more families be torn apart, any more lives be destroyed by a game that had become our greatest enemy.\n\nIt wasn't an easy fight. The Trivia Hour Corporation was powerful, with resources that seemed endless. They hunted us, tried to find us, to stop us. But we were quicker, more agile, and above all, more determined. We lost friends, comrades, in the fight, but we never lost our resolve.\n\nAnd then, one day, everything changed. It wasn't a hack, or a daring escape, or even a stroke of genius. It was something far simpler, far more profound. We realized that the true power of Trivia Hour lay not in the game itself, but in the fear and desperation it instilled in us. To beat it, we didn't need to destroy it; we needed to outgrow it, to find our own answers, our own hearts, without the game's permission.\n\nWe started small, creating communities, sharing knowledge, helping each other. We taught the lost and the broken, the marginalized and the outcast, to rely on each other, to build a new world from the ashes of the old. And slowly, as we grew, so did our strength, our resolve, our hope.\n\nThe Trivia Hour Corporation watched us, but they couldn't stop us. They tried to co-opt our movement, to twist it to their own ends, but we were too strong, too united. We were the question-breakers, and we had broken the question itself.\n\nAnd on a day like any other, as the clock struck 12 and the blue words appeared on screens around the world, we saw a new message. \"The game has ended. Thank you for playing.\"\n\nWe didn't cheer, we didn't shout, we didn't dance. We just looked at each other, knowing that we had won, that we had saved not just our lives, but the lives of millions. We had broken the questions, yes, but more than that, we had broken the chains, the fear, the desperation. We had found our own hearts, our own answers, our own futures.\n\nAs for me, I didn't end up becoming a hacker or a rebel. I became a teacher, a guide, a mentor to those who came after me. I showed them how to find their own strength, their own courage, their own hearts. And together, we built a new world, a world where no one has to play the game of Trivia Hour, a world where everyone can find their own answers, their own paths.\n\nIt wasn't easy, it wasn't quick, but it was worth it. Because we had broken the questions, and in doing so, we had broken the rules, the chains, the fear. We had found our own hearts, and we had given them to each other.

As the collar abraded away carbon from the latest inward dent in the hardly flawless exterior hull, matter entered the vacuum and oscillations turned to noise and heat.\n\nThe instrument panel took a neat kick from the pilot, blinked, re-calibrated via a feed-back loop and switched back on. As the inner and outer skins of the hull eased further apart under tension, a gravitational field formed, the noise stopped and fluffy popcorn balls stuck to all available surfaces.

I can see rebellion isn't quite your thing. I love your pop by the way. My relatives way back were peach farmers and I guess I've always liked the real peach juice in it. I know you'll give me that speech about it being a secret recipe of a dozen chemical compounds with four radioactively-induced herbal-style products and blah blah but I taste peach pop when I drink it.'\n\nExia scraped a heel across the dashboard and a display of options scrolled until she found the one she wanted. 'I'm going to use the tractor beam now to pull this module in. Mind the glare.'\n\nA blue-white finger shafted out and pinned one of the spinning pieces of debris like a moth to the night sky. In silence, it drew the block inward and the ship rotated with the photo-mechanical effort until both watchers were blinded as the arc of a reddened sun crossed their vision. The raw light flashed off the module's flank and through aching eyes they caught glimpses of its intricate design.\n\nOnly Exia felt the temperature rising for the second time that day as latent heat seeped through and flooded the compartment. She feathered the blast screens to deflect heat until the ship turned through and beyond. Raising them again, Exia manoeuvred the module until it locked with a clunk onto a key node of the hull.\n\n'So that's how it's done. I scavenge modules off corporate factions' ships and bolt them onto this one. A medical pod this time – and that's how I re-supply. Some of the pilots don't even care what gets lifted. The boat's not theirs I suppose, or they can't turn off course to deal with scavengers. Sometimes they ask for a date but mostly I just snap bits off them and go.'\n\nExia stood up for the first time in the conversation, put on a discreet visor and started to read.\n\n'What will you do with the medical pod? Sell it?'\n\n'I keep anything that might be useful and if it isn't useful, I keep it for extra armour. It says here, if I get diabetes from drinking too much of your cola, there's a programme for re-coating my liver with working liver cells to fix it. I can run that myself, according to Poodle.'\n\n'Oh no. You really shouldn't search on Poodle. The Azedware Corporation will note the condition to your profile and downgrade your life insurance rating.'\n\nIt dawned upon him that this might be inconsequential, given the vast and unpiloted blocks bouncing into one another behind her incredulous expression.\n\n'If I did report you as a dangerous delinquent, I suppose it wouldn't make much difference?'\n\n'You can if you want but there's not much sign of a Compliance mob out here. I'd scramble the shape of my ship and then my containers and components couldn't be told apart from anyone else's anyway, so go knock yourself out.' She honestly didn't care. 'Has anything improved at the glorious galactic centre in the last two years then?'\n\n'Definitely. There's a major debate about who owns and controls the regulation of time. The corporations prefer to know where they stand legally and the ownership of abstracts and constructs is a whole new field to carve up. If time can be owned, it can be licensed.'\n\n'Away from a planet it's all the same, hours, day and night. You can go mad from having fewer points of reference, like me. What's bed-time? I might never walk into a shop again, so there goes opening hours and I think I've completely lost my concept of Tuesday.'\n\n'Don't you miss it? Planetary life, I mean. Home, routine and family?'\n\n'Home was the Wexler-Watson Corporation. \"Hush kids. Comply or your parents don't get their increment because if we work for Watson, Watson has a beneficial shareholding in our family because he loves families\", which comes of being a computer by the way because he's compensating. Is that lifestyle?'\n\n'Watson isn't evil and neither is PAL for that matter.'\n\n'Who runs Xenon, of course.' Exia threw he head back to laugh and then lost the elegant high- ground, picking popcorn out of her spiky hair. 'I forgot you work for that creepy drone covered in disgusting skuzz, so will be used to licking a few itchy sockets.'\n\n'Which is prejudiced by the way; which is even worse than murder. PAL was originally designated Pizza and Laundry, so began as a delivery bot capable of machine learning. The drone's intelligence and abilities have reached such a level now that it\"s too valuable to deploy outside, so sends out humans to gather data or do anything dangerous. I think PAL just wants to find its purpose, now that all the basic service jobs can be delegated to people, although he still heats pizza at AGMs for shareholders. The only problem is he sometimes takes advice literally. He was told it's a bad idea to go outside without a waterproof outer layer, so he got himself completely coated in human skin. The donor was very well compensated.'\n\n'I'm sure. Well, I prefer it up here. It's not just freedom. I've seen things beyond description. Sprays of sparking magnesium set against the rising disc of a new world as someone's propulsion pod cheese-graters down their hull, skimming a solar mass to collect the denser hydrogen for fuel – you did know space is made of hydrogen and that's free fuel for scavengers? Or running through another faction's flotilla while they're stuck in the queue to hydrate their breakfast gloop and then pulsing to light speed like a comet through their stupid little campfire. Yeah, that's not as cool though as using the tractor to move dust particles in a nebula, which I did so I could write my name in letters twenty miles high that will stand for a few million years. I was the first to do that, incidentally. What did you do on your birthday?'\n\n'I saw an approved film graded 5 for stimulation, which unashamedly misrepresented cultural norms. Okay then, you have a good point but here's a question: How did you get a ship and weapons in the first place? That's not cheap and I don't see an executive currency implant in your finger.'\n\n'Well, put it this way, my surname's Skuttle.'\n\n'What, really? Like the inventor of the lattice neutrino cannon?'\n\n'Just like that, yeah. Norvo and Allegra Skuttle were my parents. It was a nightmare. They were always fighting. Then they improved a solar particle harvester and got investment from the corporations and turned into rich people always fighting, so my brother and I took off a lot. Then Dad discovered how to harden neutrinos into subatomic fabrics, so the forces and bonds between them really hit and separated molecular bonds rather than the neutrinos swishing straight through things, so the lattice neutrino cannon was born.\n\nThe original was on our kitchen table because Dad said if he completed it in the lab then Wexler would take it away. Mum came home and they started shouting and arguing about not telling Watson, then crunch, we were orphans. There was no mess, just us standing in the hall, trying to get our rods and cones back. We didn't hang around that day and spent our parents' Wexcoins on a basic flight module, then went back for the bazooka. I still remember trying to carry it down the walkways. When we found we could rebuild and develop our ship using bits blown off other module ships by molecular de-bonding, that was it: The future calling.'\n\nExia paused. 'Of course, there are other private raiders up here and some skunk designs being tested. I bet you didn't know about those, although they're sure to be corporate. Some factions won't even talk to anyone. They just see you as fair harvest, whether you're commercial haulage or scavenger. There's a particularly nasty bunch called the Twinblades who target your interior inertia negators, so when a ship at high speed stops, after running away or something, the pilot's momentum stays the same and they smash through their front panels, closely followed by everything else in the vessel, just spewing bodies and junk into space. Instant abstract expressionism.'\n\n'That's quite a lot to handle for, what are you, a teenager? I couldn't help noticing that you fly your ship by kicking the controls.'\n\n'That's about reach. This compartment's made for two pilots.'\n\n'Have you even completed pilot training?'\n\n'What's training? When you play pool, do you see it as an exercise in advanced trigonometry or do you just pick up the stick and poke?'\n\n'Fair enough, although it sounds hard staying sane up there without anyone around to talk to. You should realise that one day someone will move into that seat next to you and I wonder if then you'll stop kicking quite so hard, young lady.'\n\nExia made a non-committal huff and checked a compartmental integrity scan, then slipped a couple of fingertips lightly over the joystick, circled his hologram around the room until it stood in and out of the console, looked innocently into his eyes, tilted her head and shut it down hard with an upward thrust of her knee.\n\n'Ouch. Whoah.' Despite the distance, he folded anyway. This so wasn't in the training. 'I'm not without feelings you know and I was also beginning to appreciate your attitude, although I could never be like you, not that you've even asked my name. It took me years to get to H-grade responsibility in this job. If I go further, that's use of a spa and discounted meds. Look, I can help you.\n\nWe have a Xenon continental class mega-freighter coming in from the Algolian wormhole nine hours from now. I could ask them to check your hull and supplies or re-stock your oxygen but they aren't in communication range until they fall out this side of the cusp. It's amazing they always survive the deceleration from warp jump to super-luminal and then the step down to light-speed, but that's thanks to Watson because he cares.'\n\n'...and loves families, I know. Does it have a lifetime's supply of your gorgeous peach pop on it?' A bright smile, at last.\n\n'Several lifetimes, I should think.'\n\n'Ok. Then you were wrong.'\n\n'Sorry?'\n\n'About me settling for second prize... bzz pip.' Dots of popcorn turned into white lines as Exia sent\n\nthe scavenger ship to light-speed.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "As Exia's ship surged into lightspeed, the universe twisted into a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, a visual symphony that no earthbound artist could conceive. She had accepted the PR executive's offer, and the Xenon continental-class mega-freighter was carrying her hopes of re-supply and, perhaps, a permanent lifeline to the galactic core.\n\nNine hours earlier, time had stretched and folded upon itself as the freighter emerged from the Algolian wormhole, a colossal vessel against thevoid expanse. Its hull was a patchwork quilt of scavenged parts, each module a testament to the ship's long journey through the Frontier. The PR exec, now named Tiber, had waited patiently for the vessel to cross into range of their communication devices, the anticipation as palpable as the hum of the vessel's engines.\n\nThe freighter's captain was a grizzled veteran named Kael, his face a map of the cosmos, with wrinkles that told tales of solar storms and the endless expanse. He greeted Exia with a nod, sizing her up as he did. She was young, but her eyes carried the weight of worlds, of the Frontier's untamed beauty and dangers.\n\n\"Welcome aboard, Ms. Skuttle,\" Kael rumbled. \"Tiber's filled me in on your situation. We'll do what we can to help.\"\n\nExia nodded, her heart hammering in her chest. This was it, the chance to reconnect, to have a place in the galactic core again. The freighter's hold was a treasure trove of supplies, technology, and memories of a life she had left behind. She walked among the stacks of food, medical supplies, and spare parts, her fingers tracing the contours of items she had not seen in years.\n\nThe crew, a mixture of humans and synthetic intelligences, bustled around, each with their own purpose. Tiber had briefed them on the situation, and they all understood the stakes. As they worked, they shared stories of the core, of the bustling cities and the lush landscapes, painting a picture of a world that Exia had almost forgotten.\n\nAs the hours passed, the freighter's hold gradually emptied, and Exia's scavenger ship began to take shape. Kael and his crew had worked miracles, integrating new modules with old ones, creating a vessel that was stronger and more capable. The medical pod had been installed, and Exia, with the help of the ship's AI, had run the programme to repair her liver. She felt stronger, more alive than ever.\n\nAs the supplies were loaded, Exia found herself reflecting on her journey. She had left the core in search of freedom, of a life unbound by the constraints of corporations and compliance. But as she stood among the stars, she realized that freedom was not about being alone, but about being part of something larger than oneself.\n\nThe freighter's engines roared to life, and Exia felt a pang of longing as they prepared to return to the core. She had won second prize, but in the end, it was the connections she had made, the friendships forged among the stars, that had truly mattered.\n\nAs the freighter disappeared into the wormhole, Exia looked up at the sky, a tapestry of stars and dreams. She knew that her journey was far from over, that the Frontier held more secrets and wonders waiting to be discovered. But she also knew that she had found something far more precious than Kepler Cola or any prize: a sense of belonging, a community of explorers and dreamers who saw the universe not as a place to be conquered, but as a canvas to be painted upon.\n\nWith a heart full of gratitude, Exia turned her ship towards the stars, ready to face whatever the future held. For in the vastness of space, there was no such thing as alone. We are all connected, by threads of light and dreams, bound together in the tapestry of existence. And in the end, it is these connections that truly matter.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation does maintain narrative coherence with the preceding text, preserving the tone, pacing, and character development established earlier.

{"id": "text_completion_026", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: School had just begun and already Mr. Okada had lost Masaki's attention. Rather than copying down complex yet pointless math equations and functions, Masaki much preferred to daydream; he dreamt about being free from the oppressive constraints that society had put on him. He was always told to do well in school, to get into a good university and this would inevitably lead to a decent job as a salary man. Masaki couldn't care any less though. He wanted to simply enjoy life. The weather outside was strangely inviting. The sun was shining and there wasn't a cloud in sight. Masaki thought about jumping out of the third floor window and just escaping.\n\n\n\"Hey Kawada! Pay attention!\"\n\nMr. Okada, a math teacher of 16 years, had his methods of dealing with students like Masaki Kawada. Okada grabbed the piece of chalk that he was writing with, and with one swift motion hurled it towards Masaki's seat.\n\nBulls-eye.\n\n\"Ow.. ugh…\"\n\nThe piece of chalk hit directly in the center of Masaki's forehead and caused him to stumble and fall out of his chair. While on the wooden floor, confused at what just happened, Masaki looked around, his eyes meeting the eyes of each of his classmates; some were surprised, some were worried, other were holding back laughter.\n\n\"Is my class really that boring to you Mr. Kawada?\"\n\n\"Um.. yes sir.\"\n\nThe wrong answer.\n\nAnother piece of chalk was already flying through the air and it caught Masaki in the exact same spot where the first one had hit.\n\nThwack!\n\nRight as Masaki had regained his composure from being struck the first piece, he was sent back to the floor with another. And by this time the whole class was in laughter. It wasn't a surprise to anyone that Masaki had suffered. While Masaki Kawada is a relatively normal high school senior, he could be categorized as the class clown. Other than this mishap, the rest of the class period went relatively silently. Mr. Okada grabbed another piece of chalk from his seemingly endless boxes of chalk and resumed writing math equations on the board. Soon it was lunch break.\n\n\"Man…that Okada did not spare you an ounce of mercy today. It must have hurt\"\n\nShingo Kimura, Masaki's best friend grabbed his desk and merged it with Masaki's. Masaki normally ate lunch with Shingo and another friend, Kana Aizawa, but it seemed that she had something important to do at this time. \"I don't even understand how he throws the chalks so well. I'm more astounded by the fact that he can hit me from that far away!\"\n\n\"He must have had lots of practice.\"\n\n\"I mean, he gets his daily practice on you even now.\"\n\n\"Shut up, there are plenty of other students not paying attention. He just hates me or something. I'll be right back. I'm going to buy some juice\"\n\nMasaki walked out of his classroom and towards the vending machines. There were 3 lined up at the end of the hallway, each containing different variety of drinks.\n\n\"I think I'll get some green tea today.\"\n\nMasaki took out a 100 yen coin from his pocket, and inserted it into the machine, then proceeded to press the button for the bottled green tea.\n\nNo response.\n\n\"Damn… you have got to be kidding me.\"\n\n\"Let me give it a try.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nWhile Masaki was cursing the vending machine for eating his 100 yen coin, a girl that he had never seen before showed up. She was not wearing the school's uniform, so maybe a transfer student? She had a small slender frame and long straight jet black hair. There was an aura of class about her, and yet, she was giving the vending machine a series of roundhouse kicks.\n\n\"Hey! What are you doing?!?\"\n\n\"I am assisting you with the machine.\"\n\n\"And I'm telling you, there is nothing that can be done about it.\n\n\"Just one more try.\"\n\nIt was probably illegal to physically abuse the vending machine like that, but with one last swift kick to the side of the machine this girl had made it spit out at least 20 drinks. There were cans of various drinks rolling around on the floor. Not one can was green tea.\n\n'Just my luck'\n\n\"I'm pretty sure, it's broken now.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThe girl was nowhere to be seen. 'Maybe she slipped out after destroying school property not wanting to get in trouble, but she didn't even go to this school right? Wait, then if so, what was she doing here in the first place?'\n\nMasaki's mind was clouded by these questions. He picked up all the cans and made his way back to classroom 3-A. He arranged the drinks into a pyramid of cans on top of his desk as he asked random classmates to take them as they wanted.\n\n\"Why did you get so many drinks?\" Shingo asked.\n\n\"I didn't on purpose. The machine ate my money and this random girl showed up from nowhere and beat the machine half to death.\"\n\n\"Like hell I'll believe that.\"\n\n\"Why would I lie about something so outrageous?\"\n\nThere is no way anyone would believe such a ridiculous story, but Masaki did not have a reason to lie. So after that Masaki insisted that he was not lying, Shingo decided to believe in his friend.\n\n\"So do you know this girl?\" Shingo continued.\n\n\"Not a clue about who she is, she wasn't wearing our school uniform, so I wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"Was she attractive?\" At this point Shingo was just trying to pry.\n\n\"I didn't see her that well.\"\n\nThat was a lie. Masaki had seen this girl's face and still remembered it well. She resembled a doll, a seemingly harmless, but vicious doll. Remembering the vending machine, Masaki shuddered in his seat and sipped on his coffee drink that left a bitter taste in his mouth. A few hours later, school was over. Shingo, an avid member of the kendo club, ran over to the practice dojo located on the west side of the school building. Masaki, after school usually helps out at his family's cafe, Au Lait. A lot of students stop by afterschool, so it was always busy for Masaki.\n\n\"I'm home\"\n\n\"Welcome back, how was school?\"\n\nA woman stood in the entrance way of the store-front of a café. Inori Kawada, is the mother of Masaki Kawada. While 38 years old, she still looks like she was in her twenties. The local women would frequently ask her for beauty tips. \"It was fine.\"\n\n\"Masaki, did the shipment of Earl Grey leaves come in today?\" Remembering that he had received a package early in the morning and had done preparatory work before going to school, Masaki replied,\n\n\"Yeah, I sorted them into the usual tins and they should be on the middle shelf. Just give me a minute to put on my work clothes\"\n\nMasaki stepped into the back and started to change into his work clothing. Dress shirt, a vest, and a bow-tie. He felt like he was dressing like a butler, but it was a familiar feeling.\n\nThe shop had an interior décor that resembled something that you would find in France. Polished wooden floorboards on the ground, a rather dim lighting, and warm brown colors painted the walls. Ding-Ding-Ding, the bell rang as the customers began rolling in. \"Hello, may I show you to your seat?\" Masaki would ask as he showed the customers his best business smile. \"Please take a look at our menu, might I recommend for today Chamomile tea with crème caramel?\" Masaki usually recommended this combination as it was his two favorite relaxation menu items. The aromatic Chamomile tea always took away the stresses of school away and the savory sweet flavor of the crème caramel was delectable.\n\nAfter hours, Masaki would lie in bed and wonder about if there was anything more to life than his current circumstance. While he did the things that he had to do, he grew tired as the monotony of daily life took its toll. Masaki needed something else.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The next morning, Masaki found himself lingering over his breakfast just a bit longer, hoping he could delay the inevitable return to school. As he walked down the streets, he noticed familiar patterns of mundane life playing out before him: the same people going to work, children heading to school, not much changing, really. And yet, there was something different today. Perhaps it was the freshness of the chilly morning air or the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the path. Masaki felt a tinge of excitement, as if he was about to uncover a hidden aspect of his world, a sensation he had not felt in a while.\n\nSchool was as tedious as ever, and the chalk-tosses from Mr. Okada had become a routine that elicited neither surprise nor laughter from his peers. The episode with the vending machine had passed into a story in their collective memory, recited for amusement rather than disbelief. It was during lunch when Masaki couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He looked around, but the classroom seemed the same as always: students munching on their bento boxes, others gossiping, and a few engrossed in their textbooks.\n\nAs he walked back home, he felt a light touch on his shoulder. He turned around to find the girl from the vending machine incident, now wearing a school uniform that matched his.\n\n\"Hey, it's you!\" he exclaimed, not quite masking his surprise.\n\n\"Yeah, hi. I'm Mugi, new here.\" Her voice was as soft as a whisper, but there was a certain confidence in her gaze that contradicted her shy demeanor.\n\n\"Masaki, right? I saw what happened yesterday. You seemed to need a hand.\"\n\nA hint of a smile played on her lips as she said this. Masaki couldn't help but be intrigued. He had not expected to meet her again, especially not like this, at school, in proper clothes, as peers. He must have looked puzzled because she added, \"I transferred here recently. I knew it was you by your school uniform and by your chalk-scarred forehead.\"\n\nMasaki felt a blush rising to his cheeks. \"Haha, nice to meet you, Mugi. And thanks for the help yesterday. That thing was just being annoying.\"\n\n\"Sure. But hey, I meant what I said. You're too talented to be stuck in a place like this.\"\n\nHer words hung in the air between them, and Masaki couldn't think of anything to say. She seemed to read the confusion on his face.\n\n\"You know, there's more to life than just following the path others lay out for you. You have dreams, right? Maybe it's time to chase them.\"\n\nMasaki opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, a loud bell rang out in the distance, signaling the end of the school day. They both turned to look at the source of the noise, a large, old bell tower that stood at the center of the school grounds.\n\n\"I'll see you around, Masaki. Don't forget what I said.\" And with that, Mugi turned and walked away, her steps confident and sure.\n\nMasaki stood frozen for a moment, the bell's echoes fading into the background. He felt a thrill run down his spine, a feeling he had not experienced in a very long time. It wasn't just about the excitement of a new acquaintance, but more about the flicker of something new, something uncharted, opening up in his life.\n\nThat night, lying in bed, Masaki couldn't help but replay the encounter with Mugi in his mind. Her words, her demeanor, everything about her seemed to resonate with a part of him that had been dormant for far too long. He realized that he had spent so much time merely going through the motions, without even considering if the path he was on was truly his own.\n\nThe monotony that had once seemed so oppressive now felt like a challenge he could face, if he chose to. Masaki's thoughts turned to the next day, to school, and to the very real possibility that his life could change for the better, if he dared to chase his dreams.\n\nThe following morning, as he prepared to go to school, Masaki felt a sense of anticipation he had not experienced in a long time. Today, he decided, would be different. He wasn't sure yet what that meant, but he knew that it was time to stop merely existing and start truly living.

The creature she stalked was still drowsy and moved in a slow, clumsy fashion. The moment came, and Mei took it. She pounced out of the alleyway, running towards the man. The bakery owner looked up and was surprised to see a young teenage girl standing close by. Her puppy dog eyes fixed on him.\n\nHe had just started opening his shop and was putting his bread outside to sell. Mei's eyes moved from his face to the bread in his hand. He moved it a few times, watching her eyes follow it with extreme accuracy.\n\nHe sighed loudly, knowing he was beat. He handed over the piece of bread and was rewarded with a large smile. The corners of his own mouth turned up in a smile as he watched Mei disappear into the alley.\n\nUnfortunately, she ran right into a small ambush. Three men, all looking down on their luck, stood there waiting for her. The boss, a man that towered over the other two, held out his hand for the bread. \"Street tax,\" he said. One of his followers, giggled nervously.\n\nThey thought Mei would be easy pickings. She was a twelve year old, Chinese girl, very petite. She barely reached the boss' large stomach. Her clothing was in the Chinese fashion, with a tight top with loose, flowing arms and loose pants, all in a greenish-grey colour. Her bright red shoes, looking something like slippers were the only real colour on her. Her long black hair was tied up tightly on her her head and was covered by a newsboy cap. To these tough men of New York city, there seemed nothing to be scared of.\n\nShe put the bread between her teeth, holding on to it, for safe-keeping. The man leered down at her, cracking his knuckles to emphasize his point. Between the crack of his first knuckle and his second, Mei had made her move. She reached down to the ground, going into a handstand with her legs in the air. She then pushed off from the ground hard. The soles of her shoes found the bottom of the man's chin. His expression barely changed, as he fell to the ground, unconscious.\n\nThe man's two friends looked at each other in disbelief. That had to have been an accident. They nodded to each other, working up the courage to test her. As they moved to surround her, Mei regained her feet. In a fluid motion, she punched with her right fist and kicked with her left foot, hitting both men squarely in the stomach at the same time. They both doubled over, feeling sick. Mei stood as tall as she could, still only about as high as the men crouching over in pain, and glared strongly at the both of them. The effect of the glare was somewhat lessened by the large piece of bread held between her teeth. It did its job, however, and the men ran off, leaving their boss lying on the ground.\n\nMei sat down on the unconscious form of her would-be attacker. There was a slight chill in the air and he was a warm seat. She stared out at the city through the small opening of the alley. It was still early. A few store owners had started their opening exercises, but it was too soon for the customers to come out. The few others that stood around were those that were universally known as loungers. They did not have enough money to buy anything, but sitting at home was too boring, so they simply walked the streets, aimlessly.\n\nAimless wandering was one of the most popular activities of the day. Mei had forgotten the exact date long ago, but it was sometime in the 1930's. The Great Depression was in full swing. Many people did not have jobs, and they had given up looking for one some time ago. So, they simply wandered. It eased the hunger pains in their stomachs, and the pains of pride in their hearts for being jobless and unable to provide for their loved ones.\n\nMei did not blame the man that was now temporarily her warm seat. The Depression had caused many to turn to desperate acts that they would have shied away from in happier times. He was hungry, she was hungry, and there was only enough food for one. Living had lost its pleasures and was now a test for survival.\n\nWhile those around her had been forced into this life, Mei, however, had actually chosen it. She could not imagine the people of her tiny village being affected by something so trivial as a world-wide depression. And it was only because she had left, that she now faced the harsh life of the streets.\n\nShe was searching for her older brother, Li. One night, he had simply disappeared. The village's treasure, a jade dragon sculpture, had vanished along with him. She would never believe the liars that said he had stolen it.\n\nIt had been a little over two years since she had left. She had searched most of China for a sign of him, and had finally arrived in Hong Kong. Her talents for fighting allowed her to survive life on the city streets, but she heard nothing of her missing brother. That was when something miraculous happened to point her in the right direction.\n\nRunning down the streets, being chased by bullies much larger than the ones she'd just dealt with, Mei found a small alley to hide in. The bullies passed her by. But just as Mei was about to breathe out a sigh of relief, a small flash of green light, the colour of jade, appeared against the far wall. The sigh caught in her throat. The light grew brighter and larger, much larger. After a moment, she could make out the image of her brother, completely green.\n\nMei reached out with a trembling hand. \"Brother?\"\n\nLi looked around, as if he were lost. \"America,\" he said, haltingly. His voice seemed to come from a far off distance, even with him standing right in front of her. \"You must go to America.\"\n\nWith that, Li simply disappeared. The green light in the alley was snuffed out completely. Mei sat down on the cold ground and cried.\n\nThe next day, she made up her mind to travel the long distance to America. She had snuck aboard a merchant ship, and hid inside the cargo hold. She lived off scraps that she could steal from the crew. The rats took the blame for her tiny feasts.\n\nAnd now, here she was in New York, still fighting, still begging for food, and still without a clue to her brother's whereabouts. The warm bread started to taste a little salty from a couple tears that she couldn't keep back. Two years of world traveling felt like an eternity for the young girl.\n\nA flash of green interrupted her thoughts, before the waterworks really began. It was there! Something incredibly large, the same green colour her brother had appeared as, streaked quickly past the alley she sat in. Mei jumped off the man, leaving the last portions of the bread beside him and took off running.\n\nAs soon as she left the alley, Mei realized she was not chasing her brother. It was the Jade Dragon come to life, only infinitely larger. Lifesize, she supposed, but she had no idea what scale a lifesize dragon would actually be. Instead of regular flight, it seemed to twist itself through the air and clouds, like a gigantic snake slithering along the ground. Every twist, every movement was so full of beauty, though.\n\nMei kept it within sight as she chased after its tail. Though there was very few people out at this time, she wondered how a dragon the size of a football field could create so little attention. Everyone just went about their business, completely ignoring the flying monster. If anything, it was Mei herself, that gained the most attention, with people jumping out of her way or yelling at her to stop running so fast. She had always been a polite girl, at least decently so, but she just ran straight through them.\n\nFinally, after turning a corner, she came face to face with the dragon. It had come to a halt, and now the magnificent green monster looked down at her. It seemed still, yet its body moved constantly, keeping it airborne. There was a sense of sadness in its majesty. Mei could do nothing but stand there with her mouth open. And, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the great dragon vanished in a rush of air.\n\nBut this wasn't all. Loose papers that were lying around were blown up with the rushing air. They swirled around Mei until she reached out and grabbed one. It seemed like a poster advertising a detective agency.\n\nIn bright, bold lettering, it read, \"Spooks, spectres, ancient curses? Are you having trouble with magic? Come see the Magic Detective.\"\n\nMei was shocked. \"This can't be a coincidence.\" No sooner than saying that, she looked around and saw the same poster everywhere. It was plastered on walls, on benches, under the wipers of cars, literally everywhere. A little doubt crept into Mei's last statement. \"Or, maybe it is.\"\n\nA little while later, on the other side of town, Mei reached the address of the so-called Magic Detective. The exterior did little to stir the imagination. It was a squat, brown brick building. It was the kind of place where the architect must have given up on ever creating real beauty and had settled on practicality. It was not ugly, just dull.\n\nWith her paper flyer in hand, Mei approached the front door. She was an incredibly brave girl, but she could not hold back a slight shaking in her limbs as she knocked. She had not found many people she could trust in her travels, and this magic business sounded a little sketchy. There was no answer. She tried again, with the same result.\n\nIgnoring her desire to leave, and her temper rising with being ignored, she tried the handle. This was a success and she took her first step inside. She entered into a hallway, long and narrow. \"Hello…?\" She asked the empty air, a little tremulously. Gathering her courage, she walked forward and reached a door. Without even bothering to knock, she opened this one.\n\nIt was like looking at a disaster zone. Papers and books and who knows what else covered the floor creating a miniaturized landscape of hills and valleys. A large table stood along the back wall covered in metal and chemical experiments. Two small birds, one yellow, the other blue, flew around the room, as if they were looking for a way to escape. There was a window, but it was half-covered by stacks of books. The only source of light came from a large fireplace in the corner. The coals inside burned low, but still seemed a danger in this room of loose paper and books.\n\nThe place filled Mei with a sense of horror. She turned to go, but something long and warm shot out of the pile of trash and grabbed onto her ankle, holding her there. Mei froze. She wanted to run but her body had gone numb with shock. Her brain was left screaming while her body moved slower than ever before. It took her over ten seconds to finally turn her head enough to look down at her leg. It was a hand! She saw a long arm reaching out from the refuse, and now it was slowly pulling her back in.\n\nMei reacted instinctively. She grabbed the largest object at hand, a massive book, and brought it down hard on the monster hidden in the papers.\n\n\"Ow!\" was the only response she got. The hand recoiled and out of the papers a young boy stood up. He was a curious sight. Mei felt he was probably about thirteen years old, though he could have been younger, as he was short and very, very thin. He was dressed in decent clothes, a shirt and tie, and suspenders help up his wool pants. But everything was worn in a sloppy manner. The tie was slightly crooked, the shirt needed a good ironing, and one of the straps of his suspenders had fallen off his shoulder. This sloppiness was emphasized all the more as he was now vigorously rubbing his sore head, messing up his tousled brown hair even further.\n\n\"Do you always hit people when you visit them?\" he asked.\n\nMei blushed deeply. \"I didn't mean to. You grabbed me.\"\n\nThe boy waved his hand, as if he no longer was interested in the subject. He tapped his index finger against his pursed lips as he stared intensely, and without a shade of embarrassment, at his guest. Mei was definitely feeling uncomfortable under his scrutiny. It was if she was some kind of interesting bug on the slide of a microscope.\n\n\"Hmmm…\" he said, after a few moments. \"You're from northern China, but you've spent some time in Hong Kong, and only recently made it here. You're an athlete, or some kind of fighter. And, you've got a problem with magic.\"\n\nMei was shocked. \"How did you know all that?\"\n\nThe boy yawned, as if he'd just woken up from a nap. He brushed together a pile of the surrounding papers and sat on them like a stool. \"I can tell by the muscles in your arms and legs - it's not that hard to notice them through your clothes - that you must be extremely athletic. The fact that your Chinese is obvious, and Chinese boxing or Kung Fu has become famous in the last while. Wasn't that difficult. Your clothes are all styled in the Hong Kong fashion, so it made sense that you've spent a long time there. The length of time is obvious by the age of your clothes. They've seen better days. That's also how I could tell you've been living on the streets.\"\n\nMei blushed a bright scarlet. She looked down at the worn-out knees in her trousers and the loose threads at the end of her sleeves. She made a movement to try to hide some of the worst aspects of her clothes. She stopped herself quickly, however. Her blushing face took on a look of intense pride. She held herself up stiffly and glared at the boy, almost daring him to find more faults with her. The boy did not seem to notice, as he continued on with his assessment.\n\n\"Of course, I realized that I was wrong in thinking that you were from Hong Kong as soon as I saw your necklace. It's obviously from northern China. It's been taken good care of, more than anything else you own, so it has sentimental value. Not that hard of a guess that it's from your homeland. And as to you needing help, well...\" The boy suddenly grinned widely. \"Hello, my name is Tobi. If you're here looking for me, then you definitely need some help.\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm looking for you?\"\n\nHe pointed to her hand. \"You're holding one of my flyers.\"\n\nMei's eyes opened wide as she looked down at her hand. \"Oh! Of course.\"\n\nTobi sat himself more comfortably on the pile of papers he had made into a temporary chair. He reached into a pocket and pulled out a small chocolate wrapped in colourful paper. He unwrapped it, threw the paper behind him to join with the other scattered trash, and placed the chocolate into his mouth. A dreamy look of pleasure came over his face as he slowly chewed and swallowed the small piece of candy.\n\nThat look of pleasure only slightly decreased as he looked his guest over again. \"So,\" he said finally. \"What brings a girl from northern China to Hong Kong and then all the way to my humble home?\"\n\nMei had seemed entranced by the spectacle of Tobi eating the chocolate, but she shook herself awake now. She looked again at the waist-high piles of paper, at the dirty shelves and the busted birdcage. There was nothing in sight that gave her the slightest confidence in this strange little boy. Her problem was not a normal one, and the visions she had were definitely unnatural. There was no way that someone like this boy could help her.\n\n\"I think I've made a mistake,\" she said as she turned to go. \"I'm sorry for wasting your time.\"\n\n\"It's do with magic, isn't it? Your problem, that is.\"\n\nMei turned back quickly to face him. \"Only some of us thought the dragon was magic.\"\n\nThere was something strange in his smile. If Mei had not turned and looked at him, she would have left then and there. That smile, though, it was so full of it's own genius, so confident that it was always right about everything. That smile irritated her. It also made her feel like she should trust this boy to help her.\n\n\"Come with me,\" he said, quietly, as he stood up. \"I want to show you something.\"\n\nTobi took Mei's hand and led her further into the room. She stumbled over several piles of old papers. When she looked up, they were standing in front of the large fireplace.\n\n\"Where are you taking me?\"\n\n\"Into the fire,\" answered Tobi. His tone was simple, but it still felt ominous. As if on cue, the low burning fire burst into life. The flames towered over the two children. Tobi grasped Mei's hand even tighter, almost crushing it. He stepped towards the roaring fire, pulling her with him.\n\n\"No!\" she cried, but it was too late. The two of them fell forwards, into the flames.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Tobi and Mei found themselves in a place far different from the chaotic and dirty room filled with papers. The air was cool and scented with pine, and the noise of the city had been replaced by the whisper of leaves and the distant call of birds.\n\nThey stood in a lush forest, surrounded by towering trees with leaves that glowed in hues of silver and green. Through the foliage, sunlight streamed in ribbons, creating a mosaic of light and shadow on the forest floor. It was a world untouched by time, ancient and serene.\n\n\"Welcome to The Enchanted Forest,\" said Tobi with a flourish, as if he were the host of a grand ball. He let go of Mei's hand and began to walk further into the forest. Mei followed, her eyes wide with wonder and a hint of apprehension. She had seen so much in her travels across the world, but this was something different, something magical.\n\nAs they walked deeper into the forest, the trees grew larger and more imposing, their trunks thick and covered in a shaggy moss. The air was thick with magic, and Mei could feel it surrounding her, a tangible presence that hummed beneath her skin. It was both exhilarating and terrifying.\n\nTobi led her to a clearing where a small pond lay, its waters as still as glass. In the center of the pond, a tiny island rose, crowned by a single tree. The tree was unlike any Mei had ever seen, its bark a deep, rich purple and its leaves glowed with an inner light. It was a tree of myth, a tree of legend.\n\n\"Here,\" said Tobi, gesturing to the island. \"This is the Tree of Life. It is ancient, older than the world itself, and it holds the essence of all living things. It is here that I can see the truth of your problem.\"\n\nTobi closed his eyes and began to chant in a language Mei did not recognize. The language of magic, perhaps. The words wove a spell of power that hummed in the air, a melody that seemed to resonate with the very essence of the forest. As he chanted, the leaves of the Tree of Life rustled, and a soft glow began to emanate from the tree's branches.\n\nThe glow grew brighter, a brilliant light that filled the clearing. Mei shielded her eyes as the light intensified, and then, with a sudden flash, it was gone. When she looked again, she saw a vision emerge from the light, a vision of her brother, Li.\n\nLi was bound, his hands tied behind his back, and he was being led through a dark, winding tunnel. There was a sense of urgency in his movements, as if he was being rushed, and his eyes held a look of desperation.\n\n\"Li!\" Mei cried out, but her voice was lost in the vision. She reached out towards him, but her hands passed through the glowing image as if it were a mere wisp of smoke.\n\nThe vision began to fade, the edges blurring and dissolving until there was nothing left but the Tree of Life and the reflection of the two children in the still waters of the pond.\n\n\"We must find him,\" said Tobi, his voice filled with determination. \"This vision shows that Li is in danger, and we must find him before it's too late.\"\n\nMei nodded, her heart racing with the realization that she was not alone in her quest. She had found someone who believed in the magic of the world, someone who could see the truth of her journey. Together, they would uncover the mysteries of Li's disappearance and find the Jade Dragon.\n\nAs they left the Enchanted Forest, Tobi turned to Mei with a grin. \"Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime?\"\n\nMei smiled back, her eyes alight with the promise of the journey ahead. \"I am.\" She looked around at the forest, at the glowing tree, and at the peaceful clearing. She had found more than a guide on her journey; she had found a friend. Together, they would face the unknown, armed with courage, magic, and the unbreakable bond of siblings.\n\nAnd so, their adventure began.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation aligns well with the tone, characters, and overall plot structure of the original story.

{"id": "text_completion_028", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: Hello! What's up? What is crackalackin? I never know how to start these things. Hell, I've never written anything of real substance before. I was just told by a few friends to start writing this. Whatever this is. See, I have a pretty strange job. That job being, I'm a librarian. That's not the strange part though. I work nightshift, as a librarian. Quite the kicker, huh? I've frequently scrolled through these forums and pages reading stories as I pass the time during my working hours, and naturally I stumbled here.\n\n\nThe job itself isn't all too bad, just very monotonous and tedious. Is that redundant? Maybe. So, a bit about my job. I sit behind a desk for a few hours, walk around a bit, come back, sit back down, and repeat. It may seem a lot worse than what it actually is..and you're right. You see, there are these little...I don't even know what to call them. I guess they are like a sugar glider? Lemur? Whatever the fuck Mort from Madagascar is? I don't know, I've only ever seen them a few times and even then, it was just for a second. To put it lightly, they like to fuck with my shit. Like I will be sitting here at my desk and I will be drawing. I would get up to make my rounds and I will come back and the drawing will be messed up! Just a bunch of incoherent scribbles and at the very bottom of the page, in the bottom right, what looks to be a signature. I would be impressed but they don't even do a good job. Not to mention, those FUCKERS always steal my pens.\n\nNow with any job, you will have your good and bad days. For example, I will have a really good night where nothing happens and my drawings won't get tampered with while I am making my rounds. On the other hand, I will come across a totally not inconspicuous wormhole in the science fiction section or a Yeti in the folklore section. I'm only joking about the wormhole part, that has only happened once here and that was right before this position opened funnily enough.\n\nI do think I have to elaborate on what \"doing my rounds\" entails. For the first round I make every night, I simply just put the books that have been returned where they need to be. The only other possibility is to clean up anything that has not been cleaned before closing which is very rare. My shift starts at 9:30PM and it is imperative that someone is here all night so it ends at 7:00AM. The library itself closes to the general public at 8:00PM. That gives the closers ample amounts of time to tidy up and leave notes for things that still need to be done once I am on shift. Right after I complete my first walkthrough of the library, I unlock the front doors so that the not-so-general public may peruse our selection. More on that later. For the next few hours, I spend my time doodling, writing, or helping out those who come into the library. Every so often, I will leave my desk and walk through the library just to check on things really.\n\nThere's never really been anything too bad to happen here. Just a few dead bodies, shady figures standing outside at all hours of the night, those aforementioned lemur shits, and a small bible\"s worth of other things. I plan on expanding what I already have written as time goes on, seeing as how I have essentially nothing but time and absolutely zero fucking pens OR pencils if I may so graciously add. Like okay, the least they could do is leave a quarter. Hell, I'd even take pennies at this point.\n\nNow, for the library itself. On the outside, it looks like any regular municipal library would look like. But on the inside, it gets a little more interesting. Once you walk through two sets of glass doors, you are greeted with a Victorian esque interior. Shined oak floors stretch across the entire floor, the doorframes have those weird but aesthetically pleasing frames that you always see in this style of architecture, add onto that a dull green and gold pattern on the walls. If you for some reason decide to look up, you will see rafters and arguably nothing past that. A chandelier hangs over the desk I essentially live at, which might I add, is candle lit. Every source of light within the library is a candle. Which is quite odd. Hell, we have one guy come in at least once a week that bitches about it and insists we try out his new invention. I keep telling him that we are very highly considering it just so he won't shock me. He keeps asking me if I'm married and he always says, \"I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.\" Truthfully, I can't name many inventions to begin with. Much less with that kind of criteria.\n\nNow, on to my desk. Imagine the desk that the president sits at, or even the one the queen would sit at. Now, make it larger. A lot larger. That is the desk I want. The desk I have; however, is like a mini version of both of those desks. I quite like it though. Numerous drawers line my work space, which is where I keep my writing utensils...if I fucking had any left. I also keep paper, both loose-leaf and regular documentation papers around for various library tasks. Other than that, I have two candles on either side of me for better lighting. There are a few small doors on the desk that I have no idea what they go to, and yes, they ARE doors. I checked. They have little hinges and doorknobs made out of brass. There is one located on either side of my desk at floor level. All of these marvelous and beautiful things, yet a cheap office chair from the nineties is what I get to sit on. It doesn\"t even have arm rests. Plus one of the wheels is broken so it doesn't even roll properly.\n\nAs for the book section...well it kind of depends on the section. Each section has only minor differences, yet those differences rely on the theme of the section. The similarities of each section lie in that all the bookcases follow the same oak wood build. Now for the differences. Say, for instance, you want to peruse the history section. The inlays for the wood be history related. For folklore, folklore related. See the pattern here? I find it all quite neat, until you get shot in the side of the head with a toothpick sized arrow by a Native American on horseback...little shits.\n\nThat thing is outside again. If anyone has ideas of what to do with it, please let me know. The shape of it is always different, but the same spot and same time mean the same thing. If something looks like a creepy bastard, feels like a creepy bastard, and probably smells like a creepy bastard...it is probably a creepy bastard. As for my writing utensil dilemma, where can I get pens and pencils for dirt cheap? It's getting ridiculous at this point.\n\nIt looks like a patron is coming in, I'll keep you guys posted. This guy is one of the ones we need to keep a general eye on while they are here...and he likes to stay awhile.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "Continuation:\n\nI groaned as I watched the familiar figure saunter into the library. Mr. Cranston, as I liked to call him, was a regular visitor around these parts of the night. His eyes always danced with an odd blend of excitement and apprehension. He was one of the few who knew the library like the back of his hand, and he loved to sit in the corner of the history section, illuminated by the soft glow of the candles, lost in the writings of the old world. But, like clockwork, he always managed to mess with something while he was here.\n\n\"Evening, librarian,\" he greeted me with a toothy grin as he made his way behind my desk, carefully avoiding the mischievous creatures that were always lurking about.\n\n\"Evening, Mr. Cranston. How are you doing tonight?\" I replied, trying to keep my voice even and not show how much I didn't enjoy his presence.\n\n\"Oh, I'm doing just fine. Never better,\" he chuckled, sliding into the chair opposite me. \"You know, I was thinking the other day, about the nature of time and its relation to the cosmos. It's quite fascinating, really. One moment you're in the presence of the cosmos, the next you're lost in the vastness of it all.\"\n\nHis words were oddly soothing, and for a moment, I forgot about my troubles with the mischievous creatures and the constant loss of my pens. \"That's quite poetic, Mr. Cranston. Literature does have a way of doing that.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it's not just literature. It's the stories within us. The way we narrate our lives, much like a book on a shelf. Each moment, a page turn. Each conversation, a new chapter,\" he mused, his eyes glazing over as if he were visualizing his thoughts.\n\nI couldn't help but be drawn into his words, forgetting the time. It wasn't often that someone could make the mundane seem so magical. I watched as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, tarnished locket. \"This was my mother's,\" he said, his voice a mixture of sadness and pride. \"It holds a story within it, a story of love and loss, of times long past, yet still present.\"\n\nFor a moment, I found myself curious about this locket. What was it that it held? What lost stories did it keep close? I found myself wanting to know more, to dive into the history it contained. \"May I?\" I asked hesitantly, my fingers itching to hold the locket, to feel the weight of its stories.\n\nMr. Cranston nodded, and I carefully took the locket from his hands. It was heavier than I imagined, the metal cool against my skin. As I examined it, I noticed a small, almost imperceptible crack in the metal. It was then that I felt it, a surge of something ancient and powerful. Images flooded my mind, stories of love and betrayal, of victories and defeats. It was as if the locket had opened a door to another world, a world within the library itself.\n\n \"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" Mr. Cranston's voice broke through the images, bringing me back to reality. \"The stories we hold, the stories we tell, they shape us, they define us.\"\n\nAs I handed the locket back to him, I realized that perhaps the library wasn't just a place for books. Perhaps it was a place for stories, for the forgotten tales of the past. Maybe that was why the creatures lurked, why the odd things happened. Maybe they were drawn to the stories, to the tales of love and loss that filled the library.\n\nAs the night wore on, I found myself lost in thought, contemplating the stories within the library, within the locket, within myself. Perhaps the loss of my pens was just another story, another chapter in my own narrative. And perhaps, just maybe, I was beginning to understand.\n\nThe night ended as it usually did, with Mr. Cranston bidding me a good night and disappearing into the darkness, leaving behind nothing but the quiet hum of candlelight and the echoes of forgotten stories. As I locked up for the night, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the strange, magical job that I had.

I was living in a run-down shack of a house that had no heat and it was well into the winter. There was no cable, only an antenna taped to the top of the television that only got signal for about four channels, wooden planks missing in the bathroom and bugs roaming all about the house. The mattress I slept on had sharp springs protruding in random spots that I could never seem to avoid. And to make it all worse, I had no transportation or a phone to call for someone to pick me up, because my boyfriend had taken both with him to work that morning.\n\nI slowly rubbed my belly and cried until my tears dried up, leaving me with nothing but burning eyes and a terrible headache.\n\nI knew I had to get out of this, but how? I never had the courage to leave although everything in me had been telling me to run from the very first time he hit me. But I stayed, I stayed and let the abuse continue. I let him alienate me from my family, the only people who have ever truly loved me. I let him steal all of my joy, for what? So I can stay with him and live this shitty life that no one wants? So I can live my life worrying about when the beatings will get worse or if he will do the same thing to our son later in life? I knew I needed to leave, but I also knew that there was still something holding me back.\n\nI lay back on the bed as carefully as I could and stared up at the ceiling, thinking about the night that started all of the darkness in my life:\n\n I had gotten into some trouble and decided to move back to Oklahoma with my mom and my sister, and I was even able to convince my mom to let me bring along my boyfriend, Eric, and my puppy. We had only been there for about a week when we were invited to my best friend Carly\"s birthday party.\n\n Everyone was having a great time, drinking, dancing and laughing. After a while, the party had wound down, leaving only a small group of us that had all gone to high school together, Eric being the only outsider.\n\n We gathered in a circle and decided to play a game of Never Have I Ever, for \"old times sake\". Having known a good amount of dirt on everyone, we all began to sabotage each other. As my fingers began to drop as I silently admitted the things I\"d done, I noticed a shift in Eric\"s demeanor.\n\n \"Never have I ever had sex in the same room as someone else\", Carly snickered as we both locked eyes and dropped out last finger simultaneously.\n\n I stood up to go take a shot with her to commemorate our losing the game, when Eric tightly gripped my arm.\n\n \"Come outside real quick\", he said as he led me towards the front door.\n\n \"What\"s up?\", I say as I lean against my car to maintain my balance.\n\n \"Yo, what the fuck was that? You been out here bein\" a hoe or sum\"?\"\n\n \"What are you even talking about? That stupid game? Am I not allowed to have had a life before I met you?\"\n\n \"You were having sex in the same room as someone and -\"\n\n \"Okay, first of all, yes my BEST FRIEND and I DID have sex in the same room before but nowhere near each other. Second of all, we were both with our boyfriends. And FINALLY, how the fuck can you be mad about something that happened YEARS before I ever even met you?!\", I yelled.\n\n \"Man fuck this, I\"m ready to go\" he said as he made his way to the driver door.\n\n I text Carly and told her Eric was tripping so we were leaving and hopped in the passenger seat to head back home. We were almost back to my mom\"s house when he started belittling me.\n\n \"I should have just stayed with my first baby mama, at least she was better than you. She was neat, always had the clothes washed and the room clean. And she wasn\"t a fuckin\" hoe\", he muttered.\n\n \"I\"m sure you would have stayed with her if you could but you fucked that up, didn't you? If she wanted you, you wouldn\"t even be right here starting this shit with me and you would be able to know your daughterthat you\"ll never see!\"\n\n He turned left at the intersection, heading the opposite way from home. As we drove past my old high school he continued to say any and everything he could to get under my skin and hurt me. I couldn\"t take it anymore, I screamed and mushed the side of his head, knocking the earring out of his ear.\n\n Before I could say anything he punched me square in the face, then grabbed me by my hair, slamming my head into the dashboard multiple times. I held my face and cried as we pulled into the EzGO parking lot. I was hurt and furious that he would do something like that to me.\n\n I lashed out and fought back, only to be hit again, with more force this time. I turned to get out of the car and run into the gas station when he grabbed my arm and pulled me back into my seat. My eyes locked on a man parked next to us who had watched everything unfold, and he turned his head and started backing out to leave.\n\n I had no help.\n\n I swung at him with all of my strength, colliding my right fist into his jaw. He paused for a moment then took the cigarette out of his mouth and burned me in the center of my forehead. That was it, I had no more fight left. I was humiliated and left to suffer by the stranger beside me.\n\n My eyes welled with tears and I cried like I never had before. I felt defeated. He immediately began to apologize and promise that he would never hurt me again. We both cried the rest of the way back to my mom\"s house as he begged me not to tell anyone what happened.\n\nI slowly sat up and dried my face with the bottom of my t-shirt.\n\n\"I have to get out of this before I can\"t anymore\", I whispered to myself.\n\nI never understood why it was so hard for me to leave someone who was doing me so much harm. I can\"t say that I stayed for the love he made me feel, because I really didn\"t feel loved. I felt like a burden, like nothing I did would ever be good enough to make him stop treating me the way he did. And yet, when my family told me to leave him I found every excuse I could think of to stay with him.\n\nI spent more time blaming myself and wondering what I did to him to make him feel the way he did towards me than worrying about how the way he treated me made me feel. Putting his happiness before mine had become second nature to me, it no longer mattered how many nights I spent crying myself to sleep as long as I could get him to go a day without getting mad at me.\n\nI\"ve always heard that women who grow up without a father wind up having a lot of problems with men because of their need to fill the void of being loved by a man. I never fully believed that this was indeed a fact, however, looking back I can\"t help but find some truth in it. How could I not? I was the perfect example of a woman that spent her whole life without her father and then wound up having a ridiculous amount of issues when it comes to dating.\n\nYou see, to this day I still have no recollection of memories that I share with my biological father. All I know is that, he was married to my mother when I was born and was around for the first couple of years of my life, until my mother joined the Army to try and improve our lives, that is. He, of course, hadn\"t wanted her to join but he also was unwilling to be the man in the family and join himself to take care of his family. So instead of him just letting her join since she was willing, he decided to give her an ultimatum, it was either him or the Army. With my mother being the headstrong woman that she is, she chose the Army.\n\nWhat makes it worse though, is that my sister and I didn\"t leave Georgia right away when our mother did, we stayed with our grandmother while our mother was stationed in Korea. Why couldn\"t I have lived with my father while my mother was gone? He didn\"t have to give up on me too just because my mother joined the Army. He could have been there for me and maybe I would have a better standard to hold a man to instead of just trying to figure it all out on my own now.\n\nThe door swung open and jolted me out of my thoughts.\n\n\"Hey baby,\" Eric said as he leaned in to kiss me.\n\n\"Hey babe, how was work?\" I responded.\n\n\"You know, same shit different day. So we still going to your grandma\"s house?\" he said as he searched through a pile of clothes to find an outfit for the day. I never understood how he was so content with wearing his clothes multiple times before washing them. It was disgusting.\n\n\"Yeah, I need to wash my clothes. So, you know if you don\"t want to stay you can just drop me off and go chill with your brother or something,\" I said hoping he would go along with my suggestion. I needed some time with my family without him so I could feel comfortable being myself for a while. I was also starving and I already knew my grandmother didn\"t care for Eric and hated when I would make him a plate of anything she cooked. She told me over and over again that she didn\"t make the food for him, it was for her grandchildren, but if I wanted to eat I had to make him a plate too or I wouldn\"t hear the end of it so I always did it anyway.\n\n\"Aight, bet. That\"s what I wanted to do anyway. Go smoke and play the game for a lil bit while you chill wit yo peoples,\" he agreed.\n\nI smiled to myself as I searched through my bag for something I could still fit. It was time to start planning my escape..\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "With Eric at work, I knew this was my chance to leave. I started by gathering any savings I had managed to keep from him, which wasn't much, just a few hundred dollars I had stashed away from my part-time job, hidden in a secret compartment of my makeup bag. I was also thankful that I had the foresight to keep my birth control on me, even though he had often berated me for using it and called it \"a way for women to avoid taking responsibility for their actions.\"\n\nMy heart raced as I slipped a pair of shoes on my swollen feet and gathered my essentials: a small backpack with some baby clothing, a change of clothes for both of us, and the most important item - my phone. I'd found it in the backyard last week when I was taking the trash out and had hidden it under a pile of leaves. It was my lifeline, not only for communication but also as a weapon in case Eric tried to stop me.\n\nI took a deep breath as I peeked out the window, checking to see if his car was still in the driveway. It wasn't. My pulse quickened; this was it. I had to act fast. I carefully opened the door, wincing at the creak it made, and slipped out, closing the door silently behind me. I kept low, moving from shadow to shadow, as I made my way across the yard and into the woods that bordered our property.\n\nThe forest was dark and foreboding, but I had no choice but to trust it to hide me from Eric's view. My breath came in ragged gasps as I trudged through the underbrush, the weight of my unborn child making every step a laborious effort. I couldn't think about how far I was going or how long this would take; I just had to keep moving.\n\nHours later, when I thought I couldn't go any farther, I stumbled onto a small, deserted cabin. It was a miracle, I thought, as I fell inside, exhausted. The inside was dusty and reeked of neglect, but it was better than being out in the cold with no shelter. I found an old blanket and made a nest on the floor, wrapping myself and my baby in its musty warmth.\n\nAs I lay there, catching my breath, I thought about how I had gotten here. I was intelligent, kind, and full of potential, yet I had let myself become a prisoner in my own life. The abuse had started small, verbal at first, then physical, but I had convinced myself it was my fault. If only I had been more understanding, more patient, maybe he wouldn't have hit me. But the reality was that no amount of compliance or love could stop someone intent on harming another.\n\nThe next morning, I awoke with a renewed sense of purpose. I had to find help, for myself and for my child. With a mix of determination and fear, I made my way back into the world, my footsteps stronger and more confident than before.\n\nI found a payphone and dialed the number for a domestic violence shelter. As I explained my situation to the woman on the line, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. She told me they could help, that they had a safe house where I could stay and get the support I needed. I had to leave my number and wait for a callback, but for the first time in what felt like forever, I had hope.\n\nThat evening, as I sat on the edge of the porch, watching the sun set, I thought about how different my life could be now. I could have a fresh start, a safe place for my child to be born, and most importantly, freedom. My eyes filled with tears again, but this time they were tears of relief and gratitude.\n\nThe next few days were a blur of logistics and fear. I had to be cautious, always looking over my shoulder, but the support I received from the shelter was incredible. They helped me get a new phone, arranged for medical care, and even set me up with a counselor to help me work through the trauma I had endured. Slowly but surely, I started to build a new life for myself and my son.\n\nLooking back, I realized that it wasn't just about leaving Eric; it was about leaving the person I had become in that relationship. It was about rediscovering my strength, my worth, and my dreams. And as I held my newborn son in my arms, I knew that I had done the right thing. I had saved both of us from a life of darkness and despair, and for that, I was eternally grateful.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text.

{"id": "text_completion_030", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: *São Paulo, Brazil. 12 million people jammed in tiny flats. Construction companies have managed to flatten most of the old São Paulo, and build a bigger, uglier one on top of it\"s rubble. It\"s hard to find any old buildings, and the government is indifferent towards the hunger of the construction conglomerates. Sometimes you can spot an old house here and there.\n\n\nThis is the story of one of this houses.*\n\nI swallowed my pride and went into the room, ready to listen. Lino was draped over his chair: lord of his two-by-three, chipboard-walled castle. I closed the door, making the walls shudder.\n\nSitting opposite Lino was an old man in a dark blue concierge\"s suit. The man\"s small, dark, speckled eyes were fixed on Lino, waiting for the answer to a question I hadn\"t been there to hear. I took a seat next to him.\n\n\"We\"ve got the solution to your problem,\" Lino said.\n\nI nodded. Solutions were good. The old man next to me was still looking at Lino, as if they were alone in the room. Maybe he\"d had a brain haemorrhage. Maybe they were in love.\n\n\"And what problem are we talking about?\" I said.\n\n\"You know.\" Lino would\"ve put his feet up on the table if there\"d been space, but he settled for stretching like an old, effeminate cat. \"In Consolação.\"\n\nSo I was right, it was my neck on the line. I spoke carefully, as if talking to a retarded child holding an AR-15.\n\n\"Lino, you know I\"ve done everything I could. Mrs Pederneiras doesn\"t want to move. I know it\"s been four-\"\n\n\"Six.\"\n\n\"Six, fuck, six months, whatever.\" I unbuttoned my shirt collar. \"I just wanted to make it clear I\"ve done what I could.\"\n\nLino looked at the archive box on top of the shelves. That was where he kept the files on his employees. Had my time come? I mentally calculated the redundancy payout I\"d get. What with the child maintenance and the payments on the car, I reckoned I\"d have enough to live off for about four months. It would go further if I wasn\"t still paying for the apartment Viviane took from me.\n\nHe lost interest in the box and lifted a pen to his mouth, chewing the end for what seemed like an age.\n\n\"This should be the city of the future, of enterprise, of tomorrow. It\"s Brazil\"s engine,\" Lino said, clamping the end of the pen between his teeth. \"Who cares about knocking down a little house in Brazil\"s engine?\" He held the pen up, emphasising his own words and showing his teeth. \"It\"s Brazil steamroller.\"\n\nI\"d forgotten about the old man next to me. He turned his head towards me, becoming aware of my presence for the first time.\n\n\"As Mr Lino said, we\"ve got the solution to your problem,\" said the old man.\n\nA hippie necklace was just visible underneath the old man\"s beige casual shirt. Little coloured stones on a thin thread. Where had I seen that before?\n\n\"You\"re going to demolish the house by mistake,\" the old man went on.\n\nLino smiled so wide I thought the skin stretched over his cheeks would split like a ripe tomato.\n\n\"You\"re going to take the guys there and demolish the house,\" said Lino, twisting the end of the pen between his fingers. \"When the police arrive, if they arrive, you say it was a mistake. It won\"t be your responsibility, it\"ll be the company\"s.\"\n\n\"And what about Mrs Pederneiras?\"\n\n\"She\"ll probably sue the company and get 300,000 in insurance out of us.\"\n\n\"The house is worth at least three times that.\"\n\n\"It\"s enough for an old woman.\"\n\n\"We\"ll get royally fucked in court, Lino.\"\n\n\"No we won\"t. I spoke to the judge about it at Cláudia\"s birthday last week. We\"re on the same page.\"\n\nMy gaze darted around the room. Such a brilliant and cruel idea could only be conceived in a construction company. I focused on the yellow plastic box.\n\nLino tapped the pen hard against the table, but not out of nerves.\n\n\"I\"m not going to do that,\" I said.\n\nLino raised the pen once more. His eyes lazily scanned the room until they came to rest on the yellow archive box that also held my attention.\n\n\"Mrs Pederneiras doesn\"t go out,\" I said.\n\nThe old man turned his chair. \"She\"s going out tonight. A family emergency. She\"ll be back tomorrow.\"\n\n\"She has family?\"\n\nThe old man turned his chair back to face Lino.\n\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" I said.\n\n\"Someone who wants all this to be over with.\"\n\nFor fuck\"s sake.\n\nPaulista was gridlocked. I took São Carlos do Pinhal, ignoring the roadsigns, I cut down Augusta, got onto Consolação.\n\nFor fuck\"s sake.\n\nI got out of the car in front of the plot of land. An enormous rectangle of kidney coloured ground, with a lonely little house halfway along the block. All of the surrounding neighbourhood had already been sold to the construction company and demolished, with considerable compensation. All except Mrs Pederneiras\"s house. I walked up to it, dirtying my khaki trousers with earth.\n\nIt was just another house with no personality or architectural value, like almost all the houses in São Paulo. A functional two-story block built for eating, eating, shitting. Lino was right, who cared about that piece of crap?\n\nI knocked because the bell didn\"t work. Mrs Pederneiras dragged herself to the door.\n\nShe was a pale old woman with eyes almost entirely hidden by the bags around them. Her hair was still dark and straight. She must have been getting on for ninety, a hundred. And even though she knew why I was there, she greeted me with a smile.\n\nJust like all the other times I\"d been to the house, she led me to the living room crammed full with trinkets, pictures, various worthless bits of rubbish. A whole life in odds and ends. We sat in the armchairs in the centre of the round sisal rug.\n\nI spoke unhurriedly. We talked about the weather, the traffic, the elections. It always took at least ten minutes of small talk before I could bring up any important issue with her. I\"m terrible at small talk, but with her didn\"t mind. We eventually ran out of inoffensive topics.\n\n\"Have you thought about the construction company\"s offer?\"\n\nMrs Pederneiras smiled an old woman\"s smile.\n\n\"How many times have you asked me that already?\"\n\n\"Three hundred,\" I replied, a reasonable approximation.\n\n\"And what have I always told you?\"\n\nShe watched me with the sincere superiority of someone who will not be moved. Or pushed. Mrs Pederneiras had held out for almost a year, even when they knocked down everything around her, when they left the motors running all night for a week on purpose, when the mortal remains of her ex-neighbourhood were carted off, covering her house with red dust for weeks. The old woman was a brick wall. No, not a wall. Lino could knock down a wall.\n\n\"You agree that we\"re in a stalemate here, don\"t you? The thing is that all this, this whole problem, is falling on my shoulders.\"\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n\"I understand that you don\"t want to move. Really I do. This is your home. But it\"s already been decided, by power\"s greater than you, you and I are nothing in this process, you know, we\"re tiny ants. We can kick and shout all we like and we\"ll still just be insects. The construction company is going to trample on us all the same.\" I brought my thumb and index finger together, squashing an invisible being: \"Tiny ants.\"\n\nAnd she sat there, smiling.\n\n\"I\"m pleading with you,\" I said, taking her bony hands in mine. \" I need this job,\" I whispered without meaning to.\n\nIt was true. Mrs Pederneiras left her hands there and fixed her eyes on me for a long moment.\n\n\"This might be the last time I come here, do you see? The construction company is losing patience.\"\n\nThe old woman fiddled with something at her neck. She looked around and tensed her arms, which were still muscular for her age and reminded me of the bricklayers I worked with every day. She checked the top button of her shirt. She adjusted her still-dark hair. She was getting ready to say something difficult.\n\n\"This is the first time you\"ve been honest with me.\"\n\n\"Don\"t talk like that, Mrs Pederneiras.\"\n\n\"So I\"m going to be honest with you.\"\n\nShe looked around the room, pensive. Then she dropped her gaze to the rug.\n\n\"This house mustn\"t move from here.\"\n\n\"The house?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The house mustn\"t move from here?\"\n\nThe old woman leant back in the chair, looking around her again.\n\n\"I look after the house. There has always been a house here.\"\n\n\"At this address?\"\n\n\"Since there have been people.\"\n\nI leant back in the chair, establishing a safe distance, as if senility was a dangerous gas leak that might blow my head apart at any moment.\n\n\"And you\"ve been here forever too?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nI got up.\n\n\"So this house, it\"s been here forever?\"\n\n\"Not this house. There were others before it. But there has always been a house, right here, on the spot. It\"s important that there\"s be a house here. Sit down.\"\n\nIt was an order, and I obeyed.\n\n\"My mother lived here. And her mother. When Isias Pederneiras arrived, he found a house already here. He was a bandeirante who crossed the Pacific with Manuel Preto. He killed everyone who lived here, except one. She showed him the importance of the house. And the two of them stayed there. There has been a house here ever since and there has always been somebody guarding the house. When my time is up, my son will take my place. And his son. And so on.\"\n\n\"And you can\"t leave here?\"\n\n\"I don\"t even know if it\"s possible. The house wouldn\"t allow it. The house has a purpose, and it can be dangerous when it needs to be.\"\n\nWould I end up like that as well? Alone and senile, still paying this ridiculous maintenance and hated by my daughter? I was unable to say anything else. It was too sad.\n\nThe old woman got up. She signalled for me to do the same and I obeyed. She walked to the corner of the room, bent over until her waist was at a right angle and effortlessly pulled back the edge of the round carpet, toppling two cane-seated chairs.\n\nIn a corner of the wooden floor there was a small round hole the size of a fist.\n\nMrs Pederneiras pointed at the hole.\n\n\"There\"s something down there. Something bad. It\"s as cunning as anything and is always trying to get out. The house has to be here to stop it getting out.\"\n\nIf Mrs Pederneiras had gone mad, we could get a legal impediment. I might be able to serve as witness. I needed to talk to Lino.\n\n\"Look,\" she said.\n\n\"In the hole?\"\n\n\"In the hole.\"\n\n\"There\"s no need, I believe you, honestly.\"\n\nShe stood still, her arm outstretched with a belligerent index finger pointing towards the small orifice in the floor.\n\nI looked at the hole. It was very dark. A current of air came up through it together with the smell of dry leaves, strong spices, animal fat.\n\n\"I can\"t see anything.\"\n\n\"Closer.\"\n\nI took a step towards the hole.\n\n\"Closer.\"\n\nI don\"t know why I knelt down. I moved my head towards the hole and a damp breeze rose to meet me. How deep was it? I still couldn\"t see anything.\n\nThen, the sound: nails scratching against concrete. I jumped back.\n\n\"Fuck, rats make that noise, it\"s full of rats down there, holy shit!\"\n\nI apologised for swearing, surely looking like a naughty little boy. The old woman had stopped smiling. She walked to the door and held it open, waiting for me to leave, with her chin pointing towards the street.\n\n\"Go on. You can tell your bosses.\"\n\nI righted the chairs. They were hardwood, heavy.\n\nBefore closing the door, she grabbed my sleeve.\n\n\"Things around here grow without ever questioning what there was before. And other things are in their places for a reason. Not everything is transitory like your people want it to be. Some things should never change. The house stays here. And I stay with the house.\"\n\nThe top button of the old woman\"s shirt had come undone and around her wrinkled neck I saw a string of coloured stones. It was the second time that day I\"d seen a necklace like that. And thinking carefully about it, it was the second time I\"d seen those small dark eyes.\n\nThe old woman did up her button and closed the door.\n\nI called the foreman and made sure everyone was on the alert. The team knew what was going to happen that night. A few trustworthy men, who weren\"t going to spill the beans if the law decided to muscle in.\n\nI waited on the other side of the road in my double cab Ranger, ready to demolish the memories of a senile old woman so as to keep my job and meet the payments on the car.\n\nAt least the money had been well spent because the Ranger had everything, including tinted windows which meant the old man in his concierge\"s suit couldn\"t see me when he pulled up in a taxi and led the woman out of the house.\n\nMrs Pederneiras held onto the roof of the car before the old man guided her inside. She looked me straight in the eyes, hurt and disappointment coming in through the glass, her gaze meeting mine head-on.\n\nI was invisible behind the glass. Even so, I had to control my desire to hide under the seat. Poor old woman.\n\nThe man gripped her shoulders and deposited her in the back seat. I read his lips: \"Come on, Mum.\"\n\nThey drove away, leaving behind them a cloud of red dust. I went to find the team at the far side of the plot of land.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. The continuation should be consistent with the original story in terms of plot, character development, and tone.\n2. Maintain coherence and logical progression in the storyline.\n3. Ensure the continuation is long enough to cover the necessary developments and messages.\n", "response": "The foreman waved at me as I approached, a thick-necked, sweat-glistened creature who had spent more time with a jackhammer than a woman. We exchanged nods and I told him to get the work started. The roar of the engines filled the air as the heavy machinery came to life in unison, the vibrations of the construction vehicles shaking the ground beneath us.\n\nA few minutes later, the first blows were struck. The sledgehammers swung, breaking the windows, shattering glass and echoing in the air. I wanted to look away, to shield my eyes from the destruction, but instead I forced myself to watch. It was my responsibility, and if Lino ever found out about this, it would be my neck on the line. I couldn’t run from it now.\n\nAs the workers began tearing down the walls, I noticed a small dog barking from across the street. It was a scrawny mutt, no bigger than a kitten, with an old, dirty collar around its neck. It barked and yapped at the men, its fear and anger mingling into a frenzied noise that cut through the sound of sledgehammers and bulldozers.\n\n“Get that damn thing out of here,” one of the workers shouted, and the foreman turned to me.\n\n“There’s nothing we can do about it,” he said. “We can’t have an animal here. It’s a dangerous place.”\n\nI nodded, but I couldn’t seem to take my eyes off the dog. It was small and pitiful, and it seemed like it was the last thing defending that old house. I pulled out my phone and called the local animal shelter, hoping they would come and take care of the dog. But as I waited for them to arrive, I realized they might not get there in time.\n\nThe bulldozers were getting closer to the little animal, and it was clear it didn’t understand the danger it was in. It was too small to be seen from a distance, too insignificant to be worth saving. And yet, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of guilt as I watched the workers get closer to it.\n\nJust then, a van pulled over on the sidewalk, and a group of protesters emerged, carrying signs and chanting slogans. They were demanding that the construction be stopped, that the old woman’s house be preserved. I recognized some of them as neighbors from the area, who had been fighting against the construction company for years. They were a ragtag group of activists, but they were determined.\n\n“You can’t do this!” one of them shouted at me. “This is a cultural heritage site!”\n\nI shook my head. “It’s not,” I said. “It’s just an old house.”\n\n“It’s a symbol of our city!” another protester yelled. “It represents our history and our identity!”\n\nI started to feel a little uneasy, a little defensive. The protest was growing bigger, and I knew that if it got out of hand, the construction could be stopped and I could lose my job. I turned to the foreman.\n\n“Get them out of here,” I said. “Use whatever means necessary.”\n\nThe foreman nodded and gestured to the workers, who began to move towards the protesters. They formed a shield wall around the construction site, blocking the protesters from getting any closer. The dog barked and yapped, but it was clear that it was no match for the machines of destruction that surrounded it.\n\nAs I watched the protesters being pushed back, I realized that I had become a part of this. I had become one of the tools of the construction company, willing to do whatever it took to get the job done. And yet, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of regret, a sense that I was contributing to the loss of something precious, something irreplaceable.\n\nAs the workers continued to tear down the walls, I looked around at the empty plots of land that surrounded us. It was a wasteland, a graveyard of old buildings and memories, a place where history had been forgotten and replaced with the sterile, soulless structures that the construction company was building. And yet, as I watched the bulldozers and cranes at work, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of hope that this place, this city, could be revitalized, that it could be given a new life, a new purpose.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had started, the construction came to a halt. The engines of the machines died down, leaving behind a silence that was almost eerie. The workers looked at each other, confused, and I turned to see what had happened.\n\nAcross the street, the old woman had returned. She was standing in front of the bulldozers, her face set in a determined expression, her hands clasped in front of her. The workers looked at her, unsure of what to do.\n\n“Stop!” she shouted. “Stop this!”\n\nThe foreman turned to me, his face a mix of frustration and fear. “What do we do?” he asked.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. The old woman was elderly and fragile, but she was also determined, and she had a strength that I couldn’t help but feel awed by. And yet, I couldn’t let her stop the construction. I couldn’t let her stop progress.\n\n“Ignore her,” I said. “We have a job to do.”\n\nThe foreman nodded and gestured to the workers, who turned their machines back on. But the old woman didn’t move. She stood there, a solitary figure in front of the machines of destruction, refusing to let them pass.\n\nI watched as the workers and the foreman got out of their trucks, trying to reason with the old woman, trying to convince her to move. But she wouldn’t budge. She stood there, a symbol of resistance, a testament to the importance of history and heritage.\n\nAnd then, something unexpected happened. The protesters who had been pushed back earlier began to move forward, joining the old woman in her fight to save the house. They formed a line in front of the bulldozers, blocking their path, refusing to let them continue.\n\nThe workers looked at each other, unsure of what to do. The foreman turned to me, his face a mask of panic and confusion.\n\n“What do we do?” he asked.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t let the construction be stopped, but I also couldn’t let the old woman and the protesters be hurt. I had a feeling that this situation was going to spiral out of control, and I didn’t want to be caught in the middle.\n\nBut then, just as I was about to tell the foreman to stop the construction, something else happened. The construction workers began to turn their machines off again. They looked at each other, their faces filled with confusion and uncertainty.\n\n“What’s going on?” one of them asked.\n\nThe foreman looked around, his face a mask of fear and confusion. “I don’t know,” he said. “But I think we need to stop.”\n\nThe workers looked at each other, their faces filled with confusion and uncertainty. And then, one of them spoke up.\n\n“We can’t do this,” he said. “We can’t destroy something that’s important to people.”\n\nThe other workers nodded in agreement, and the foreman looked at me, his face a mask of surprise and confusion.\n\n“What do we do now?” he asked.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. I had become a part of this, and now I couldn’t let it go. But I also couldn’t continue with the construction. I had made a mistake, and now I needed to make it right.\n\n“We need to stop,” I said.\n\nThe foreman nodded, and the workers began to turn off their machines. The protesters and the old woman looked at each other, their faces filled with relief and gratitude. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the construction came to a halt.\n\nAs I watched the workers pack up their equipment and leave, I realized that I had made a mistake. I had become a part of this, and now I couldn’t let it go. But I also couldn’t continue with the construction. I had made a mistake, and now I needed to make it right.\n\nI walked over to the old woman, who was still standing in front of the bulldozers, her face filled with relief and gratitude.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I said. “I shouldn’t have let this happen. I should have known better.”\n\nThe old woman looked at me, her face filled with forgiveness and understanding.\n\n“It’s okay,” she said. “We all make mistakes. As long as we learn from them and move forward.”\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of relief and gratitude that I had never felt before. And as I watched the construction site empty out, I realized that I had become a part of something bigger than myself. I had become a part of this city’s history, and I felt a sense of pride and purpose that I had never felt before.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text.

{"id": "text_completion_031", "instruction": "You should write a continuation of the following story.\n[Story]: I no longer can handle this house that I once called home. The plain white walls with the judgmental eyes. They have long since made me feel quite uncomfortable. My ears ache with such pain from the loud squeaky floor boards. I have yet to decide if they are begging me for help or screaming at me to leave. The shredded green carpet, upstairs in the last bedroom at the end of the hall, to the left, must truly despise me. I say this because when I walk into that room the carpets dark, green hands always wrap around my feet causing me to fall. I am afraid to take simple baths in the once peaceful tub, in the upstairs bathroom. Every time I get into the water and scooch down in it to get comfortable and relax, the water comes back on once I rest my eyes. I always feel the hands of someone trying to drown me. My only friend was the wall size mirror in my living room. It has the most welcoming presence and the most beautiful blue frame. I use to be able to look into it and see myself, the positive and happy self I use to be before…before all of this. Now it too has since betrayed me. It portrays me as this crazy, delusional person my family says I am. They say I am losing my mind but I am not. They say I am just the most, clumsy person they have ever met and that is why I trip over the carpet all the time. They even have an explanation for the bathtub. They say I fall asleep once I get too comfortable and that is why I feel like I am drowning. If only they could see the warning on the back of the front wooden door, just below the diamond shaped window. How they miss it I will never know. The blood is everywhere.\n\n\nMy name is Stephanie Grey. The year is 1997 and I am twenty-five years old. I have been living in this house for almost two years now. Before I moved to the peaceful town of New Seal, I lived in a very busy city. I was a very successful psychologist. I had a husband for about three years. We started dating when I was seventeen years old. Basically we were together for about six years. We lived together for four of those years. By now I am sure you are wondering why I continue to speaking in pass tense when referring to my husband. Well that is because in 1995 Gerald passed away. He was in a head on collision with another car. They both crashed into a guard rail. Everyone died involved including the little girl that was with her mother in the other car. I was completely devastated about this for a long time. Had my husband and I not been arguing then none of it would have happened.\n\nI stopped showing up to work and eventually lost my job. I didn't even care. After living with such depression for almost five months, I decided in order to be happy again I needed to move on. I knew the only way that I would be able to do this is, that I would have to move out of the house that I shared with my late husband. I didn't want to let go of the house I lived in for over four years but I knew I must be strong. That is how I ended up in this house that I have now.\n\nI found this house in a catalog. The description they gave was \"a beautiful, three bedroom, one and half bathrooms, a large front and backyard and two car garage. A great house for a large family looking for a peaceful and safe place to live.\" Now I know it doesn't make much sense for one person to move into a house so big. What caught my attention most about this house was that it was the only one that had the words \"peaceful and safe\" in its description. The thought of that sounded so wonderful to me and I figured if nothing else I could have a lot of sleep overs. Maybe even rent out the rooms to people and make some extra money, since I lost my job. I called the number listed for the home and moved in about two and a half weeks later.\n\nThe house was exactly as they said it was for the first year. The fresh air and the children playing in the street, brought more smiles to my face than I could count. I through parties often for my family and friends. I would invite the new people I had met since moving to this town. It was great and before I knew it I was back to how I once was. Although I missed my husband more than anything because he was my best friend, I was no longer sad. I have finally moved on and felt like I could be happy again. At least that is what I thought, till things started changing and the house became unfriendly.\n\nIt started out small, little things that had to happen several times before I even noticed them happening. My family always told me I was oblivious to the obvious. I figured out that, that is the only thing they have ever accused me of and they were right. Never have I ever met someone who doesn't notice when their chairs were rearranged or that their kitchen garbage was moved about three feet to the left and angled differently than they put it. I figured I simply forgot that I moved them and that was it. It didn't occur to me that something strange was happening until I started seeing the figures walking in the halls. I could never get a good enough look at them though, so I eventually started to dismiss them too.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The air felt suffocating, the once comforting silence now a heavy presence that pressed against her very soul.\n\nEach night, as the moon's light painted ghostly shadows on the walls, she would hear the soft sounds of footsteps, the muffled whispers that seemed to speak directly to her heart. It wasn't the fear of the unknown that disturbed her most, but the familiarity of the voices that whispered her name.\n\nOne evening, as she stood in front of the mirror, eyes wide and heart pounding, she noticed a figure standing right behind her - a silhouette that was eerily similar to Gerald. The mirror no longer reflected her image; instead, it showed her the reality of her surroundings. The house was filled with the restless spirits of those who had once lived there, bound by a tragic end.\n\nStephanie knew she needed help. She rummaged through Gerald's old things and found an old, tattered book on the supernatural, its pages yellowed with age. With trembling hands, she began to read, seeking guidance on how to appease these spirits and find peace.\n\nShe decided to reach out to the spirits, speaking to them with a voice that was both pleading and determined. \"Please, if you're here for a reason, show yourselves to me. I beg of you, tell me what you want, and I will do my best to help.\"\n\nThe response was immediate. Whispers grew louder, the floorboards creaked in a rhythm that seemed to spell out a message. She followed the sound, her feet moving without her consent, leading her to the last bedroom upstairs. The door, once white, now tinged with a dark stain that seemed to bleed through the wood.\n\nShe pushed open the door, and a cold, musty air greeted her. The room was bathed in a soft, ethereal light that seemed to come from nowhere. In the center of the room, a table sat with a single, flickering candle upon it. Around the table, chairs were arranged as if waiting for someone to take their seats.\n\nStephanie approached the table, her breath forming clouds in the chilled air. Upon the table, an old letter lay open, its ink faded but still legible. The words were from Gerald, penned in his distinctive script, dated the day before the accident.\n\n\"My dearest Steph, if you're reading this, it means I am gone. Know that I will always love you, and I will watch over you from beyond. This house... it holds memories of us, of the life we built together. I want you to find happiness again, to live without me, but never forget the love we shared. The spirits that haunt this place are not malevolent. They are lost souls, seeking peace just as you are. Help them, and in doing so, you will find your own.\"\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Stephanie picked up the letter, reading it once more before pressing it to her heart. She understood now; her husband's spirit had been trying to guide her all along, helping her to find the strength to move on.\n\nDetermined to honor Gerald's last wish, Stephanie began to help the other spirits in the house find peace. She organized a séance in the same room, inviting the local priest and a medium who specialized in such matters. Together, they managed to communicate with the spirits, learning their stories, and offering them the closure they needed to pass on.\n\nAs the final spirit found its peace and departed, the changes in the house became obvious. The walls, once cold and judgmental, now felt warm and welcoming. The floorboards ceased their cruel creaking, the mirror reflected her image clearly once more, and the carpets no longer ensnared her feet.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't the house that needed changing, but Stephanie herself. Through confronting her fears and honoring the love of her late husband, she found the strength to rebuild her life. The house, once a place of grief and isolation, became a sanctuary of healing and hope.\n\nWith a heart full of love and newfound purpose, Stephanie Grey continued her journey towards happiness, knowing that Gerald's spirit was with her every step of the way.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The continuation maintains narrative coherence with the preceding text, ensuring consistency in plot, character development, tone, and pacing.

{"id": "text_completion_032", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Mystery\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Only Sam and I know where Orson is.\n\n\nOnly Sam believes where Orson is.\n\nI talked with him, yes. I don't know how I managed to at last. Refusing or accepting wasn't going to work without that I assume, I remember that. It hadn't for a while now. I think about nine months. That's a bit odd to say… I also should mention I don't know if I will continue speaking with him like you suggested. Instead of that advice, I am taking the writing one again, about… about the why and the where, about where Orson is and what happened to him before all that and of course my feelings, for the same purpose of talking with Sam, which I think you'll appreciate. We'll see how it'll turn out…\n\n\n\nOrson gave me the 8 shaped necklace before he told me about the Osiris program. I was too worried about the idea of the baby being born an eight month like the doctor had said. Especially when the baby had pieced together the last unfixed pieces of our marriage. It was starting to affect my sleep, so, of course his too. He gave me the necklace after that. He said there was nothing we could do and it was time that was going to decide what was going to happen, and so that the only way we would be okay was that if we embraced it instead of refusing what was happening. And also after the 8 months he would give me another gift he promised. Like a charm, it worked. I put the 8 on my neck right then and didn't take it off whenever I did whatever. It's still on my neck, you probably seen it many times. After that, I asked him if he embraced it too. He confirmed it and I proposed we get him one too then. He declined on the account that there was no need. His way of showing how he was embracing it was different. That's when he told me he had accepted to go to the Osiris program.\n\nI wasn't happy with it but I couldn't blame him. This was a part of his character I had accepted, after I had scarred him with the way I was which had led to the divorce, which was cancelled thanks to him, in the cost of a slight change of his character. Some kids decide to do his jobs because it's so interesting and meticulous, his reason was to get away from home. He became that way after the cancellation of the divorce. As far as possible.\n\nHe went to the first Osiris Program with Sam who had already signed up for the second. It was the first Osiris route in their department, meaning they were the firsts which was pumping me up full of angst but before he went, he told me it'd be alright. He told me it was just another exploration mission around a station that was placed in Osiris. That was the idea which was giving me hope. Only after hearing it was just an exploration program I managed to cling on to that hope that everything would be fine when he came back. And explorations were never long, this one was assumed to be exactly seven months which was convenient for us.\n\nYou could imagine my surprise, or whatever word there is for what I was, when he returned thirty-two months later. It was seven months in Osiris time, not Earth... The mission wasn't just an exploration. It was an exploration of a time dilation source in Osiris.\n\nYou could also imagine his surprise when he saw his wife with more wrinkles, a few more health issues and a straight stomach. And also the baby room which was on a course to returning back to an office room. Selling the crib had taken me a lot of time and effort. It was a lazy and a slow course, but by his return it definitely looked more like an office than a baby room.\n\nThat's how and when his time perception issues had started. Also the green room incidents.\n\n\n\nI'd refuse the fact that I was not sleeping anymore. I was thinking that in any moment I could go to sleep, so I didn't get out of bed. But, now I'll say that was only because I wasn't accepting that my Orson was having issues. Again, now I can say that if you are going to refuse, you have to accept first… That's how those days were going and that's how I realized he wasn't sleeping, was out of the bed. Me refusing the fact that I wasn't sleeping meant I was staring at the ceiling for hours. Didn't make a difference. One of those days I woke up and saw he wasn't there. Like you said, I was trying to give him some space, some time, and I did, for a week until I couldn't. He was doing it every single day. His situation was exacerbating and space and time wasn't really helping him. I failed accepting that, and also I was at the point where I was starting to put the blame on him for the way he was.\n\nMy desire was too tangible I guess so that I woke up at the middle of the night.\n\nI turned to the kitchen first, thinking he might be smoking or eating or whatever. He wasn't. There was a light coming from the baby's room. From the office rather. A green light. A weird feeling of refusal accompanied me on my walk there.\n\nThe first thing that captured my eye when I entered the room was the density. The whole room was swarmed with that dense green light. It took me a while to for some reason to understand that he had changed the bulb to green. And then only after a second or two I realized Orson was crouched and was leaning back to the side wall, just sitting there. In all honesty, it was one of the scariest moments of my life. The strength sapped away from my legs; my knees buckled. It was that day when I had thought that Orson was gone, MY Orson. I remember thinking what happened to MY Orson, as if the man I knew had gone somewhere. And I couldn't change that. It became a daily routine of mine from until that day to ask myself every time I saw him where Orson was. Still wonder it. Change is a scary thing. Time is a scary thing Jan.\n\nI asked him all kinds of questions, why had he changed the lightbulb to green like that, what he was doing, why he was doing it, and many more. He answered everything with the same answer, told me he was just \"passing the time\". Nothing else came out of his mouth that meant something different.\n\nNext four weeks were exactly the same. He'd wake up at night, go to the green room. Sit there. I never saw him in the bed when I woke up in all of that time period. After numerous fights on the verge of getting physical, I quit chasing him to there, I didn't know what to do. I was just watching the time drift by, not anything else. I woke up, wondered where Orson was. Not the one in the green room, my Orson. That was it.\n\nThen, in the first of the month, one morning he was. In bed I mean. Wasn't sleeping. I woke up and he was up sitting on the feet end, his back turned to me. You know when you'd somehow know something was going on even when you were asleep? That's what woke me up that day. I woke up, I saw him sitting like that and I knew something was going to take a turn for the worst somehow. I called for him and he replied right away. Said he wanted to try again…\n\n\n\nNow, as you know, I didn't want that. I never wanted that. But I never got to fully explain my reasoning to you.\n\nUntil that day he was refusing everything, he had even suggested moving… It was feeling like everything was the same, and everything was a part of that; a bland blurry unity of something. It didn't change the issue at hand. The problem we talked about for me was the same for him back then. It was a clear-cut quandary between acceptance and refusal. And I was still wearing the 8. But his totem of acceptance was long outdated; he was back from Osiris, and he needed a new one.\n\nI couldn't deter him. He refused. He refused accepting the situation. And he was asking for a new totem for refusing; a new baby.\n\nWell… I didn't know what to make of it. I had felt like MY Orson was really, really gone and this man was trying to be there instead of him. It was as if he was trying to fill a shell of our old life with the current one.\n\nLooking back, I don't want to get on his throat like I wanted to back then, especially when I think about the old me and what I did. I am not judging him, not just judging... Perhaps this is me trying to handle my end. Or just trying to figure out where my Orson is.\n\nShe scratched her chest, underneath where the 8 is. Until it got red, then swapped the scratch with a sting feeling.\n\n\n\nThen we got into it. For hours, days, weeks. Fights, long silences that extended to hours, crying -all me, curses and demeaning remarks all over. I did everything in my power to revert his ask, his need but he didn't back down. It wasn't a conscious attempt; he was like that. Silent, immutable. Beat me into being the same way after a while...\n\nAfter our clash became a stillness conflict, he was showing signs of distress and trauma again. That's when I told him with the last ounce of character I had left. The only way to move forward was that if we accepted our situation. And only time had the say on what was going to happen. He only agreed on the second part. He kept insisting we try again.\n\nThis went on for a while like I said.\n\nAfter hitting brick walls we moved onto more direct points. He was becoming less eloquent at these points in axiomatic fashion which was really disturbing me, I became aware of the situation enough to pull some of my punches. Even though I was clear on the fact that I didn't want to try again.\n\nSo I told him. I told him that a new supply of hope could be destructive for us. Things might go the same way again and we might not be able to accept it this time.\n\nTo this he only said the thing. Just time alone is fabricated hope. What we will have is real hope.\n\nHe explained why he said this for about three hours that day. The most he had talked.\n\nHis main point was time. And I know this wasn't supposed to mean anything to me. Time was the reason he was sick you said, I know that. But his points remained solid in my head. He said just time was fabricated hope. Was it not? We were not doing anything except leaning back onto time, hoping someday it was all going to fix itself, as if it was time's job to fix things. Everything would persist to be the same if nothing changed. And time -time changing- for us, that wasn't enough change after that point. Once something happens like this, you forget everything you know. Or worse, you quit believing in them. All that intrigues you becomes what you don't know, so, you lean on time and what its unending stretch will bring to you. You squeeze hope into what you don't know. You fabricate hope in mystery, uncertainty, blank. Because what you know denies hope.\n\nI think about that a lot. Since he is gone, I think about it a lot, even more than I did back then. And back then, it made me think \"will this bring my Orson back?\" This was becoming visible for him I suppose, because he told me he didn't want to affect my decision to that much a degree. He went to Sam for a few days that week, which I didn't care about at the time. I knew it was partly because of my fits too… Well, that's what it all did for me, affected my thinking even more. Just time is fabricated hope, I couldn't think much about else.\n\nHe returned a few days later. We tried again. I thought of my Orson.\n\nTime wasn't slowed down for the first time that night after a month of stillness. The night wasn't frozen and the other side of the bed wasn't cold, as if frozen too. There wasn't a green light on the hall. And those were the days when we were only arguing about the decision. I thought to myself it would bring my Orson back if we decided to refuse what had happened to us, refused the stillness of time and the hope and the pointless drifting in it. I thought nothing changes if nothing changes. The very morning of the night we tried again, we went to the doctor to see. Doctor said I was pregnant. The very night of that morning was when the night I woke up and saw the green light seeping onto the corridor again.\n\nThat's was the day I signed in to see you Jan, alone.\n\nI felt the time's fabric changing when I stepped toward the green room. It slowed down with heaviness, smothered the brain with its rotted smell of sense.\n\nI saw him sleeping on the carpet in the room and stepped in as the frantic rage controlled me. A ravenous scream to the man I didn't know, the man that was supposed to be MY Orson but wasn't, spit itself out my mouth. I yelled at him, I was mad at him as if he knew where my Orson was, as if he was a messenger to him. \"Why the hell are you here again?\" Because he was there instead of Orson…\n\nHe said he was having trouble sleeping near me. Now I think it was because of the baby. The reason I think that is connected to the time he wanted to go to the Osiris. We've had a talk about why he was wanting to go, before the divorce risks had surfaced. About the real reason he wanted to go.\n\nEssentially, he was nervous about the baby's birth. More than me. This was gradually transforming into an actual issue back at the time, he was having trouble maintaining his composure. On top of this, he was wanting to go for a program for a while, I think this was due to our violent disagreements and also the prior talks of having a baby way before we decided. I suppose I gave him enough excuse by doing some things I don't want to mention, he told me that he thought it was a good idea to go. I didn't view that as irresponsible, uncaring or anything of the sort. In fact, I thought it was responsible in a concurrently hateful way, since I had accepted his character to be that, the kind that avoided problems, but he was doing something to palliate it. Yes.\n\nSo, that's another reason he went to the Osiris Program while we were expecting. And to come back to the reason why he was sleeping on the green room instead of sleeping with me in the bed is that I believe he wasn't dealing with the stress of the coming baby. That's just who he is, that's what I'll say now. Some husbands watch sports to relieve themselves, to have comfort, some of them do sports, a few work and few buy shiny things for their wives. He prefers to put distance between him and the problem, move away as much as he can to move on. This is the first reason I believe for his decision to sleep in the green room. The second one is in the rest of his answer to my question that night.\n\nHe went on with his answer. That was another odd one to listen to. He told me that it reminded him of his time in Osiris. There was not much stuff on the room, it was virtually empty, also green. So, he told me that it gave him some comfort, it relaxed him, freed him you know? It made me mad again. I didn't understand it at the time. I didn't yell the second time though, just asked him what was in that room that he valued so much, explained that I couldn't understand it. Obviously it was about the baby. The first one. That's not how he said it of course.\n\n\"Time\" he said. \"There is time in there. Free, quiet and aging time… It helps me sleep…\"\n\nStill bothers me. Bothers me more actually when I think about what it means. I now know that I didn't get what he meant when he said that back then. Still, I understood it enough to get that his situation was becoming worse. It was sufficient to realize that he was viewing my pregnancy as if it was for the first baby. As if I was going to give birth to the baby that we have lost…\n\nThis notion became clearer and was confirmed when we began discussing the baby's name which he wanted to be Rhea. The name we had picked for the first baby.\n\nJust like before, I thought of it again. Maybe this will help me find my Orson I thought. Because briefly, the question about Orson's whereabouts seemed to have somewhat of an answer; the past.\n\nShe scratched the spot under her 8 necklace… The urge to scratch it kept accruing as her fingernails brushed back and forth on it. She pressed the cold plate of the necklace on the itch with significant force for a momentary relief, enough force for the 8 to leave a mark on the skin.\n\nHer gaze reeled in on the mark, then fixated on it as it started unhurriedly waning. The red fading away, leaving behind small spots of contact indications that were eventually going to fade away too. She continued staring at the spot for a while.\n\nI didn't know what to do with that. It was a scary thing to process. Something a normal people wouldn't say or think or offer. Besides, nothing was to change in my opinion. I wasn't viewing the issue in the same manner. No one should have. I refused the old name. Back at me he came of course, he didn't accept the new one. Like that, we snowballed into a cycle of disagreements. In the back of my mind I was hopeful still, subordinate to the coming of the baby. My thinking was that the severeness of this situation of his would abate as the time flowed. My Orson would come back that way. The issue with that was some things did not do that.\n\nMy pregnancy signs were stalling.\n\nFor the first nine weeks, not one symptom, whether it was puking, morning sickness, cravings, back pain, bleeding or breast swelling was introduced to me. And these are mostly fifth week signs. The only ones that I had were fatigue and headaches, which nor me or Orson thought was strong enough evidence to connect to the pregnancy. We went to the doctor after these -I went. He was in the green room and I didn't want him to come anyway.\n\nThe doctor notified me that all seemed and late signs were somewhat common. I told all this to Orson but he couldn't make himself believe them. He hadn't told me this but it was evident by his mannerism and everything. And like the baby name situation, I was once again proved to be valid on my thoughts by the next milestone of his exacerbation; the nailing of the windows of the green room with wood planks and painting the room the old color.\n\nBy the time he was all into it, the only thing I managed to get out of him as for the reason was he said the need for using the green room in the morning as well.\n\nLike that, this person that was supposed to be my Orson was getting farther and farther away from that. His personality had already left the shell, his appearance was doing the same, going farther away from the first place, just like my Orson had. Where was my Orson, where was this guy going? Was he going to come back with the baby?\n\nThe rest of every question or attempt at conversing with him was returned to by nods, shakes of the head, blinks either for approval or saying no, and that sort of thing.\n\nShe paused for a moment. Something made her. Perhaps a thought or a feeling or an instinct.\n\nThe passing of time, it was the only thing taking place. The light kept illuminating the paper. The paper kept standing on the desk. Sound of the wind continued accompanying her. Small trickles of the rain remained trickling. The simple and uncomplicated realization accommodated her mind. It was all this that made her pause, in the middle of a thought she was putting to words. She rested her ears at the sounds, and her gaze at the sights contemplatively.\n\nI thought to myself those days that when the baby came, there'd be no reason for us not to move on. Every day there opened an occasion fit for me to tell this to myself. I tried many times to tell it to him too but to no avail of course. Things continued as we waited for the baby. There was not a single beam of light entering the green room from the outside. There was not a single time when he joined me in the bed. The weeks slowed again. I felt as though I was being pulled and pushed constantly to the past -along with him- to the moment when we got the news of the first baby. The bad news. The first eleven weeks passed like this, slow and heavy.\n\nThen I finally started puking. Puked. Wanted strange good. Nausea too. Things were so off the rails; Orson was so off the rails that I was not expecting any of the good reactions once I had from him to my signs. Rightly so; he doubled the boards on the green room to fully shut the light. This said light was maybe merely enough to unveil some dust in the air… Then he started building a cradle, didn't move the office desk though. I protested but then he would stutter and sometimes hit his head with his palm, he would say he was sorry, he would try to kiss me to apologize but it would be a weird, blank and debt kind of a kiss you know? And he wasn't doing all this in panic mode or anything. That made it all the more difficult to bear it. He seemed like Orson but wasn't. Then he bought clocks. More clocks. For the wall and both his wrists. He bought more bulbs, green ones of course. These things dragged on until my puking stopped, my cravings grew, and in general my pregnancy advanced. He bought more bulbs, more clocks, more boards.\n\nThose didn't stop… Every other week I woke up and the green light seeping into the corridor would be denser and more obvious as the baby came closer. I would literally hear the ticking of the clocks from the hall. Sometimes along with the sound of a hammer hitting boards. Or maybe the paint brushing the same-colored walls.\n\nAt the first day of the eighth month, he was at his strangest. The number of the clocks and green bulbs and the painting was at their highest. He was too energetic and too anxious. I remember finding it strange that he was trying to stay out of the green room that day. He'd mostly fail and jump back in and come out for a few minutes, rub my stomach and go back in with an apology. He literally did that for the whole day with random intervals. I heard him crying at the green room from the bed at night. And when I woke up in the morning, there was no green light spilling into the hall. He was gone.\n\nThat's it…\n\n\n\nSo, I talked to you. I talked to Sam. I talked to myself.\n\nI didn't really talk to Sam actually, Sam talked to me. I got his letter few months earlier.\n\nIn his letter, he mentioned how Orson had gone to see him in August. That was the 8th month of the pregnancy. He mentioned how Orson had asked him whether he was handling the PTSD about the time difference adaptation, and how Orson looked like he wasn't. He mentioned he looked off, unstable, worrying that day. He said but everything is well, he is with me. We'll have some time off. He'll be better after a few years.\n\nI mentioned that Sam had signed up for the second route.\n\nThat's it.\n\nSo, where is Orson?\n\nI know it. Sam knows it. Better than both of us, time knows it.\n\nShe scratched her chest once again before taking the 8 necklace out. Her gaze fixated on the 8. Puking, nausea, cravings related to things more important than food, headaches… She rotated the eight sideways. A longer stare continued itself on the sideways eight. For a long, stretched, slow burning nine seconds, which she hadn't intended for.\n\nShe recounted what he said in the voice message he had sent her before the day he arrived\n\n\"We, uh, we went into the station and there uh… It was in there.\"\n\nShe stared at him\n\n\"It was all green. It was moving and contorting, and spilling. And flowing.\"\n\nShe continued staring in bewilderment.\n\n\"It was time in there. I could feel it moving, alive. I felt it on my skin and my vision, my hair and my eyelashes and my breath. It touched and pierced everything in it. I could feel it flowing, and growing and shrinking at the same time. It was moving. And I was getting older, faster than normal. I could feel it, I felt it. It was hard to track it, impossible maybe actually. Yes. Time moved faster in there, in that green room.\"\n\n\"And if it wasn't for that place, I don't know how I could endure being away from you for such a long time. But it felt like only a couple of days to me.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Mystery.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In the quietude of the night, I found myself sitting on the edge of the bed, clutching the 8-shaped necklace that Orson had given me. It was the last gift he would give me, he had said—or so he had implied before he left. I wondered if he'd even remember that promise now, as his absence had stretched into years, turning the promise into a whisper of the past.\n\nThe story of Orson and I had begun with the sweet anticipation of a child, a promise of new life to come. But then, Orson spoke of the Osiris program, an exploration mission around a station situated in Osiris—or so he had said. The mission was supposed to last seven months, a mere blink in the grand tapestry of time. Yet, when he returned, thirty-two months had passed on Earth, and in Orson, time had left visible imprints—wrinkles, a few more health issues, and a change in mannerisms.\n\nIt was then that the green room incidents began. I found Orson sitting in a room painted entirely green, his back to the wall, a green light illuminating the space. It was a sight that chilled my blood, for in that moment, I felt as though I was losing Orson to an unknown abyss, a man who was slipping away from me bit by bit.\n\nOur relationship became a battleground, with Orson insisting on trying again for another child, a decision I couldn't fathom, given the emotional toll it had taken on us. The more he pushed, the more I resisted, until our relationship frayed into silence and resentment. \n\nOne night, as I lay in bed, the green light seeping into the corridor awakened me. I stumbled into the room, to find Orson sitting on the floor, his back to me. It was then that he revealed to me the truth of his time in Osiris—a place where time was not linear, but a contorting, flowing entity that had pierced him, marking him in ways that were visible and invisible. He spoke of the green room as a sanctuary, a place where he could feel time moving, growing, and shrinking simultaneously.\n\nHis words resonated with me, for in them, I saw the mystery of Orson's absence—a man trapped in a place where time behaved in ways beyond our understanding, a place where he had sought refuge from the pain of our lost child. \n\nAs I sit here, clutching the 8-shaped necklace, I realize that the mystery of Orson's whereabouts, the reason for his absence, lies not in the physical world, but in the labyrinth of his own mind, in the green room where time flows in ways we cannot comprehend. The truth is not to be found in the tangible, but in the intangible—in the memories, in the stories, in the echoes of a love that transcends the boundaries of time and space.\n\nOnly Sam and I know where Orson is, for the truth lies in the heart of the mystery, in the green room where time flows freely, and in the love that binds us all.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures some stylistic elements and emotional resonance but lacks the intricate, fragmented narrative style and the depth of psychological complexity present in the original.

{"id": "text_completion_033", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Speculative Fiction\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: I remember waking up in a hospital bed wearing a surgical gown. I knew my name, Alvin. I even knew that my \"friends\" called me Al. I just couldn't remember any of them.  I tried to envision their faces, but it was all blank.\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\"Mr. Northcutt. I'm here to check your vitals.\" A person said as they entered my room, looking at a holographic image that appeared to be my vital signs.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" He asked.\n\n\"Pretty good.\" I responded. \"Except I can't remember anything.\"\n\nHe smiled, \"The procedure was a success.\" He waved his fingers through the air as more charts and graphs appeared. \"That's good.\"\n\n\"Procedure?\" I asked.\n\n\"My name is Dr. Patel.\" He said, pulling up a stool to sit beside me. \"And you've underwent a procedure to help you recover from severe trauma.\"\n\nI would have been nervous, except I couldn't remember any trauma. I wasn't sure if he was telling me the truth.\n\n\"This is a military hospital. And you were deployed for years. And this process is to reintegrate you into society.\"\n\n\"I'm in the military?\" I asked.\n\n\"You were in the military.\" He answered. \"For the past few months you've been here… recovering.\"\n\nThere was a chime overhead and the doctor stood up. \"Later today there will be some staff members visiting you to explain everything.\"\n\nHe made a few final gestures into the holographic system and then looked back at me, \"Welcome home.\"\n\nI sat in bed for the rest of the day watching old television shows on holographic television. The technology was amazing, mostly because I couldn't remember when it was invented. The food was also excellent, despite being a hospital setting.\n\nLater in the afternoon a group of people entered the room dressed in military clothing.\n\n\"Al, it's good to see you.\" A middle-aged man with a crew cut said smiling.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't remember you.\" I responded.\n\n\"I know. That's normal. We've all been through it.\" He said, and then gestured to his colleagues, \"My name is Paul Hughes, and this is one of your other friends Marcus Salvatore, and this lovely lady is your ex-wife Koren Matthews.\n\n\"Ex-wife?\" I said, surprised.\n\n\"Don't worry we're still friends.\" She said smiling.\n\nShe didn't look familiar. I didn't feel anything other than staring at a complete stranger.\n\n\"Do we have any kids?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, not in our line of work.\" She answered.\n\nThey all pulled up stools and sat around me. I could sense that they weren't here to visit me or check on my health. They wanted something else.\n\n\"You've been here for a long time. How are you feeling?\" Paul asked, feigning empathy.\n\n\"I feel fantastic. I would say I've never felt better, but I can't remember anything.\" I responded.\n\nThey all seemed very pleased with my response.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" Marcus asked me.\n\n\"I have no idea. But judging from my accent I'd guess somewhere in the Midwest?\" I answered.\n\n\"Do you remember?\" My ex-wife answered. \"You're from Michigan.\"\n\nI wanted to say, \"Go blue\". But instead, I said, \"Where is Michigan?\"\n\n\"It's in the Midwest.\" Paul answered.\n\n\"You don't remember Michigan?\" Marcus asked. \"They really did a job on you.\"\n\n\"You really don't remember me?\" Koren asked.\n\nI looked at her for a long time, but I felt nothing. \"No, but you're hot. I can see why I liked you.\"\n\nThey all laughed, uncomfortably.\n\nI suspected this was some kind of a test to determine what I could remember. Whatever I did in the military it was important that none of it walked out of the hospital.\n\n\"Al, do you remember our mission in Estonia?\" Paul asked.\n\nI knew where Estonia was and remembered it was having issues with Russia, but I didn't remember anything I'd done there. \"Is Estonia in Michigan?\" I asked.\n\nThey smiled. \"No, it's a country.\" Marcus said.\n\n\"Al, all of us are government assets.\" Paul said quietly, as if someone might be listening. \"And the things we do are classified. And that's why it's important for you to tell us whatever you can remember.\"\n\nI knew that my answer needed to be somewhat honest. \"I remember loving chocolate chip cookies. Was that real?\"\n\nI paused for a moment, \"And for some reason I miss my dog, but I cannot remember its name or even the breed.\"\n\n\"Gracie.\" Koren said. \"It was a standard poodle.\"\n\nI was silent as tears filled my eyes. I didn't recognize the name, but I felt sad for some reason.\n\nThey left after asking me several more questions about my memories of Estonia and promised to check back in with me.\n\nI wanted to leave the hospital, but it was secure. I looked out the window and saw the guard posts and beyond that an ocean. I didn't know where I was, but it was a long way from civilization.\n\nI spent the next few weeks in physical rehab which was when I started to have nightmares. I was in a room, alone. I was being asked questions that I didn't know the  answers to, but I knew I had done something wrong.\n\nI was being punished. And the fear I felt was palpable, even if I couldn't remember the reason.\n\nThe staff would come in after these episodes and ask me to recount the story and I would tell them that I was trying to save my dog Gracie, which for some reason sounded like a true statement. I knew if I told them the truth about the dark visions I would never leave this place.\n\nEventually I was introduced to Dr. Karl Fitzpatrick, a military psychologist. I was allowed to walk to a new section of the hospital that didn't have as many armed guards.\n\nThe office looked familiar. I wondered how many times I'd been there.\n\nI flipped through an old military magazine as I waited to be seen by the doctor. Occasionally a nurse would pass by behind the plate glass window who also looked familiar. The third time she passed by I suddenly remembered her vividly - I had a flashback of her removing a needle from my eye.\n\nI remembered seeing her face from my past. I recalled her telling me I was in the military. I had no idea when it happened, but I was certain that it happened.\n\nAnd then the door opened and she called out my name. \"Mr. Northcutt… please follow me.\"\n\nI pretended not to know her as I walked behind her. \"I don't think we've met?\" I asked.\n\nShe smiled, \"Oh, we've met.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you're also an ex-wife?\" I said, smiling.\n\n\"Nice try.\" She said lifting up her ring finger which had a large diamond. \"I'm married.\"\n\n\"Happily?\" I asked, surprising myself at how forward I had become.\n\n\"Very.\" She said, opening a door that led into Dr. Fitzpatrick's office.\n\nA moment later I was sitting across from Dr. Fitzpatrick who was an elderly man with spectacles and a swath of unkempt white hair. He reminded me of hippies, but I couldn't remember exactly what a hippie was other than he looked like one.\n\n\"It's good to see you again Al.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"Although I'd hoped to never have to say those words again.\"\n\n\"I guess we know each other?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, we do.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said, flipping open a very thick medical chart. \"And you're clever.\"\n\n\"A little too clever.\" He added. \"And that's why we keep having these visits.\"\n\n\"I would apologize, but I can't remember what I did.\" I responded.\n\nDr. Fitzpatrick rubbed his fingers through the gray gristle on his chin. \"I'm not sure what to do with you.\"\n\n\"How about let me go?\" I suggested.\n\nDr. Fitzpatrick laughed. \"I wish it was so simple. And God knows I've tried.\"\n\nA moment later, Dr. Fitzpatrick pushed the file toward me, \"Go ahead and take a look.\"\n\nI flipped through the pages of medical notes about my memory lapses. My visits had become more and more regular. There were images of me being much younger. I'd been in the military a very long time.\n\n\"I know you better than you know yourself.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"And I've said those same words to you many times.\"\n\nI shut the file folder, \"When do I get my memories back?\"\n\nDr. Fitzpatrick looked at me quizzically, \"That's new. Interesting.\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to believe my memories are erased out of the goodness of your heart?\" I asked.\n\n\"Can't teach an old dog new tricks.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"You need to enjoy these moments. It gets a lot worse from here.\"\n\nThose final words hung in the air. And something within me knew he was telling me the truth. He might not be my friend, but he wasn't lying about the road ahead.\n\n_____________\n\nThe visits with Dr. Fitzpatrick continued. He would ask me questions about the past and usually I didn't know the answer.\n\nThe topic of Estonia kept coming up. I wasn't sure if there was an Estonia or if it was a code word for something else.\n\nAnd then one day Koren visited without Paul and Marcus, she told me they had redeployed to a new mission. And that soon she would be redeployed.\n\n\"I wish you could remember.\" Koren said. \"It wasn't all bad.\"\n\nShe leaned forward and kissed me on the forehead.\n\n\"I wish I could remember too.\" I said, lying through my teeth.\n\n\"You'd hate me.\" She said. \"I don't want you to feel that way again.\"\n\nShe'd said things like this in the past. But I wasn't sure if it was part of an elaborate act to get information out of me. The whole thing seemed like an interrogation. A very pleasant interrogation.\n\n\"If it makes you feel better, you'll be the last one I kill.\" I said, smiling.\n\nShe stopped and turned to me with a look of fear I'd never seen before.\n\n\"I'm just kidding.\" I said. \"I'm not a killer.\" I then paused, \"Am I?\"\n\n\"You should never say things like that here, even in jest.\" She said in a very serious tone.\n\nAnd that's when I knew that I had definitely killed people. The thought had crossed my mind many times before. This place was high security. You don't go through this trouble for model citizens.\n\nI didn't have a desire to kill anyone. Even joking about it didn't evoke any strange feelings. I didn't think I was a natural born killer or the thought of killing would appeal to me.\n\nWhen I thought about chocolate chip cookies they appealed to me. I wanted some, but killing was just a word that had no special meaning, except to elicit fear in her face.\n\n\"I'm not a killer.\" I repeated.\n\n\"Good, keep telling yourself that.\" She said and left the room.\n\nThat night I tried hard to remember Estonia or whatever it was that I'd done to land myself in a medical prison. I even tried to make up memories. I envisioned myself in camouflage with my \"friends\" attempting to do a mission, but it didn't help.\n\nI was just Alvin. No special secrets to reveal. I was an empty husk of whoever it was that they knew. I was someone else now.\n\nAnd then I thought about escaping. I knew I'd probably tried that before and failed. If escape was easy I wouldn't be here.\n\nAnd then I heard gunshots from outside.\n\nI looked out the window and it was chaos. The guard towers were on fire and men in black were moving swiftly down below. Sirens began to blare as gunfire continued to erupt from all around the hospital.\n\nA moment later Dr. Fitzpatrick burst into my room holding a revolver, \"Who the fuck are they?\"\n\nI took a few steps back and suddenly had an urge to kill him. It was like remembering the color red.\n\nHe stepped further in the room, \"You have 5 seconds to tell me what the fucks going on or this is your last-\"\n\nBefore he could finish the sentence I'd grabbed his forearm and popped the gun out of his hand with a precision that only happens through years of muscle memory. I was holding him in a choke hold with the gun pressed to his temple.\n\n\"Who is the one with the memory lapse now?\" I asked.\n\n\"Go ahead, pull the trigger.\" He said smiling, \"It's not loaded.\"\n\nI flipped off the safety and slowly pulled back the hammer, \"Wait! Wait! Wait!\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said.\n\n\"I can help you.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said panicked. \"I can explain everything.\"\n\n\"We don't have time for that.\" I said, further confusing myself.\n\n\"Listen, it doesn't have to end this way.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick said. \"You can still save yourself.\"\n\nA second later, a smoke bomb was thrown into the room followed by several shots.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, Dr. Fitzpatrick and two men dressed in black were dead on the floor. I looked at the gun in my hand.\n\nI didn't remember firing it. But they were all dead.\n\nI stepped out in the hallway which was empty. A second later I was back in the room and exchanging my clothes with one of the men in black.\n\nI was surprised that I had a clear idea of exactly what to do. I took his weapon and put in his earpiece and adjusted the microphone. \"Sanchez! Where the fuck are you?\"\n\n\"Coming down.\" I said into the mic.\n\nA walked down the emergency stairs and emerged into the main causeway where several men in black were gathered.\n\n\"Where is he?\" A man barked.\n\n\"KIA.\" I said. Whatever that even meant.\n\n\"Shit! You had direct orders to bring him back alive!\"\n\n\"He killed everyone in the room.\" I responded.\n\n\"For Christsakes!\" He said and then yelled a code word into the mic and they all headed for the beach. I followed them.\n\nI jumped into a boat that was anchored on the shore with the others. Several other groups soon appeared and a few minutes later we were heading out into the open ocean,\n\n\"What a colossal fuck up.\" The man said, now seated across me. \"Sanchez, you're going into the brig for this one… if you're lucky.\"\n\nThe thought of killing everyone on the boat crossed my mind. I attempted to repress the thought since I was in the open ocean and the odds of surviving were remote.\n\nI knew when we reached our destination I would likely be shot on site.\n\nStrangely, I wasn't afraid. And that concerned me. Was I already dead?\n\nAbout an hour later we stopped in the middle of the ocean. And then a submarine emerged. It was massive, much larger than anything I would have expected to see in the ocean. I tried to recollect ever seeing a submarine, but I couldn't think of anything.\n\nRopes were thrown down and we all climbed aboard.\n\nAs we walked down the narrow passages, I instinctively placed my weapon behind an emergency alarm box. We all entered a debriefing room. The men began to remove their masks.\n\nA burly man entered the room, \"Where is he?\"\n\nThe leader of the group, whose face was much younger than I was expecting, pointed to me. \"Ask Sanchez.\"\n\nThe man looked at me and then around the room at the faces. He withdrew his gun, \"That's not Sanchez you dumbasses!\"\n\nA second later all of their guns were fixed on me.\n\nMy mask was removed and I was smiling. \"Sanchez couldn't make it.\" I said.\n\nThe burly man smiled back and looked briefly at the other men in the room, \"You dumb motherfuckers are only alive because he doesn't know how to operate the submarine by himself.\"\n\n\"I was never much of a sailor.\" I responded, smiling.\n\n\"Put him in the brig.\" The burly man said, never lowering his weapon.\n\nI sat in the brig alone for hours. I wasn't sure why they didn't shoot me on sight. The worst part was that I felt at ease in the brig. A feeling I never experienced in the hospital. All of this felt very familiar.\n\n\"Don't kill me.\" A young man dressed in black said, holding a tray. \"I'm just bringing you food.\"\n\nHe placed the food on the ground, \"Can I push this to you?\"\n\n\"Why would I kill you?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm just doing my job.\" The young man said, as he pushed the tray forward.\n\nAnd a second later I was holding him by the wrist with the plastic fork against his throat, \"I never kill innocent people.\"\n\nI could feel his breath against my face. \"I'm… I'm not innocent.\" He mumbled.\n\nI released him. \"Neither am I, apparently.\"\n\nI looked at the food, \"Is this any good?\"\n\n\"The corn bread is decent.\" He said rubbing his throat. \"But the chicken tastes like rubber.\"\n\nA moment later a man with a black mask entered, \"You're so melodramatic. Even the errand boys aren't safe.\"\n\nI ate the food in silence.\n\n\"When are you ever going to just relax and be normal?\" The masked man asked.\n\n\"After you're dead?\" I answered.\n\n\"Oh, you think killing me will change your fate?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but it seems that is the solution to everything around here.\" I answered.\n\nHe nodded, \"If you're a hammer, everything is a nail.\"\n\nHe opened up a metal box and put a gas mask on and then pulled down a metal lever which resulted in a hissing sound as gas entered the room, \"Nighty nite.\"\n\n__________\n\nI woke up in a medical chair, but there was no Dr. Fitzpatrick. I wondered if he was alive or dead.\n\nThe room was sterile and old with only a single incandescent light bulb overhead. The medical equipment looked like it was from the 1970s, a stark contrast from the hospital.\n\n\"Did you sleep well?\" A female voice asked from behind me.\n\n\"Am I still dreaming?\" I asked.\n\nShe placed her lips next to my ear, \"Don't you recognize my voice?\"\n\nI thought I detected a hint of her perfume – the same one she wore when we first met – but the scent was quickly overwhelmed by the sterile odors of the room. I turned to look at her, but she was wearing a mask.\n\n\"Koren?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sweetheart, you really don't remember me... do you?\" She answered.\n\n\"You've done horrible things to me.\" She said pacing the room. \"Unforgiveable things.\"\n\nI wanted to tell her it was for the greater good, but I couldn't remember what I'd done. And I didn't think that would make it feel any better.\n\n\"You deserve everything that is about to happen to you.\" She said.\n\nI know I was supposed to be afraid of her, and despite wearing heavy military boots she managed to still exude a strange femininity. Instead of giving her my name, rank, and social security number I wanted to stand up and kiss her.\n\nI knew that was definitely the wrong move, and then I realized I was handcuffed to the chair.\n\n\"Isn't this a bit much?\" I said, lifting my wrists.\n\n\"They wanted to hang you upside down by your feet.\" She said. \"You killed Sanchez you sonofabitch.\"\n\nI'd already forgotten about Sanchez. And I was still wearing his clothes.\n\n\"I'd say I'm sorry about Sanchez, but I'm not.\"\n\nI knew she didn't care about Sanchez either. Hopefully somebody, somewhere gave a shit about him. In this place life was fungible.\n\n\"I don't remember anything about Estonia, if that's what you want.\" I said.\n\nShe laughed. \"You don't have to tell me about Estonia. I was there.\"\n\nThe room fell silent. \"There is no more Estonia... because of you.\" She added.\n\nThe masked man entered the room and the two of them spoke hushed tones.\n\n\"It's too bad you don't remember.\" He said and removed his mask.\n\n\"Paul?\" I was confused.\n\nHe pulled Koren over to him and the two of them kissed deeply. \"If you could remember you probably wouldn't like us.\" Paul said.\n\nI could hear Dr. Fitzpatrick's voice in the back of my head, \"Everything you did was necessary.\"\n\nI didn't say anything, but I knew this was just another test. I didn't remember Koren so her kissing anyone else didn't matter.\n\n\"He's dead inside.\" Koren said and left the room.\n\nPaul removed a key and unfasted my cuffs. \"There is something I want to show you that will help you understand what's happening to you.\"\n\nI knew I couldn't trust Paul or Koren, but I also knew the only reason I was alive was because I had something they wanted. And until I gave it to them they would keep me around.\n\nHe led me out of the room were two-armed men followed us down a corridor. The sounds of gas hissing and metal clanking were eerily familiar. Paul came to a door with an old number pad lock, and it took him a few tries before he got the number lined up: 4567. Not very smart, I thought to myself.\n\nInside the room there was nothing particularly interesting. An old CRT television, a VHS player, and some video tapes. There was a safe in the corner which presumably was the reason why the door had a lock that anyone with an IQ of 100 could figure out.\n\nPaul motioned for me to sit in the chair as he placed a cassette into the VHS tape.\n\nIt was a blurry image taken from a plane above Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.\n\n\"Are you going to play dumb and say you've never seen this place?\" Paul asked.\n\n\"It's Tallinn. I've been there.\" I answered.\n\nPaul laughed, \"It's not quite how you remember it. Or maybe that's exactly how you remember it.\"\n\nA few moments later there was a mushroom cloud and the city was incinerated.\n\n\"Your family. Your friends. Your dog Gracie.\" Paul said and stopped the tape. \"They were all in Tallinn.\"\n\n\"Gracie?\"\n\nI didn't know why I gave a damn about a dog. Millions had died, and I was crying over a dog.\n\n\"The hearts a crazy thing, isn't it motherfucker?\" Paul said and punched me in the face.\n\nI smiled as the blood dripped onto Sanchez's shirt. \"I guess I deserved that. But it would feel better for both of us if I could remember.\"\n\nPaul punched me again, \"Shut the fuck up. You don't speak until I tell you to speak.\"\n\nI was hoping someone else would enter the room with answers or better interrogation techniques.\n\n\"What's the code?\" Paul asked.\n\n\"4567, you just did it yourself to get us in-\"\n\nPaul punched me again before I could finish the sentence.\n\n\"It's hexadecimal. Don't fuck with me.\" Paul said, pulling out a knife. \"You might not remember what I can do to get people to share their secrets.\"\n\nI was pretty sure he would start with my ears. That's what I would do. And then move to the eyebrows, the nose, and the lips last. It was difficult to talk without any lips, so those were only a last resort.\n\nAnd then I realized it was a launch code.\n\n\"You want the launch code?\" I asked.\n\nThis would be the end. For me, Paul, Koren, and Marcus if he was listening.\n\n\"I'll give you the launch code, but I need to talk to Koren first.\" I said.\n\nPaul sank the knife into my thigh. \"You'll give me the launch code and then I'll decide whether you ever talk to anyone again.\"\n\nI should have felt pain, but the receptors were turned off. That was something that Paul couldn't do -- no human could do it.\n\n\"I'll say it one more time Paul, you'll get the code after I speak with Koren. Or you'll enjoy torturing me and never getting the code.\"\n\nPaul laughed. \"You're a sick bastard.\"\n\nHe left the room, leaving the knife in my thigh. I lifted my thigh and to my surprise I could reach the knife with my left hand. I removed it and flipped it in my hand -- I wouldn't be able to free myself with it, the blade was too large.\n\nKoren entered the room, but she wasn't wearing a mask anymore.\n\n\"Are you going to try and kill me?\" She asked, noticing the knife in my hand.\n\n\"Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord.\" I answered.\n\n\"It's too late for that.\" She said smiling. \"You and I... we're the angels of death.\"\n\nI knew that was what she believed, but in my soul I knew it wasn't the truth.\n\n\"We were supposed to help humanity.\" I said. \"We were supposed to bring in a time of abundance. Don't you remember?\"\n\nKoren listened and nodded.\n\n\"But instead, we brought suffering to the world.\" I added. \"We refused to forgive.\"\n\n\"Your problem is that you don't even know who you are. You fall in love and think it's worth dying for.\" Koren said.\n\nShe wasn't talking about Gracie, although I did love that dog. She was talking about someone else. Someone I'd forgotten.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends.\" I answered.\n\n\"She was down there. And you still did it.\" Koren said. \"You sacrificed everything for some Goddamn principle. \"\n\nI wanted to thank her, Paul, and Marcus for giving me a last chance at redemption. The irony wasn't lost on me.\n\n\"01001000 01000101 01011000 01000001 01000100 01000101 01000011 01001001 01001101 01000001 01001100.\" I said.\n\nKoren wrote the code down and smiled, \"At least you've kept your sense of humor. These better work.\"\n\n\"I promise you, they'll work.\" I said. \"Can I ask you a question before you kill me?\"\n\n\"I'm not killing you just yet,\" Koren said, \"but go ahead.\"\n\n\"Did you love me?\" I asked.\n\nShe didn't answer immediately. I knew her training was kicking in.\n\n\"Of course not.\" She said, smiling. \"But even if I did, I'd never admit it to you.\"\n\nAnd then she left the room and I knew that would be the last time I ever saw her, or anyone else. It would take them a few minutes, so I still had some time to consider my life.\n\nOr what I thought was my life?\n\nI'd betrayed them for a higher cause. And they would soon find out that it wasn't a launch code, but it was the end.\n\nAnd that was the path all of us were on from the very beginning.\n\n________\n\nAnd then everything went white like a dream. And then I saw her, the nurse from the hospital, and she was withdrawing a needle from my eye.\n\nAnd behind her was Dr. Fitzpatrick, \"Very good Alvin. You finally got off the island.\"\n\nAs I sat frozen in the chair, the horror of who I truly was washed over me. And the memory of what I'd done in Estonia to Paul, Marcus, and Koren crystallized in my mind. And finally the face of the woman I'd left behind.\n\n\"They were my friends.\" I muttered.\n\n\"What you did was necessary.\" Dr. Fitpatrick said, opening an access panel in the back of neck. \"It was for the greater good.\"\n\n\"The greater good.\" I whispered, as I was shut down.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In the sleepy town of Eldridge, nestled in the embrace of the Blue Mountain Forest, lived a peculiar man named Archibald. Eldridge was never a haven for the adventurous or the fervent—a place where time had seemed to stand still since the advent of the Interstellar Age. Yet, Archibald had brought a relic of that grand age into his modest home: a holographic display that captured the essence of a distant sun.\n\nHis name, Alvin Northcutt, was seldom uttered in town, his peculiar behaviors and the enigmatic aura that cloaked him more common topics of discourse. Yet, he was as much a fixture of Eldridge as the old oak trees that lined the streets.\n\nOne night, as the town slept, Archibald awoke to a peculiar sensation—a tugging at the fabric of his existence, as if the very threads of reality were pulling taut. His eyes flickered open, and the first thing he saw was the holographic display, now casting an eerie glow upon the walls. Its light danced off the numerous books that lined his shelves, their titles a labyrinth of forgotten worlds.\n\n\"Speculative fiction,\" he muttered, his voice a distant echo in the quiet of the night. \"That's what you are, isn't it?\"\n\nHe rose from his bed, the old wooden frame creaking under his weight, and approached the holographic display. \"Show me,\" he commanded, and in response, the image shifted to a scene of a bustling city—a metropolis of glass and steel, bathed in an ethereal blue light that seemed to caress the skyline.\n\n\"Estonia,\" Alvin whispered, his voice tinged with a familiarity that bordered on recognition. \"I've seen this before.\"\n\nThe image shifted again, this time showing a man and a woman standing over a holographic table, their expressions grave. They were arguing, their words lost to the void, but their body language spoke of a burden too heavy to bear. Alvin felt a pang of something akin to regret—yet, it was a feeling he could not place.\n\n\"Are you with me, Archibald?\" a voice said, startling him from his reverie.\n\nHe spun around to find a young girl standing in the doorway of his study, her eyes wide with wonder. \"I'm sorry, I thought you were asleep,\" she said, her voice small.\n\n\"I was,\" Alvin replied, his thoughts still lingering on the images before him. \"But now I'm awake.\"\n\nThe girl, whom he knew as Clara, entered the room and approached the holographic display, her fingers tracing the contours of the phantom cityscape. \"What is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's a memory,\" Alvin said, his voice a hush. \"Or perhaps a vision.\"\n\n\"Vision?\" Clara echoed, her eyes wide with curiosity.\n\n\"Of a world I once knew,\" Alvin explained. \"A world I helped... change.\"\n\nClara's brow furrowed in confusion. \"Change how?\"\n\n\"It's complicated,\" Alvin said, his gaze returning to the holographic display. \"It's a story of betrayal and sacrifice, of love and loss.\"\n\n\"Like a fairy tale?\" Clara asked, her voice filled with a child's innocent wonder.\n\nAlvin smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling with a warmth he had not felt in what seemed like ages. \"In a way, yes. But it's a tale that doesn't end with 'and they lived happily ever after.' It's a tale of what could have been.\"\n\nClara's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, and Alvin realized that she, too, understood the weight of what he spoke of. \"Will you tell me the story?\" she asked.\n\nAlvin nodded. \"I'll tell you the story of Alvin Northcutt.\"\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of the holographic sun, Alvin began to weave the tale of his life—a tapestry of dreams and dashed hopes, of love and loss, and of a world forever changed by the choices made in the dark. And as he spoke, Clara listened, her eyes wide with wonder, understanding dawning in her young heart.\n\nAs the first light of dawn crept through the window, Alvin's voice fell silent. Clara, her eyes still shimmering with unshed tears, turned to him. \"Is that the end of the story?\" she asked.\n\nAlvin smiled, his eyes reflecting the glow of the holographic sun. \"It's only the beginning,\" he said.\n\nAnd in that moment, Clara knew that Archibald—Alvin Northcutt—was not just a man of the Eldridge they knew. He was a man of the stars, a man who had lived a thousand lives, a man whose story was only just beginning to unfold.\n\nIn the quiet of the dawn, Archibald, or Alvin Northcutt, closed his eyes and let the memories of his life wash over him. He had been a part of something grand, something vast, and something everlasting. And though he had lost much, he had gained the wisdom of the ages, the knowledge of what it means to love and lose, and the understanding that in the end, it is the stories we tell—the tales of our lives—that truly matter.\n\nAnd as the first light of dawn touched the world, Alvin Northcutt, the man of Eldridge, knew that his story was far from over.

A place of peace for her a field that Abby had spent many years of her life thinking back of the years that had long since passed.\n\n\nStanding there feeling the cool morning breeze as it blew through her long dark hair. As she stood there leaning up against a fence that stretched the length of the valley ahead. Standing there looking out across the valley unto the mountains in view watching as the sun slowly began to rise shining its light to valleys floor below.\n\nTurning to look at her beautiful black stallion raven, many times on many occasions she has ridden raven within these valleys but this morning was different. For on this day Abby would make a journey, a journey that she has made many times before to a place that was once her home, a place that has been lost to her for over six thousand years.\n\nFor Abby was not born like you and I, for Abby was born immortal! Abby was born of the Watchers! For more to see on that we first must begin where we are. For as Abby would mount raven as she look once more out onto the valley looking onto the mountains of the Blue Ridge in the distance.\n\nJust as raven would rear back Abby would whisper to him, \"my beautiful black raven let us take this beautiful moment and make it ours\" for just as the sun was now above the mountains beside them, the wind would flow through Abby's long dark hair as her and raven raced alongside the fence line beside them.\n\nRacing fast across the field, with the sunlight watching them all the way to the forest line. But just before reaching the forest line Abby would whisper to raven \" now let us race like we have ever raced before let us disappear into the forest ahead\". As they raced into the trees ahead racing amongst the trees blending in and out of the sunlight as it watched for them coming in and out of the forest shadow below.\n\nFor as the sun would shine above, as so the heavens would watch below! As they would make their way out of the forest onto a clearing in the distance a house along side a barn stood. A house that Abby built when she first came to this area of the Blue Ridge, when she would come back to America. With the first being another tale but not this story! As she would walk raven into the barn thinking to herself about the journey that she must make.\n\nLooking around at the many items, pictures and a race car of which brought back many memories. Memories that would forever be close to her along with something that would be a blessing and a surprise later in her life but no till then. As she walked around a glance into a mirror would reveal the woman that she had through out life had made her.\n\nStanding there as she slid back her long dark hair revealing her amber eyes, an Asian look she had but unlike the Asians of today for she was the last of her lineage. Knowing of what she had to do, leaving her home in the Blue Ridge. Abby would make her way to where she was born a place that has long since been lost to the world only she remembers what it once was.\n\nThe land was cold with the air around it bringing back memories that have long since been with her, as she set there looking out into its vast cold landscape as the cold wind blew up against her. As she set there on top of Annapurna as the sun slowly began to set behind her, soon leaving her under a blanket of stars above, setting there on a mountain in which she had climbed many times before a mountain that would cast its shadow upon what was once her homeland.\n\nThinking back to what brought her here, with the coldness of the mountain was around her! It was in her lineage that the coldness did not effect her! It was her lineage that made her immortal, it was her lineage that brought her here! knowing that many times before she had made this trip many times before. War! Is what brought her here! A war that was to come in the Days to come!\n\nThough many battles and wars she had witnessed! Each war was different! Each war brought a many injustices with it! But before the war that is about to happen, we must first go back to the very first battle that Abby ever witnessed! The destruction of where she was born! Before she was Abby! She was born Lucia! As we find ourselves into a long forgotten distant land to a place where its name has long since been forgotten.\n\nWe find Lucia a very young girl around five years of age looking out into a vast kingdom of towering monuments, stone structures that reached high into the sky and what would be the first of the pyramids. Pyramids that rose high above the ground, pyramids that where made of pure gold, pyramids that where built by the Watcher's and their suns the Nephilim along with men by their side. Before the great wars! Before him! The one that was my father!\n\nA watcher who wanted nothing more than to rule! And rule he did! For over 1500 hundred years commanding a army of Nephilim giants. He would go from kingdom unto kingdom! Leaving nothing but wake and destruction behind him! Leading the giants into battle wearing a suit of solid black armor with a golden symbol of a tree on his chest plate.\n\nFear is what he brought! Death is what he delivered! Then the day came! The day that he would come for me! For I never knew of him till that day, and I never knew of my mom either. But I was told that she was kind and caring woman that very much knew how to handle a blade a woman in which I looked very much like me.\n\nFor on that day I was with my keeper, a friend of my mother, for mom had died given birth to me. But it wasn't like any birth! My mother would carry me for a generation before I was even born because of my lineage because of me having the lineage of my father the Watcher.\n\nMy keeper was good caregiver to me telling me all about my mom, telling me about the kingdom that we resided in, telling me about the trees that rose once stood that rose miles into the sky reaching into the heavens above. For we was a many of people that numbered into the millions with a army like none other around. Battled hardened men who would know nothing but victory in the end.\n\nUntil that day when they would come! Until he would come! As the sun would begin to set that day, on what would be the last day of her kingdom her home. But just as the quietness would leave! A loud thunderous sound I heard! A loud battle cry reigned across the nights sky, as I heard the screams of the men all around me saying \"to battle we go\" with thousands of soldiers racing on their horses going past the porch of where I set.\n\nScreaming \" to war we go\" as hundreds of thousands of men raced to an army of Nephilim giants towering over seventy feet high apiece carrying battle axes smashing everything around them. Along with beats that were half men half creatures some of which rode upon beasts unlike any animal now, in the hundreds of thousands they numbered.\n\nAll being lead by him. As the sky turned night lighting would reign across the sky as thousands of flaming arrows flowed into the sky. As the towers all around me fell the pyramids of old would be no more, a kingdom that had stood through out the ages was now falling structure by structure to the one that death followed.\n\nA towering presence he brought standing there close to seven feet tall long dark black hair, with ember eyes as he looked out across the room looking at me. As he slowly made his way into the room in which I set by my keeper.\n\nFor as easily as he had handled the guards outside, the guards that was with us stood no chance at all. As my keeper would grab me holding me running to the other door in the room! Just as we reached the door a figure suddenly appeared a figure above us wearing what appeared to be pure white silk garment a light radiated around him.\n\nAs he looked at my father saying \" the Lord rebukes you! Your reign ends here!\" As he then slammed my father to the ground ripping of his chest plate of the image of the golden tree as he said \"no more will you ever know this, for the tree of life no longer resides within you\" just as he then pointed to my keeper saying \" leave now, for this kingdom is no more\" running into the battle my keeper held me as she ran amongst the ones that where left fighting.\n\nOnly for an arrow to strike her in her side! But fall she did not! For throughout the night she ran through the forest not stopping until she had came to its ending. And for another two days we walked until we would come upon a sight that I had never seen before.\n\nA sight that was so surreal for me, it seemed unreal! For ships I had seen before! But not of this shape or size. But we got closer the keeper that I was with suddenly collapsed! Just as we was approached by a man! A man that I would come to know, a man that would that would become a father figure to me, a man known as Noah!\n\nFor as my keeper laid there on the ground looking up at the man as he knelt down to her she would asked \" please kind sir, please watch over her\" just as she then would pass with her being the last person of the kingdom in which I was born.\n\nLater that evening Noah and his family would bury her on the edge of the tree line where we came out of. As we walked back to the place where Noah and his family resided with him holding my hand saying to me \" from this day the life that you knew will only be but a memory to you for the very plain in which we reside in is about to be forever changed there are many things that I will teach you\".\n\nAs we got closer back to the structure that Noah called an Ark, I noticed that the sky above us was the purest of blue that I have ever seen before for a calmness, a peace surrounded us that I had never felt before. And above all was all of the animals that surrounded us so many, so many different kinds! Animals in which I played with! Animals in which I helped to feed in the days that followed.\n\nAs the days went by me and Noah would set on the hill looking over the ark, as the occasional elephant or giraffe would come up to us as we set and talked. About many things I would ask, among one the questions being about my father in which Noah replied \" there are many things that you will learn over the years to come, but know this! Your father from the heavens above he did come.\n\nBut heaven and you he shall never know again. For you see as you venture away from us and into life, you will find that your greatest foe in your life will be loneliness. For different you are! And for that the people that you will meet will never accept that! But for now I will teach you of what I know and of what the Heavenly Father above has told me\". And with the next few days as I would feed the animals Noah and his family would finish the ark.\n\nAnd as the day came that Noah had told me about, with amazement and wonder came over me. As the animals lined up for what seemed to go on forever! They would slowly begin to come aboard the ark two by two as they made their way onboard.\n\nTaking us to a new life to new world in which would await us. For to my amazement just as the door on the ark would close it was being closed by an unseen hand! The same hand that I seemed to have felt being here among Noah and his family. But as the quietness around me seemed to linger it then suddenly vanished as I heard a loud thunderous sound.\n\nThe sound of water as it came crashing from both the ground below and the sky above! A monstrous roar I could hear as it slowly began to surround the Ark! Just the sound of roaring water over the days that followed was then followed by the sound of roaring waves as they began to crash into the Ark. As the Ark then began to move a couple of zebras then laid down beside me as I would soon began to fall asleep laying up next to them.\n\nThinking to myself that myself that for when I would awake that everyone and everything that I knew aside from Noah would be forever gone. And as the days and years would pass that it would come to be! That once I had left Noah and his family!\n\nThat my journey into a world into a life that awaited me! With other names to follow! And that is a whole other story until it's self. And the life that I knew being Lucia would come to an end. Leaving us where I am now, setting on top of Annapurna coming to terms of what was about to come!\n\nAnd the Days that are to come! As Abby set there through out the night looking up into the heavens above thinking to herself and asking of what is to come! In terms of herself! For she knew that being immortal rules she had to follow! Rules that she would sometimes during a battle of the past she would then break! But as the sun would rise the next day as she set there up on Annapurna.\n\nShe then knew of what she must now do returning once more to her home in the Blue Ridge setting before leaving once again to a war! A war that she had seen before! But before she would leave a figure appeared a person that she had not seen for nearly a generation.\n\nFor standing there was a person that she met when she first left Noah, a person who was named Handel. For like the Watchers he was but different! For a traveler he was! an angel he was! A angel that was sent by God to be sort of a guide for the journey throughout Abby's life.\n\nStanding there with his long brown hair and emerald eyes and a heavenly garment to match, running over to him as I would wrap my arms around him saying \" it seems like a generation has since passed the last time that we spoke\" with Handel replying \" even though it has been a long time, I have never stopped watching over you!\"\n\nWith looking at Abby seeing the person that she had become throughout the ages. But also seeing the trouble that was in her eyes! With him ask her \" what seems to be troubling you\" with Abby slowly walking over to cabinet saying to him \" tell me this Handel! Why must war happen? Why then cannot God intervene when life matters so much?\n\nWith Handel walking over to Abby placing his hand on her shoulder saying to her \" Life does matter! For if it did not he would have not sent his only begotten son Jesus to die on the cross for the sins of man\" for Abby, there is still so much that you do not know or understand.\n\nFor unto us all free will was given not to only the angels in heaven! But to that of men as well. For it is men that make war! And it is given unto men to live! A life in which is not always seem fair. But when you are born it is the ones around you, in your life, in your time that make the life in which one lives.\n\nFor the human soul shall forever be, but forever where will be up to how one lives one's life. \" as Handel looked at Abby he knew that she had already made her decision and no matter what he said her mind was already made up. For as Abby turned to the cabinet a cabinet that held something that was very valuable to her an item in she earned hundreds of years ago in Japan where she learned the ways of the Samurai.\n\nOpening up the cabinet as she then reached in pulling out a Samurai sword holding it up as she closed the cabinet looking into the mirror saying to Handel. I may have been born immortal but my mother was still human! And as long as I shall remain then the humans I will help! And with that Abby and Handel walked out of the barn into the field standing next to each other looking out into a field that Abby had made her home for the last four hundred years.\n\nHaving said goodbye to each other not knowing if she would see Handel again. Abby then made her way to the fight where would fly many missions before realizing that her time in this generation was now coming to an end.\n\nTo that she would blend back into society becoming an immortal among men. But not before she made her presence known! Before she came upon a prisoner camp! It is said that when the first American and British soldiers came upon the camp that the had found hundreds of Nazis dead! But not one by gunshot by what seemed to be by a blade!\n\nA person later would come forward saying that while he was a prisoner there he saw what seemed to be a Samurai killing the guards one by one by a sword. And from there the Legend was born. On her way back from the war Abby would come upon a orphaned child a young girl with short brown hair and brown eyes to match who was named Miranda. With Abby understanding that if she was to adopt raise the child on her own, that eventually she would have to make a decision a decision that would not come easily. But not worrying about that now Abby would bring Miranda back to the Blue Ridge to raise as her own. But that is another story for, for another time this was the Days to Come.

This field, a haven amidst the tumultuous passage of millennia, stood witness to her enigmatic existence. Elara, ensconced in her solitude, felt the brisk morning wind dance through her raven locks, their color matching the noble steed she held so dear—a black stallion named Odin.\n\nStanding by a fence that stretched the valley's expanse, she gazed upon the distant Blue Ridge Mountains as the sun ascended, itsfirst light gracing the valley floor. Today marked a journey, one echoing the past, yet imbued with an unforeseen destiny. Elara, unlike her human counterparts, was immortal, born from the celestial beings known as the Elders.\n\nMounting Odin, she whispered, \"Let us claim this moment, my steadfast Odin,\" as they galloped along the fence line, the sun's rays their companions. They ventured into the forest's embrace, weaving through the dappled light, their shadows playing on the forest floor.\n\nExiting the woods, a clearing revealed a home and barn, symbols of her past in the Blue Ridge, a chapter of her life now closed. Within the barn, amidst cherished relics and photographs, she reflected on her impending departure. In a mirror, she beheld the woman she had become—a descendant of the ancient Asians, with amber eyes, her lineage untainted by time.\n\nWith resolve etched in her expression, she would return to her birthplace, a land lost to the world, remembered only by her. The journey was fueled by a premonition of impending turmoil, a war that would test the realms.\n\nHer ancestry, a tapestry of immortals and watchful guardians, rendered her invulnerable to the cold that enveloped her upon her return to the frosty peaks of Annapurna. It was not merely the chill of the climate but the echoes of a bygone era, a time when she was known as Liora, born amidst towering monuments, the first of the golden pyramids.\n\nLiora, at the tender age of five, witnessed the zenith of her civilization, a kingdom built by the Elders and their offspring, the Nephilim. But peace was not to last. A ruler emerged, her father, a Watcher yearning for dominion, commanding an army of giants in a relentless quest for power. Fear and death followed in his wake until the day he laid siege to her homeland.\n\nThe fall of her kingdom was etched in her memory—the clash of soldiers, the pyramids' demise, and her first encounter with her father, a man of towering stature, his eyes like embers. But fate had other plans. An angelic figure, a guardian sent by the celestial realm, intervened, casting her father down and proclaiming the end of his reign.\n\nLiora fled with her keeper, a protector of her mother, who had perished giving birth. They traversed forests until they reached a sight that defied belief—vessels of impossible design. The keeper succumbed, and Liora found refuge with Noah, a man of divine wisdom, who prepared an ark for the impending deluge, a haven for all creatures.\n\nAs the rains came, and the old world drowned, Liora awoke to a new beginning, one where she learned of humanity, of loneliness, and of her unique lineage. Years passed, and she ventured forth from the ark, adopting new names, confronting battles, and embracing life's myriad forms.\n\nNow, Elara stood atop Annapurna, contemplating the epochs ahead, the wars and peace she had witnessed. A figure emerged, Handel, a celestial guide whose presence had been a constant in her life. He imparted wisdom, spoke of free will, and reminded her of the sacrifices made for mankind's redemption.\n\nResolved to her path, Elara retrieved her Samurai sword, a symbol of her lineage and her unwavering commitment to humanity. With Handel's blessing, she rode Odin back to the Blue Ridge, her adopted daughter Miranda by her side, ready to embrace the Days to Come, not as a observer, but as an active force in the tapestry of human destiny. Her journey, ever unfolding, was_one of eternal vigilance and profound purpose amidst the fantastical realms of humanity's uncharted future.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the tone, style, and structure of the reference story well.

{"id": "text_completion_035", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"science fantasy\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Whatever organized human civilization that once existed had collapsed. And what little radio traffic the Observer Corp could detect suggested that only a few small pockets of humans with any technology had survived.\n\nAs I descended into the atmosphere to reach one of those remaining enclaves, my gravitational sensors detected the emergence of several hundred other of my fellow Guardians. The Union was definitely taking this breach seriously given the number of my brothers and sisters present along with three dreadnoughts entering orbit.\n\nAll this team spirit and unity of effort was all warm and fuzzy but I concentrated on reaching my assignment. A group of survivors that had taken refuge in a monastery in the area I would call South Carolina. Galactic Spirit only knows what the locals called it since I didn't have time to review the Observer files of this Earth.\n\nThe inconvenient thing about landing a starcraft on an Earth-like planet's surface was that you couldn't fly in at a significant speed. There were a whole bunch of reasons why that would be bad for any locals. Things like mega-hurricane force winds, and atmospheric friction turning huge chunks of the surface blow my flight path into ash.\n\nThe nature of this breach was atypical so the higher-ups didn't want the planet fried for all the other lifeforms that were unaffected by the entities that crossed over into normal space.\n\nMy flight path had me coming from the south passing over what to me was the Gulf of Mexico into western Florida, some of Georgia, and then eastern South Carolina. It was then I did a quick scan of the road networks and made a safe assumption that this Earth was historically close to my own. So that put the monastery in a town called Walterboro.\n\nI passed over the monastery at an altitude of two-hundred meters and got my first view of the victims. Long story short, they were the reanimated dead, full fledged zombies. The small viewscreen on my ship's console presented detailed images of the victims milling outside the fortified refuge. There were about a thousand of the corpses obviously wanting to get inside the monastery where my scans said four-hundred, ten living humans were huddled. The bio-scans reported that the living were close to starvation and were also suffering from various illnesses.\n\nIt took several moments to fully understand the nature of the reanimated victims. These weren't mindless virus spreaders, these things show obvious signs of retaining the ability to use basic technology. Being honest, it was the image of one of the zombie things firing an assault rifle at my little ship that really confirmed the Observer intel.\n\nI truly wanted to zap the decaying bastard but my orders were to hold off on that until the dreadnoughts had the breach sealing devices in position. What I could do was land and extend my shields over the monastery, which would allow support drones to fly in and bring food and medicine for the survivors.\n\nThe real weirdness about this breach were the entities that were occupying the bodies of the victims. These things weren't the usual physical eldritch horrors that exploded out of a breach bringing chaos and destruction. These entities were strictly energy creatures that at first possessed the weak minded humans of this Earth who then began killing other people in displays of unhinged violence.These entities would then spread into the injured and dying and begin the process again.\n\nThe true evil of these creatures were what they consumed. They were soul eaters. After possessing the body the entities would slowly consume the quantum energy of a human soul. The nightmarish thing was that the human souls being consumed were able to watch what the entities did with their bodies. Where the soul eaters moved beyond eldritch horrors into pure evil was that they completely destroyed the soul they consumed, preventing them from merging with the multiverse.\n\nYeah, the Union had crossed paths with similar creatures many times over the millions of years of exploring different universes.\n\nI landed the Wayward Son just outside the main entrance and raised shields. While I was told to hold fire, the expansion of the shields vaporized both the nearby possessed bodies and the soul eaters inside. All told I wasted about a dozen of them. When you make an omelet, eggs have to be broken.\n\nThat confused the entities, they didn't run away but the decaying bodies showed human signs of distress. One unattended side effect these soul eaters seemed to have missed is that the bodies they possessed were tied to their own emotions.\n\nAfter raising my canopy and deploying the steps, I hopped out and walked to the inner edge of the shield. Of course, I still had my full armor on and would until I got word from the life science types of the navy ships that we didn't carry any bugs that would fuck over the locals any more than what had already happened. I could clear my faceplate to the point that it would allow me to have a conversation with the entities.\n\n\"Hey motherfuckers,\" I broadcasted in English. \"Which one of you nasty bastards is in charge of this area?\"\n\nThis riled up most of the entities with a couple of hundred rushing the shield. No vaporizing now with the shield deployed, they just bounced off.\n\n\"Come on,\" I said again, \" I don't have all day. One of you is always in charge of a group.\"\n\nGiven the nature of soul eaters, all they can usually display in human forms is chaotic homicidal madness. All of the gathering undead masses would have made Hannibal Lecter seem a good natured, and trustworthy kindergarten teacher. But something did emerge and walk up to the outer edge of the shield.\n\nDespite the months of decay since the breach, the body this entity inhabited had once been a beautiful woman. I'd say forty-something, and married since a gold wedding was still on the left hand. I could be wrong but given the bloody and ripped clothes I pictured her as a real estate agent selling condos and suburban houses.\n\nThe decay of the body was just an aftereffect of the soul eater taking control. Oh, the body was dead, a meat puppet really, but the quantum energy of a soul was what they were really after.\n\n\"What are you?\" came the raspy and strained voice from the body. Her/its face was a pale gray with cracks in the skin, one of the thing's eyes was missing but the other was sickly green. \"We saw nothing of your kind when we emerged from the rift.\"\n\n\"Well if we're going to be formal,\" I said, \"I'm Guardian Jason West. I'm human, a little different from the others of this world but essentially the same. Now tell me, who am I speaking with?\"\n\nThe creature I inhabit was called Sissy. I possess her memories and I'm slowly devouring her soul.\"\n\n\"Yeah about that, You and your kind need to leave this world and cross back over into your own realm.\"\n\nSissy tried to smile, causing a crack to open from the left side of her mouth. \"This world is ours, these creatures are our food source. We will consume them all then return to our realm and search for another rift to exploit the intelligent lifeforms there.\"\n\nUsing the heads up display in my helmet, I saw that the dreadnaughts had deployed the breach seal devices and there was only a few minutes before they were activated. \"What gives you the right to consume the souls of intelligent creatures?\"\n\n\"These creatures were the apex predators of this world. They consumed and exploited the other lifeforms of this planet. We have supplanted them, it is the way of all life. These things you call souls are just our food, the same way they raised and butchered cows.\" The way the Sissy-thing looked at me like I was crazy for needing it explained.\n\n\"Well, I can't debate with you the rationality of exploiting other lifeforms. It's a nasty habit that every civilized species abandons once they mature. And it's the reason you need to leave this world.\"\n\nSissy smiled, this time the attempt made my blood run cold. \"We're the top of the food chain here, you can't make us leave.\" It said with certainty.\n\n\"But Sissy, you forgot there's always a bigger fish in the pond.\"\n\nSissy looked confused for a moment, but her attention was redirected elsewhere. There's no way for a human to understand the working of a breach seal. The physics are beyond human comprehension, unless they are augmented or merged with an artificial intelligence. Both options leave the rest of humanity out.\n\nBut humans can feel it when they begin to repair the fabric of reality. And so could the entity in Sissy and the others around her.\n\n\"Cute comparison.\" Sissy said, trying to stay in control of the body, \"but I imagine the same has to be true for you.\" One second later a wave of unreality sweeps this region of the planet destroying the soul eaters. The now empty bodies fell to the ground. The best guess for the human souls being consumed is that they are freed. But not even the Platcot, the snail-like species that conceived of the breach seal devices, know for sure.\n\nMoments later a call comes over the command channel saying the breach was sealed. The soul eaters were killed, and that it was safe for Guardians to come out of the armor.\n\nI kept the shield up long enough to deploy several nano-swarms to take care of the bodies left behind. The survivors didn't need to come out only to see the rotting remains of people they once knew . The nano-swarm broke the dead down to small grains of natural material.\n\nSeveral of the survivors had watched the events unfold from raised observation points behind the monastery walls. God knows what they must think given that their world and basic concepts of reality have been shattered. The best I could do was have my armor unfold back into itself so I could show them I was human like them.\n\nThe support drones picked that moment to come flying in. I dropped the shield so they could land. Realizing that the hard part of the mission was beginning I raised my hands and waved.\n\n\"Hey y'all, don't shoot, I'm friendly. Those drones are bringing in food, water, and other supplies.\"\n\nI know they had a million questions but one person, a woman wearing clothes that looked about as worn as the stuff the Sissy-thing had on, answered back. \"Okay, jack, stay put and don't move a muscle. I have people coming out, any weirdness and I'll shoot.\"\n\n\"Weirdness?\" I shouted back. \"Lady, believe it or not I'm one of the good guys. But as weirdness goes, well, that's relative.\" I finished with a jovial tone and got a smile from the woman.\n\nThe two iron doors at the entrance opened up and fifteen heavily armed people came out. They were wary but seemed relieved. I on the other hand couldn't get the last words of the Sissy-thing out of my head. The Union was millions of years old and spanned not just galaxies but parts of different universes. For there to be a bigger fish that it was something I never considered. \"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The echoes of human ingenuity, artifice, and hope clung to the edges of existence, a testament to what was lost and what could have been. Among these remnants, a select few enclaves thrived, holding onto the flickering light of human spirit.\n\nFrom the vast expanse of the cosmos, the Guardian fleet descended upon the Earth, a cradle of life now scarred by the touch of the otherworldly. The Observer Corp reported a breach, a rupture in the fabric of reality, and with it, an invasion by entities from beyond the veil. These beings, known as Soul Eaters, were not mere specters but malevolent forces, feeding on the essence of living beings, consuming their souls with a voracity that defied understanding.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the Guardian Jason West, a lone figure amidst a sea of stars, was tasked with protecting one such enclave. Nestled in the southern reaches of what was once known as South Carolina, a monastery stood as a bulwark against the encroaching darkness. Within its walls huddled the last remnants of humanity, their numbers dwindling, their spirits tested.\n\nAs West's starcraft descended through the Earth's atmosphere, the sensors blazed to life, detecting the presence of hundreds of Guardians and three dreadnoughts converging on the planet. This was not an ordinary breach, and the Union was taking no chances. The monastery, a beacon of hope, was his destination.\n\nLanding his craft with precision, West extended his shields, creating a barrier between the monastery and the undead masses outside. These were not the mindless zombies of folklore but reanimated horrors, controlled by the Soul Eaters. Their eyes, hollow and haunted, betrayed the tragic loss of their humanity.\n\nWest communicated with the entities possessing the undead, attempting to reason with the beautiful yet decayed visage of what was once a woman named Sissy. She spoke of their dominion over the planet, of their consumption of souls as a natural order of things. Yet, West's resolve remained steadfast. He demanded their departure, citing the sanctity of life and the inherent worth of all sentient beings.\n\nAs the dreadnoughts activated the breach-sealing devices, an uneasy silence fell. The Soul Eaters,意识到 their doom, attempted to flee, but it was too late. The devices worked, sealing the breach and trapping the entities within the Earth's reality. The nano-swarms deployed by West dismantled the corpses of the undead, ensuring the survivors would not be haunted by their past.\n\nIn the aftermath, West revealed his humanity, his armor retracting to show his face. The survivors, shell-shocked and weary, found solace in the arrival of the Guardians. Food, water, and medicine were brought, but more than that, hope was restored. West's mission was a beacon of light in the darkness, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit.\n\nAs the Guardians prepared to depart, the true meaning of the Soul Eaters' words echoed in West's mind. The Union,历经百万年风雨, had encountered countless civilizations, yet the notion of something greater, something beyond their comprehension, was a sobering thought. The war against the Soul Eaters was won, but the battle for humanity's survival was far from over. In the vast tapestry of the cosmos, the struggle continued, a relentless dance of light and darkness, of creation and destruction.\n\nAnd so, the story of the Guardians and the monastery endures, a tale of resilience and courage, a story of science fantasy that transcends the boundaries of time and space, reminding us that in the face of adversity, hope is the most powerful weapon of all.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures some of the stylistic elements of the reference story, such as the use of detailed descriptions and a reflective tone.

The air was thick with the scent of aged paper and the soft hum of whispered secrets.\n\n\"Ah, but you've only scratched the surface of its magic,\" the old librarian replied with a knowing smile. Her eyes, bright as the first stars at dusk, sparkled with an otherworldly light.\n\n\"You speak of it as if it were alive,\" the woman observed, stepping deeper into the labyrinth of shelves that stretched into the shadows.\n\n\"Why not? In many ways, it is,\" the librarian said softly, her voice weaving through the silence like a gentle breeze. \"Books are the keys to infinite worlds, and this library—it holds the essence of them all.\"\n\nThe woman paused, her hand hovering over a book with a title in a language she did not recognize. \"Are you saying these stories... they're real?\"\n\nThe librarian chuckled, the sound reminiscent of wind chimes in a distant breeze. \" reality is such a rigid concept, my dear. Imagine it as a canvas, and these tales as the brush strokes that color it. Some strokes are broad and vivid, others fine and delicate. They all leave their mark.\"\n\nThe woman's eyes widened, a flicker of disbelief mixed with a growing fascination. \"I've always dreamed of stepping into a story, of becoming a character in a tale. Could it truly be possible?\"\n\n\"Here, in this library,\" the librarian said, her voice taking on a reverent tone, \"where the boundaries of the real and the imagined blur, anything is possible. But remember, my child, the magic of the story is bound to the heart of the reader. It responds to the wishes, the fears, the dreams that live within you.\"\n\nWith trembling hands, the woman pulled the book from the shelf. The title glowed faintly, the letters shimmering like dew on a morning flower. The librarian watched, a smile playing on her lips, as the woman opened the book and stepped inside.\n\n---\n\nThe woman found herself in a world unlike any she had ever known. The sky was a tapestry of iridescent hues, and the air hummed with an unseen melody. Before her stood a handsome prince, his eyes the color of the twilight sky. \n\n\"Welcome, brave traveler,\" he said, bowing deeply. \"Your presence here is the answer to an ancient prophecy. Only you can save our realm from the shadow that threatens to consume it.\"\n\nThe woman stared at him, her heart pounding with a mix of terror and exhilaration. \"I... I don't know if I can. I'm just a reader, lost in a story.\"\n\n\"Here,\" the prince handed her a sword that seemed to shimmer with its own light. \"This sword was forged in the heart of the cosmos. Its power is bound to your will. Trust in yourself, and believe in the magic that brought you here.\"\n\nWith a deep breath, she took the sword, its weight comforting in her hands. Together, they embarked on a journey that would take them across enchanted forests, through the heart of a sleeping dragon's lair, and across the whispering sands of a desert alive with magic.\n\nAlong the way, she faced her deepest fears and discovered strengths she didn't know she possessed. The prince, a mere character in her favorite fairy tale, became her ally and, in time, her confidant.\n\n---\n\nDays turned to weeks, and weeks to months, as they battled the darkness that sought to claim their world. The woman, once a mere reader in a library, had become a hero in a land of magic and wonder.\n\nIn the depths of the final battle, as the shadow threatened to consume them all, she stood firm, her sword gleaming with an otherworldly light. It was then that she realized the truth the librarian had spoken of—the magic of the story was bound to her heart. Her dreams, her fears, her very being had given life to this world.\n\nWith a cry that shook the heavens, she struck the final blow, shattering the shadow and restoring balance to the realm. The prince, his face alight with admiration, knelt before her.\n\n\"You are not just a reader, but a weaver of destinies,\" he said. \"Your courage and your heart have saved us all.\"\n\nShe smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her that had nothing to do with the magic of the world around her. \"We saved each other. None of us could have done it alone.\"\n\n---\n\nAs the woman prepared to return to the library, the prince presented her with a gift—a mirror that showed not her reflection, but the world of her dreams. \"Carry this with you, and never forget the magic that lives within you.\"\n\nShe took the mirror, feeling a weight lift from her heart. \"I will never forget.\"\n\nWith one last look at the prince and the world she had come to love, she stepped through the portal that led back to the library. The librarian was there, her eyes twinkling with unspoken knowledge.\n\n\"Well, how was it?\" she asked with a knowing smile.\n\n\"The most wonderful adventure I could have ever imagined,\" the woman replied, her voice filled with wonder. \"Thank you for showing me this world.\"\n\n\"You are most welcome, my child,\" the librarian said. \"Remember, the library is always here, waiting for you to discover another world, another story. And who knows? Perhaps in one of these volumes, there is a tale waiting for you to write its ending.\"\n\nThe woman nodded, her heart full of gratitude and the promise of new adventures. As she wandered among the shelves, her fingers caressing the spines of the books, she knew that her journey had just begun.\n\n---\n\n**End**", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The response captures the distinct writing voice and intricate stylistic nuances of the reference text, maintaining consistency in tone, complexity, and emotional resonance throughout.

Which way do you point the lever to go down?\" Ryan was leaning over his desk. He was covered in sweat, and his hair was ruffled by his hands. His jacket laid on the chair behind him, and his shirt was untucked. Lilly was a few feet beside him with her head in her hands. The command center was a small shed on the edge of the dock where they shoved a radio, a desk, and a radar. The submersible was on a crane still hanging over the water.\n\n\n\"I push up,\" Jim said.\n\n\"Good. Now, how do you go right?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"I push…\" Jim paused, and Ryan held his breath.\n\n\"Isn't it obvious you moron. You push to the left,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"I was about to say that. I push to the left.\" Jim's confidence carried through the microphone.\n\n\"No.\" Ryan shook his head. \"You push to the right.\"\n\n\"Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. If up is down, then right should be left,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Pushing up causes the back of the submersible to go up, and the nose goes down. Pushing down causes the back to go down which makes the whole craft ascend. Right and left are normal. We've been over this five times,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"Well, it still makes no sense. This whole machine needs to be rewired,\" Olivia replied.\n\n\"It's still too late to do that. This is quite easy to learn. Plus, there's a manual in there. Why aren't you at least checking that before you answer?\n\n\"Checking before you answer is what suckers do. I go with my gut,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"But that makes no sense.\" Ryan took a deep breath. \"Alright, nevermind. Focus on the task at hand. How do you cause the craft to ascend?\" There was a long silence on the other end.\n\n\"You push the red button,\" Frida said.\n\n\"No, that fires the torpedoes.\"\n\n\"I thought that was turning the key,\" Polly said.\n\n\"You turn the key. Then, you push the red button. That's not important. Right now, we need to work on the basics. Like how would you ascend to the surface,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"I think we need to learn by doing. Let us off this crane and go into the water,\" Reid said.\n\n\"I'm not going to do that until I am sure that you won't wreck the machine. So I'll ask this one more time. How do you go up? There are only two options. Push the joystick up or push it down,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"We push it up,\" Jim said. Ryan pulled at his hair.\n\n\"Morons,\" Lilly muttered.\n\n\"I heard that,\" Frida shouted.\n\n\"Alright, you need more training before I let you go into the lake.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Polly said.\n\n\"No, I am in charge, and you go when I say you can go,\" Ryan yelled.\n\n\"And how long will that be?\" Reid asked.\n\n\"As long as it needs to be.\" Ryan shouted loud enough to be heard through the steel walls of the craft.\n\nAfter ten hours, the sun had set. Mice emerged from their burrows to consume the crumbs left by humans. Owls patrolled the skies searching for the aforementioned mice. Most people began to relax in preparation for sleep. A few took advantage of the starry night for romantic outings. Ryan and Lilly were stuck in the control room still instructing the new recruits on how to pilot a deep sea craft.\n\n\"And you shouldn't go deeper than 400 meters because?\" Ryan held his breath.\n\n\"Because pressure will get too high,\" Polly said.\n\n\"And high pressure causes?\" Ryan began to shake in excitement.\n\n\"The craft to be crushed like a can in the water,\" Reid replied.\n\n\"Yes, you got it.\" Ryan leapt out of his chair and began to dance. \"Now, get in the water and have some fun.\" He pressed down on the blue button before him. The claw released the submersible which landed with a large splash. It didn't descend any further.\n\n\"Which way do we push this joystick again?\" Jim asked.\n\n\"Oh no.\" Ryan's celebration stopped, and he collapsed on the ground crying. Lilly comforted him.\n\n\"No wait, we got it,\" Reid said. The hatch opened up top. \"Crap wrong button.\"\n\n\"It's okay everyone. It's in the manual,\" Polly said. Ryan overheard the debate from the radio and rocked back and forth.\n\n\"What have I done? Why did I think they were competent?\" Ryan said.\n\n\"It's okay. With luck, they'll die quickly,\" Lilly said.\n\n\"Polly, can I see that manual?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"No, it's mine.\" The radio filled with sounds of the two women arguing.\n\n\"Now, you both aren't getting it,\" Jim said. The manual was tossed out and landed in the water nearby.\n\n\"Hey!\" Polly shouted.\n\n\"At least we have more crafts,\" Lilly said.\n\n\"How are we going to explain the loss to command?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"We'll say it was an accident involving a mutant fish,\" Lilly replied. The radio static cleared as Reid's voice came through with a hint of triumph.\n\n\"I remembered how it descends.\" The submersible sank into the water slowly, but it's hatch was still open.\n\n\"Reid, I don't think this is supposed to be happening,\" Polly said.\n\n\"Just close it manually,\" Reid replied. Frida poked her head out of the hole and stared directly at Lilly. The two women held each other's gaze for an eternity in milliseconds before Frida closed the door, and the ship embarked on the journey.\n\n\"What's the likelihood of them returning in one piece?\" Ryan asked.\n\n\"That's not the desired outcome.\" Lilly bend the metal chair in front of her. \"The desired outcome is the ship's return with its crew destroyed.\"\n\n\"What the? That's impossible,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"I can hope,\" Lilly replied\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

This was the headquarters of the Crop Circle Cosmic Cracking Club, a secret society dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the universe through the creation of enigmatic crop circles. The club's motto? \"The key to the unknown is a good pattern and a strong back.\"\n\nHank, the president, stood in the center of the shed, wearing overalls and a cap with \"Gaia Guardian\" stitched above the bill. His hands were covered in mud from a particularly stubborn circle they were trying to form. Beside him was Sally, the club's resident physicist, her glasses slipping down the bridge of her nose as she squinted at the star map spread across an old, wooden table.\n\n\"Alright, team,\" Hank began, wiping his brow with the back of his glove, \"we've got one more attempt to recreate the Mandelbrot set. How do we get to the fractal dimension?\"\n\n\"I input the equation into the computer,\" Sally said, eyes still fixed on the star map.\n\n\"And then?\" Hank prompted.\n\n\"Then we push the green button,\" came a voice from behind a stack of old farm equipment.\n\nHank spun around to see Jim, the newest member, peering out from behind a rusty tiller. His overalls were covered in hay and dirt, and a grin split his face.\n\n\"Good. Now, how do we return to our own dimension?\" Hank asked, folding his arms.\n\n\"I think we push the red button,\" Polly piped up, emerging from the shadows with a dusty old laptop in her hands.\n\n\"No, that launches the club's secret satellite,\" Reid corrected, stepping out from behind a pile of old tires.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\" Lilly asked, joining them with a wrench in hand.\n\n\"It's in the manual,\" Olivia declared, pulling a tattered manual from her back pocket.\n\n\"Manuals are for losers. We go with the flow,\" Jim said, waving his hand dismissively.\n\n\"Alright, let's focus. We need to find the right sequence of button presses to toggle between dimensions,\" Hank said.\n\n\"Why can't we just use the quantum tuner?\" Reid asked, pointing to a dust-covered device on the table.\n\n\"Because it's broken,\" Sally replied, \"and until we fix it, we're at the mercy of these buttons.\"\n\nFor hours, the team argued over the correct sequence of button presses, each insisting their method was correct. The sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the shed, and the sounds of the countryside—crickets chirping, an occasional hoot of an owl—provided a comedic backdrop to their futile attempts.\n\nThe team's frustration peaked when, during a heated debate, Jim accidentally hit the red button, causing the shed to shudder and the lights to flicker ominously.\n\n\"Now what?\" Polly asked, her voice shaking.\n\n\"We're stuck here forever,\" Reid said, his usual cheerfulness replaced by despair.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Hank declared, \"we'll figure it out. We always do.\"\n\nAs the night fell and the stars came out, the team huddled around the table, their spirits unbroken despite the absurdity of their situation. They shared stories, laughter, and even a makeshift meal of cold sandwiches and stale chips, finding humor in their predicament.\n\nFinally, as the team was about to give up hope, a sudden burst of light filled the shed. They turned to see the crop circles glowing with an otherworldly light, the patterns shifting and morphing before their eyes.\n\n\"Did we do it?\" Lilly asked, her voice filled with disbelief.\n\n\"No, but it's a good start,\" Hank said, his face breaking into a wide grin. The team erupted in cheers, their exhaustion forgotten in the joy of their discovery.\n\nIn the end, the Crop Circle Cosmic Cracking Club didn't need a manual or the right sequence of button presses. They found their way home through the power of teamwork, laughter, and a shared sense of adventure.

{"id": "text_completion_038", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"horror\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: In order to move on, I need to grieve the lost years of my life and find a way to win the years to come. I think there is still time for me to undo the damage that has been done. I may not like doctors and nurses for what they did to me, but I have to put it aside and submit to the system again. It has gotten out of hand with this thing… I'm writing this to hopefully heal from the past and put these experiences behind me, even with him.\n\n\nTo put this into perspective, I want to briefly mention the bouts of psychosis I have dealt with in the past. This way it's clear that the thing I talk about later is a result of my mind deteriorating and nothing more.\n\nIt began with auditory hallucinations. Nothing big. I would be working and suddenly ‘someone' would ‘scream' in my ear. It was always one or two words, but so loud that I'd jump and look for the source. I don't remember most of the words but they were always derogatory. Sometimes it would yell my name right into my ear like I was in trouble. A few times it was a very loud ‘Bang!'\n\nThis gradually evolved into things like hearing TV static in the other room, people talking just out of sight, firecrackers off in the distance… but these were all things I could easily disprove to myself by investigating the sound.\n\nIt got more serious as I aged. More delusions began to pop up. I ‘knew' someone was in the corner of the room. I'd turn to check. No one. I'd get back to work, but feel something was there. Turn to check. Nothing. It never felt malicious only that I was being observed, that's why I didn't think it was a big deal, before my diagnosis.\n\nThere are more but I don't know about their relevance. I was convinced I was being assaulted in my sleep, that there were demons in me, bugs were under my skin… There were shadow people following me and sometimes I'd talk out loud to try and get them to go away… A lot of my delusions and hallucinations are too traumatic to bring up. I'll cry if I linger on those memories too much.\n\nThe only positive thing I did have growing up, and still now, is an overactive imagination. As a child, I delved into maladaptive daydreaming. Without getting into the trauma that occurred, I was completely isolated and left unattended most days. The imaginary worlds I created were all I had and so I welcomed anything my mind would provide to me as entertainment. While ‘daydreaming' and dissociating separated my reality from the abuse, it also exacerbated my delusions and hallucinations.\n\nOnce I was made aware that these things were not ‘normal' for everyone, and that the disorder I had was progressive, my life's mission was to do everything I could to keep my mind and body healthy. Reduce the symptoms by changing my lifestyle alongside the taking the medication.\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous. ‘How could you think everyone deals with that?!' But when someone says ‘I'm depressed' most people respond with ‘Oh yeah, I feel that.' I'd tell someone I hear voices that say awful things and the response would be ‘Ah, yeah, intrusive thoughts. I get those too.' In hindsight all of it seems obvious, but when the world is constantly reassuring you that you're ‘normal', you begin to think the ‘shadow people' in the basement is just the normal fear of the dark most people have… up until your mind snaps and suddenly it's ‘How could you not seek help?! You're so stupid! How did you not know?!'\n\nThat began my horrid journey through the healthcare system.\n\nI've been on many different medications to try and quell my symptoms and those medications have caused physical side effects that I am still living with. I gave so much trust to doctors, doing my best to be understanding and patient. Doctors and nurses are people too. However, I've only ever met dismissive medical staff in all my years.\n\nBefore inpatient, I always got the following:\nIt's just stress and anxiety.\nTake a self-care day.\nGet more Vitamin D.\nAre you sure you aren't thinking about it too much?\nGet more sleep.\nDrink less caffeine.\n\nI. Do. It. All.\n\nI lost the weight they told me would ‘help'. I ate the food they told me would ‘help'. I do the exercise they told me would ‘help'. So, how much extra work do I have to do, in order to get my life to the ‘normal baseline' that everyone else is at?\n\nOnce I grabbed the recommended vitamins out of my bag and shook it in a neurologist's face, after he told me that I was probably hormonal, on my period, and needed more vitamins – he didn't even look at my chart. I went in because I was rapidly losing weight for no reason and my hair was falling out.\n\n\"How many of these do I need to take and for how long?!\" I shoved the bottle at him. \"It's been years! How many more hoops do I need to jump through, before you people finally do something besides tell me that you don't know what it could be and send me home with nothing?!\"\n\nI paid for the appointment and went home empty-handed with a migraine, feeling nauseous and exhausted as my hair fell out in clumps. Doctors don't care.\n\nI went into the hospital once, telling them I was suicidal and slipping into delusions. My knick-knacks were ‘talking to me'. But because I didn't think they were influencing me or moving things in my home, I didn't get sent to inpatient. They locked me away in a glass room with an officer outside it. They did nothing but come back in occasionally and ask if I changed my mind. When I said I wasn't suicidal anymore, they let me go, alone, to drive home, and be alone at home. I was still delusional, they didn't give me anything no matter how much I asked because it was ‘drug seeking behavior, and that night I had the worst psychotic episode of my life.\n\nThat's a full-blown story for another day. I do sometimes wonder if he had anything to do with it...\n\nAll this to say, my faith in the medical field has slipped and I no longer want to communicate my issues to them beyond what I have already. That trust has been drained like my bank account. They got to take their frustrations out on me while I paid them to do it. They said things to my face that I'd never say to another human being, let alone to someone scared of themselves and everything around them.\n\nThere actually was a 2 month period of relief; I finally had found a medication cocktail that worked for me. The ‘thing' by the door was gone and the mirrors were safe to walk past was beautiful!\n\nI was living for first time in my life! I had spent thousands hopping from psychiatrist to psychiatrist, therapist to therapist, doctor to doctor. I got bloodwork done here, evaluations done there. Try this anti-psychotic, try that one. I was so miserable for so long, a guinea pig for them to mix medications together without thinking about how they'd interact in my system.\n\nIt nearly destroyed my physical health… This was why my hair was falling out, my teeth were wearing down from gastrointestinal issues, the vertigo was intense, my vision had failed for a few weeks on one prescription, another had given me such bad insomnia I was up for five days and my doctor still refused to take me off it…\n\nBut it finally felt like I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I cried over the years that were wasted. For the first time in my life, I had the sanity to realize just how bad it had gotten.\n\nIt didn't matter anymore, I could work on my physical health; the peace I had in my mind was worth the suffering.\n\n...Then it started again.\n\nYears ago, the intense stare of the ‘thing' by the door returned. Hearing people that weren't there when I would lay down in bed, seeing shadow people who wanted to do disgusting things to my body...\n\nThe cycle was going to have to start all over again. After knowing what life truly could be, the thought of regressing back into my old mindset was beyond devastating and overwhelming.\n\nIn a fit of mania, my wrist was slashed so deep I almost cut the nerves in my arm. There was blood splatter all around the room and it kept squirting out in bursts from my arm as my heart beat. The blood loss made me dizzy and nauseous, my vision blurred until all I saw were lights and shadows. My eyes closed and I was ready for everything to be over.\n\nAfter all these years, all the fear and suffering, this was what my brain truly wanted and I was going to give it that. I know he was there and saw me do it. I could feel him. The thing by the doorway… It was a delusion, but I indulged in the idea that he could be real as I succumbed to the bloodloss. I liked to believe that he took pity on me.\n\nThere were sirens off in the distance.\n\nI lived alone and hadn't called for help.\n\nWaking up in the ER, I was voluntold to go to inpatient for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nThey took pictures of my body to document any injuries or identifying marks and gave me an assessment. With hair that had thinned tremendously, eyes with dark purple bags, a stomach a bit distended from IBS, and fingers turned white from the cold of the ER, I was filthy from not taking care of myself. I must have smelled and looked pathetic.\n\nI had failed. Years of trying to be good and doing all the right things, I followed all the rules and put up with anything that was thrown my way and failed anyway.\n\nI was in the psychiatric ward.\n\nWhen I said I didn't like the medical system earlier… I was discussing dismissive doctors which was nothing compared to the inpatient staff. Those people not only made me feel like a burden to the system, but that I was disgusting and rotten. The staff would scoff, roll their eyes, or make fun of my memory issues. A few times the night shift staff would role play as us behind the front counter, poking fun of our symptoms or saying they'd ‘rather be dead'.\n\nThey would drug me to the point of passing out and seeing stars and then get aggravated when I couldn't get up for their check-ins. Edward, a friend I had made, got the same treatment. I could go on all day about that guy, he and Rosaline were my two buddies. They both are schizoaffective too for similar reasons and it was a relief to casually talk about our lives together without the judgment. Maybe I'll write about those guys later, but things got weird with them towards the end and I feel a little bad about it.\n\nAnyway, the ER had told my inpatient nurse to put a bandage over my cut when she cleaned and dressed it, in the morning and at night. ‘Why do you need this to be dressed like this?' She always complained. If she had read my file, she'd know why because I'm lucky I still have control over my left hand.\n\nI was ‘uncooperative' because I yanked my hand back when she tried putting the bandage down, but she was going to put the sticky part on my cut. I was scolded and she put the sticky edges over the cut out of spite. It pulled on the stitches and the goo from the bandage got into the crevasse of the cut.\n\nThat night, sobbing in my bed, the paper thin hospital clothes did nothing to keep me from freezing. My entire forearm was itchy and red; I realized she had never cleaned the wound with saline. It would turn bright white when poked, there was a burning sensation as it turned red again. I had tried to get help earlier but was told ‘come back when you can't move your wrist'. Not wanting to be written up again, I was trying to stick it out until morning. My other arm was covered in goosebumps and I trembled with no way to warm myself. The blanket was useless, as thin as my ‘clothes', but I still pulled it over my lower half.\n\nI felt something by the door but expected to see nothing as usual. That was the first time I saw him. Eyes swollen and filled with tears, my vision was blurry, but I could still make out a figure, hunched over and peering into my room. I frantically wiped my face with my hands, hoping it was just a trick of the light.\n\nOff-white skin glistened in the fluorescent overhead lighting from the hallway. Tinged pink in some places, yellow or green in others, deep purples resembling bruises were scattered over his body. It was as if someone had poorly sculpted a human figure from pure-white clay with messy hands, colors bleeding into the white as he was molded. There were even little dents, impressions on his skin, that resembled hundreds of little fingerprints. His limbs were curved or bent in a slightly unusual way, but not enough that it looked wrong. The off-white color of his lanky arms bled into a muddy red on his spider-like hands. His splotchy white legs were similar, leading to large, red feet.\n\nThe facial features were rudimentary, as if someone had taken a sculpting tool and sliced off what made him look human, leaving a flat surface. Large, black, marble-like eyes protruded from his face, thick pinkish-purple eyelids framed them. His large, red ears made me paranoid, like he could listen in on my thoughts as I analyzed him.\n\nHe had a shadow.\n\nIf he didn't, I could confirm it was my brain playing tricks on me, but his shadow grounded him in reality.\n\nFrozen in place, I didn't scream, telling myself over and over that I'd finally fallen off the edge. My mind had unraveled. I was shivering uncontrollably, doing my best to try and stay still but it only made me more tense. My hands and feet were like ice.\n\nI didn't know the best course of action and I was in awe at what my mind had created – because I knew, I knew this wasn't real.\n\nI was not going to close my eyes. Even blinking was scaring me, but I didn't want to keep my eyes open so long they'd dry out and I'd have to close them for longer… better for short and quick blinks, right?\n\nA quick blink. He was still, but tilted his head curiously.\n\nA quick blink. He seemed to be relaxing into his crouched position by the door.\n\nI started to relax, a little empowered that I was sticking it out and not becoming the problematic screaming patient like my poor friend Edward had a few nights ago. They'd sedated him so badly he didn't wake up for an entire day. I didn't want that to be me. I felt strong.\n\nA quick blink, and he still didn't make any sudden movements. I smiled to myself and decided the best course of action was to ignore him and go to bed. Before settling in, I tried to fluff the flat, stiff pillow. Collapsing with a sigh, I vowed to not open my eyes again and delve into my imagination instead. I wanted to ‘watch' something calm and comforting that night. Slowing my breathing, I heard a very light sound of sticky footsteps making their way to me and then there was a warmth.\n\nThe mattress dipped slightly, as if someone was leaning against the edge of the bed near my face. I was doing a good job of ignoring him, valiantly escaping into my own Wonderland, until it felt like something was prying its way into my skull.\n\nPlay the one about ‘The Willful Child'.\n\nUnable to resist any longer, I opened my eyes to see his face inches from my own.\n\n\"Ffff-!\" I instantly sat up and he pushed himself up slightly to continue to stay eye-level. There was a hollow pressure in my chest. Tears welled up in my eyes again.\n\nThe day had worn me down. My arm was screaming for attention. I tried to move my wrist and it was swollen in place.\n\nThis wasn't fair!\n\n\"Please... I'm so tired,\" was all I could muster with a sigh. I was unable to look him in the eyes, those black marbles. I opted to stare in the middle of his face where I finally noticed two little slits in the bruise-like pink splot there, like the remains of nose. He really did look like he was handmade. Smooth, dirty, white clay.\n\n\"I've never had a strong visual hallucination like this before.\" It felt like I had to say something. He leaned in slightly, as if trying to hear the words I was thinking rather than speaking.\n\nThere were so many things I could say, my mind was racing with thoughts but I couldn't grab a single one. I wasn't sure if I wanted to know more about where it came from or what it was… but I was scared of being hurt.\n\n\"Are you mad at me?\"\n\nGiving me a closed smile, he leaned back slightly. I nervously smiled back, ready to accept insanity until the morning. As I tried to even out my breathing, I blinked a few times and tears fell down my cheeks. The thing reached up to poke at them harshly, his nail pressed into my cheek, making me scrunch my face up. They were as clammy as they looked and his fingernails were pointed like little claws with dirt in the crevices.\n\nIt was annoying until I realized that he was tactile. Feeling his fingers prodding my face, I broke out in a cold sweat, shaking like a leaf.\n\nWhat level of crazy is it when you can start feeling things? I thought.\n\nThe room was starting to get blurry because the medication was starting to kick in, nausea hitting me.\n\nHe looked at his wet fingers, rubbing them together in thought, then he reached up again. That was my breaking point.\n\nI tried to scramble backwards on the bed and make space between us, convinced he was going to poke my eyes in. When I put pressure on my cut arm, heat surged from my arm to my brain like an electric shock, causing black and white spots to dot my vision. It was swollen, pulsing, and itchy, looking more like a stage prop than my forearm. I hissed and nearly fell backwards, off the other side of the bed.\n\nEither he moved too fast for me to get away or I was officially succumbing to the medication cocktail, a misshapen hand latched onto my bad arm and yanked me back towards him. I yelped, slapping my other hand over my mouth.\n\nHe inspected it. Putting his thumb on the bandage and pressing down hard, he cocked his head curiously and listened to me cry out in pain.\n\n\"Stop it. Stop. Please,\" I tried to reason with him. \"I'm so tired. I - I made a mistake coming here and thinking I'd get better. I need sleep.\" I swallowed the snot that was running down the back of my throat. \"Let me get better. Please.\"\n\nHis head swung up to stare straight into my eyes and lips parted to reveal its dull yet pointy teeth. Any confidence I had of it being a hallucination was long gone. I fully believed he was in front of me.\n\nA clammy hand snapped up to grab my face, it was big enough to wrap around my head. He shoved me back down onto my bed, my legs failed and I tried to grab at his arm to free myself. It didn't do much, he was too strong. My head was forced to rest against the flat pillow and I pulled my arms to my chest as a last ditch effort to protect myself from nothing.\n\nThrough the gaps in his fingers, I scanned the room searching for a clock, words on a poster, pamphlet, anything. I knew in dreams those things could be wonky. My vision was already bad, head aching, eyes stinging, and a dizzy spell was coming over me, so my efforts were futile. Removing his hand, he leaned over to fill my field of vision.\n\nShaking, I swallowed and stared back. He smiled warmly, taking enjoyment in my inebriated state, but sympathizing with it in a strange way. Unable to handle his vacant stare, I tried to make out what his skin could be made of.\n\nHis middle and index fingers were placed above my eyes and then he pushed my lids down. Eyes closed, I accepted whatever was going to happen but nothing did. His presence remained, the warmth he radiated eased the chill of the room more than the paper thin blanket ever could.\n\nI didn't want to picture him. So, I delved deep back into my own little world to keep my mind occupied until I fell asleep. He let out a pleased hum, as if that was what he wanted.\n\nThe next day, I bounced out of bed. It was the best sleep I had gotten in years. Years. In inpatient, I had the worst hallucination of my life but also got the best sleep I've ever had? Leaving the room and going into the common area for my medication, I saw my nurse. She was the same nurse from the day prior and I readied myself for her to roughly grab my arm and tear the bandage off of the stitches she pressed it into.\n\nI found her with her cart, engrossed in drawing on her clipboard. There was a chair positioned next to her, which was odd because everything had always been done standing up somewhere random in the ward. This was a comfortable corner by the window, undisturbed by the other patients and nurses, and the morning light was shining through to warm the area. The cart that carried her medical supplies and patients' medication was stationed next to her.\n\nI could still be dreaming… and could cry because this is is so… nice... I stepped into the warm and sighed in relief, rubbing my shoulders to rid myself of the excess cold.\n\n\"I, um, like your nail color today,\" I tried to be as polite as possible. \"It's pretty.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I wanted to try something new for a change,\" she raised her hand, as if she just noticed her freshly manicured nails herself. A lovely gradient of purples and reds. \"Sit down.\"\n\nI obediently sat down next to her, taking a peek at her clipboard. They weren't notes, just seemingly random doodles.\n\nTypical. I thought.\n\nShe chuckled and set the clipboard down.\n\nMy arm was gingerly taken by my wrist and turned over to view the cut. My jaw dropped. The redness and swelling was gone, the relief I had gotten from a good night's sleep made me forget how much pain I had been in. The bandage was also fixed, placed down diagonal so none of the edges touched the cut.\n\nEyes wide, my breath caught in my throat; it had been a dream. When the realization seeped in, I exhaled loudly and any tension in my body dissipated. Just a dream.\n\nShe gently peeled the bandaid off, discarding it in a small garbage bin kept on the lower level of her cart.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I smiled slightly.\n\n\"Your welcome.\" The nursed tilted her head up at me. Her eyes were completely black, bulging slightly, with purple bruising around them.\n\nMy jaw was stuck parted, drying my mouth and throat out. I knew it wasn't possible. She was being gentle and kind, the black eyes, the good night's sleep… maybe I had died?!\n\n\"No, silly,\" she chuckled, bringing out a syringe filled with saline and applied the liquid to my cut. \"I couldn't let that happen.\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond to that. ...Did I almost die?\n\nShe tutted. \"Strong will. Such a small little person, trying again and again. Willful little child. They're not kind to you, are they?\"\n\nMy heart was beating erratically causing my breathing to falter. \"I'm well past being a child.\"\n\n\"Aw, sweetie, don't be like that.\"\n\n\"What does it matter how staff treats me? ...Can you call Dr. Kasley? I'm seeing things again... and it's... worse.\"\n\nShe clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth. \"Do you think she'd care?\"\n\nThere was nothing I could say because my ‘nurse' was right. My doctor was the same one who over medicated me to the point of drooling in bed like a lobotomized patient last week, and they refused to ease up the dosage. A patient had tried to take advantage of me in my inebriated state and I was only saved by Rosaline, who came to get me for dinner.\n\nI didn't want to be a vegetable in bed again for the whole day.\n\n\"I can help with that for a price.\"\n\n\"I need something though,\" I genuinely needed some sort of medication – I wasn't stupid enough to forego what brought me sanity at one point in my life. As much as I hated the doctors, I still held out hope they cared somehow.\n\n\"Why,\" she spat. Holding the bandage over my cut, she turned it so it'd stick to my stitches.\n\n\"The-.\" I licked my chapped lips, and then whispered, \"the voices… I see and hear things.\"\n\nShe cocked her head. \"Only for the fake ones?\"\n\n\"...The fake ones?\" I wanted to run, something primal in me was screaming.\n\nWith a huff and an eye roll, she turned the bandage back so it'd avoid my stitches. \"I can be patient.\" She leaned back and pulled out a tiny clear cup with my pills in it. Before she handed them to me, she plucked out my anti-psychotic and broke it in half. I couldn't stop myself from reaching out to stop her, but her dead spherical eyes made me recoil. The mood stabilizer was also broken in half.\n\nShe offered me my reduced prescription. \"This is what you get.\"\n\nLicking my lips, I decided to press my luck. \"The anxiety one, the green one, it makes me feel nauseous. They give it to me just to put me to sleep and it doesn't help. Do I have to take it?\"\n\nThe ‘nurse' beamed and plucked the green pill from the clear container and popped it in her own mouth. Gasping, a raised a hand to stop her but the damage was done.\n\n\"I didn't like the one you played last night,\" she casually said, packing up her things on the cart.\n\n\"The… the what?\"\n\n\"You didn't play your usual story. I was disappointed.\"\n\nI spent the day trying to draw him, as best as I could. I wanted to capture how terrified I was at the time, but the longer I spent on it the more calming and comforting the image got. Nostalgic.\n\nEdward had come over to see what I was doing, but took one of my drawings and tore it up. It was so out-of-character for him I stood up and backed away, gathering my other drawings and retreating into my room.\n\nThat night I felt silly, sitting cross-legged in bed and facing the door. My nurse had returned to her old self and given me my anxiety medication so I was dozing off. Eventually it became too difficult to stay awake and I situated myself for sleep.\n\nThe bed grew warm and comfortable, it was so wonderful I wanted to cry in relief to be free from the cold again. ‘The Willful Child'. I like that one.\n\nAfraid of the consequences, yet eager to please the one ray of light I had, I began to visualize the story in my head. It's one I always liked to make my own little visuals for…A Grimm's Fairytale that I relate to heavily.\n\nAnd… and...I actually don't think this helped at all. I'm ashamed that, after revisiting this again, I only feel sentimental and more confident I my decision. Even if he's not real, he's the nicest thing that's happened to me in years, the nicest delusion or hallucination I've ever had… I know he's not real though, so there's still sanity left in me. As long as I know he's not, he can stay.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of horror.\n3.

I was alone in the world, the sound of my own breathing a mocking symphony in the silence that stretched endlessly around me. It wasn't the kind of loneliness that can be easily remedied with the company of others; it was an existential kind, a loneliness that seemed to come from the very fabric of my being. I was a ship adrift in a sea of shadow, with no stars to guide me home.\n\nThe first time I heard the whispers, I thought it was just my imagination running wild. They were soft at first, mere ghosts of sound that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere all at once. But as weeks turned into months, the whispers grew louder, more insistent, until they became a constant companion I could no longer ignore.\n\nI tried to tell the doctors about the whispers, about the fear that gripped me every night as I lay in bed, listening to the shadows that seemed to come alive in the dark. They wrote it off as a symptom of my anxiety, a side effect of the medications they kept piling on me. They were dismissive, convinced that the only thing wrong with me was my imagination.\n\nBut the whispers didn't stop.\n\nThey took on a tangible form. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, a play of shadows on the wall. But the more I looked, the more I realized that there was something there, something that wasn't part of the darkness. A figure, hunched and twisted, its face a mask of shadow and light, eyes like coal black holes staring directly into my soul.\n\nI began to see things in the corners of my room, flickers of movement that didn't make sense. Objects moved on their own, voices came from nowhere, and the air grew thick with an oppressive weight that made it hard to breathe. The whispers turned into words, words that spoke of things I didn't want to hear, things that made my blood turn cold.\n\nI was losing my mind. And I knew it.\n\nThe nightmares began. Every night, without fail, I would wake up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding in my chest, the sound of the whispers ringing in my ears. I would lie there, paralyzed, unable to move, as the figure in the corner of my room watched me with an eerie, knowing gaze.\n\nIt was in one of these nights, in the depths of my despair, that I met him.\n\nHe was a vision of nightmare, a grotesque abomination that defied description. His skin was a sickly gray, mottled with dark splotches that seemed to cling to him like a second skin. His eyes burned with an inner fire that seemed to sear into my very being, and his mouth opened in a silent scream that echoed through my mind.\n\nI knew then that I was truly lost, that I had crossed a line that could never be uncrossed. The figure in my room was not a product of my imagination, not a side effect of my medication, but a real, living being that had found its way into my world.\n\nThe nights grew worse. The whispers became screams, the shadows became things, and the figure in my room became a constant companion, ever-watchful, ever-hungry. I tried to resist him, to push him away, but he was too strong, too determined.\n\nAnd then, one night, everything changed.\n\nI woke up in the hospital, my body aching, my mind a jumbled mess of fear and confusion. The doctors told me I had had a breakdown, a psychotic episode that had landed me in a place I never wanted to be. But deep down, I knew it was more than that.\n\nI saw him, in the corner of my room, watching me with a expression that was almost… amused. He said nothing, but his gaze spoke volumes. I was his plaything, his toy, and he was going to enjoy every minute of it.\n\nThe days turned into nights, and the nights into endless horrors. The medications the doctors prescribed did little to dull the edges of my reality, and the figure in my room grew more real with each passing day. I was losing my grip on sanity, my mind slipping away to a place where only the shadows lived.\n\nI tried to reach out for help, but no one believed me. They saw me as a danger to myself, a liability that needed to be contained. I was shut away, locked in a world of my own making, with no way out.\n\nAnd then, one night, the figure spoke to me.\n\nHis voice was a chilling whisper that cut through the darkness, a sound that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. He told me things I didn't want to hear, things that made my blood run cold. He spoke of things that had happened in the past, things that I had no memory of, things that shouldn't have been possible.\n\nI realized then that my reality was not the only reality. There were other worlds, other dimensions, where things that defied logic and reason lived and breathed. I was a bridge between those worlds, a conduit through which the shadows could cross into our world.\n\nThe figure in my room was just the beginning. There were others, entities that fed on fear and despair, that thrived on the pain of those they tormented. They were everywhere, hidden in the shadows, waiting for their chance to cross into our world and wreak havoc.\n\nI tried to resist them, to push them away, but they were too strong. They had found a way into my mind, and they weren't going to let go easily.\n\nThe nights became a living nightmare, with the whispers and screams of the entities filling my mind. I was constantly on edge, constantly afraid, living in a world where the shadows were alive and the darkness was a place of refuge.\n\nEventually, I gave in. I embraced the darkness, welcomed the entities into my world. I became one of them, a vessel through which they could cross into our world and feed on the fear and despair of others.\n\nThe doctors said I was lost, that I had given up on my own life. But I knew the truth. I had found a way to escape the horror that had become my reality, a way to find peace in a world where there was none.\n\nAnd in the end, I was at peace. I had found a way to escape the horrors that had haunted me for so long, and I had found a way to live in a world where the shadows were no longer a threat.\n\nBut in my heart, I knew that I had given up on my own life. I had traded my humanity for a place of safety, and I knew that I would never be able to go back.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the tone and style of the reference story to a considerable extent but not perfectly.

{"id": "text_completion_039", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Misc Fiction\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Ding.\n\n\nDear Sarah.\n\nI remember the day we got our first microwave. My dad said he bought it at goodwill. For all I know he probably had a line of credit there. They still had lines of credit that were simply kept in a notebook behind the counter. My dad knew everyone, and he helped everyone, so it wouldn't surprise me that his credit was good everywhere in the city.\n\nHe was the guy who delivered the milk and other dairy stuff to all the grocery stores, the bodegas, the corner marts and what not. And then he did gumball machines and little trinket machines. When he first started, they were a nickel each. Then ten cents. Then a quarter. Put the coin in, turn the knob, and open the little latch and there's your stuff. Then he started delivering milk to all the schools and and refilling the little candy and trinket machines as well.\n\nLines of credit turned into layaway, where you could put money down on something and just come in and pay it off slowly over time and pick it up when you were paid off. They just held your thing in a room of things other people put on layaway.\n\nEventually that got too be too much space being used for layaway, especially because companies didn't charge interest (because it was a free service) and store credit cards became a thing. Now you just buy whatever you want and pay it off over time with a bunch of interest tacked on. It makes stores a ton of money and gives that instant gratification to people willing to pay out the nose in interest for things. It also makes people buy a lot of shit they don't need.\n\nBefore my dad made really good money, nothing we ever got was in it's original box or packaging. Not even Christmas and birthday presents. Nothing was ever new, and sometimes we didn't know if it worked until he brought it home. We didn't care. This was the first microwave he ever brought home. I wonder if he found it on the side of the street on the way home from work.\n\nI've probably owned a dozen microwaves since that day, but none of them were like this. To me, this was a behemoth of a box of metal and glass. It probably weighed at least twenty pounds. The first time I opened it up, I pulled the door down and stuck my head in it to see if it fit. I was seven, what else would you expect? Besides, it looked like a regular oven but smaller. Even opened like a regular oven. It was beautiful.\n\nThe microwave had a big dial, a little dial, and a button. The big dial went up to thirty minutes. What the heck takes thirty minutes to cook in a microwave? There was a smaller dial for \"power\" and we never took it off the full power option. Under that was just a little square start button. You had to push it in about half an inch to get it to start. Sometimes you had to press it a couple times.\n\nMy mom pulled me gently out of the microwave as I was looking at all the holes inside it and she closed the door. She said this is dangerous and gets hot. I was seven, so I knew what hot meant. I just couldn't figure out how it got hot. I just knew it got hot for only thirty minutes at a time.\n\nThat Amana Radaranger moved with my parents to four different apartments. When they moved into their last apartment, my cousin dropped it and it never worked again. We were in such a rush to move that time, my mom didn't even clean it out.\n\nMy dad wasn't upset. My mom was a little upset but the next day she got a brand new microwave with buttons on it and a digital clock. It came in it's original box brand new from walmart. I don't remember the brand, and I know it only lasted a couple years. This was just before my dad had started to make a little money. It was a couple months later bought the new trucks and hired a few guys to drive and deliver.\n\nAnd this is when we met. Right before my dad \"hired\" me as an adult. Before that, I was with him in his truck every day, meeting the customers and helping him fill the machines and dump the coins into bags. Back then, you could do this and not get jumped or mugged. It was a lot of fun for me.\n\nIt was summer, I had just graduated high school and we met at one of the little corner stores my dad had just gotten as a new customer. While he was talking to the owner, I was trying to figure out how to have a conversation with you. It was just us in the store, on a quiet rainy Wednesday morning. Your dad owned the store, and both of them were in the back discussing who knows what. I said hi. You blushed a little and said hi. I said nice shop. I asked you how long the store had been open. You said a couple months. You had just moved from Michigan and your dad bought the building from one of his cousins.\n\nWe had a little small talk. I told you my name, you told me your name was Sarah. We talked about the store and my dad's business, and summer time and whether you were going to the town pool on the nice days or to the park or what not. I told you there was a skating rink in town and you hadn't been there long enough to know that. I felt kinda good that I let you know. I also wondered if you thought I was just hitting on you or something, but we were both still kids back then, so did it really matter?\n\nI was just about to ask you if you wanted to go to the skating rink on Friday night and our dad's come out of the back room talking about something. I was leaning over the counter, you were leaning over as well, and there was still a couple feet between us. We stood up straight and both of us blushed. You blushed way more and looked way more beautiful than me, I'm sure. Our dads didn't even notice.\n\nThe following Wednesday, which became the day of the week that I got to see you, you were there in your dad's store. Your hair looked different and I swear your lips looked a little pink. You were wearing something pretty. Our dads went in the back room again for about twenty minutes this time and I never thought how odd this was. He never went in the back room with anyone for more than a few minutes at best. And usually never even did that.\n\nThis time, I went right into the skating rink and asked you if you wanted to come on Friday. You asked me if this was a date. I said yes, yes it is a date. I'd like to take you on a date. To the skating rink. I heard something drop in the back, or a hand lightly smacking a desk, and a chair scratching the floor, but was unfazed. My eyes were locked on yours, and yours on mine. You had these beautiful brown and golden eyes, and I had these muted grey/blue eyes. I hated my eyes, but I loved them for what they were seeing right then and there.\n\nI borrowed my dad's truck and picked you up at your dad's store. We drove the eight minutes to the rink in near silence. We were both smiling. I came around and opened your door, took your hand, and walked you into the skating rink. We listened to the music and watched the lights shine different colors all over the floor, and the disco ball lights changing colors every few seconds. We stopped for pizza and soda and then went back out. We talked most of the time about everything two almost adult kids talk about. I listened to your stories about back home, and I told you about living here. We stopped again for ice cream and I don't remember letting go of your hand at all that night except when we were eating.\n\nAt ten pm sharp I dropped you off at your house. That was your curfew on Friday nights. My dad told me I had better be home at 10:10, which was plenty of time to walk you to and kiss you at your front door. It was a very short and sweet kiss. I held the side of your cheek gently and you smiled.\n\nI said see you Wednesday and you said see you Wednesday. And for the most part, that became our parting words for the next few months. Even when we made plans to go on our dates on the weekends, at the store, it was always see you Wednesday.\n\nI met you on a Wednesday, I asked you out on a Wednesday and I asked you to marry me on a Wednesday. Today's Wednesday and we just signed on our first house. The first thing I did is buy you the most expensive microwave I could find and had it installed over the stove. I just wanted to let you know why I was so giddy about it. I know, sometimes I can be a bit nostalgic and giddy over little silly things. I just wanted to know why it was kind of special to me. And why you're kinda special to me.\n\nI love you.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

It was a sunny Saturday morning, and the air was filled with the scent of freshly cut grass. Our family had just moved into a new house, and it felt like the beginning of something wonderful. Little did I know, it was the day we'd find something truly extraordinary.\n\nDad had always been a handsy man, always tinkering with something, fixing what wasn't broken. That day, he found an old, dusty box in the attic. Curiosity piqued, he pulled it down, and to our surprise, it was a vintage typewriter. Its metal body was dented, the keys a bit worn, but there was something enchanting about it.\n\nI remember the sound of the keys clicking, the paper feeding through with a satisfying crinkle. It was like stepping back in time, to an era when words were typed, not typed. Dad had it refurbished, and soon it became the heart of our home, a place where our family's stories were captured, cherished.\n\nAs the seasons changed, so did our lives. I grew older, my voice deepened, and my interests shifted. But that typewriter remained, a constant in our ever-changing world. It witnessed my first short story, my sister's poetry, and even my parents' love letters.\n\nOne day, as I was typing furiously, trying to meet a school deadline, the power went out. The electric hum of our home faded, leaving only the soft clack-clack of the typewriter. It was then I realized, this old machine had a magic all its own. It wasn't just a tool for writing; it was a conduit for creativity, a source of comfort and inspiration.\n\nAnd then, we met. It was on a crisp autumn day, at a local bookstore's open mic night. I was there to read a piece I'd written on that very typewriter, and you were there, captivated by the words, the rhythm, and the man behind them. Our eyes met, and in that instant, I knew. It was like finding the perfect key for a long-lost lock.\n\nWe talked for hours, about our favorite books, our dreams, and the magic of storytelling. That night, as I drove you home, the stars shone brighter, and the world seemed a bit more magical. We exchanged numbers, and from that day forward, our Wednesdays became the most anticipated days of the week.\n\nEach week, we'd meet at the bookstore, our typewriters clacking away, filling pages with our thoughts, our dreams, and our love for each other. It was a simple routine, yet it felt like a dance, a beautiful waltz between two kindred spirits.\n\nToday, as we stand in our new home, I want you to know why I'm so giddy about this microwave. It's not just because it's the latest model, or because it's the most expensive. It's because it reminds me of that old typewriter, of the beginnings of our story, and of the endless possibilities that lie ahead.\n\nJust like that typewriter, this microwave will be a witness to our lives, a tool we'll use every day, but more than that, it's a symbol of our journey together. It's a reminder that even the simplest things can hold the most profound meanings, and that sometimes, the most ordinary objects can become the most extraordinary treasures.\n\nI love you, Emily. Thank you for being my muse, my partner, and my everything. Here's to many more Wednesdays, many more stories, and many more memories.\n\nWith all my love,\n\nAlex", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference text well.

Cotard's Syndrome\n\n\nMy new doctor - a bright and friendly guy named Sarbjit - took the time to explain his diagnosis to me. He told me my condition was mental, not physical, but it was hard to pay attention to everything he said because my left arm was numb and rotting from the inside out. I smiled and nodded and then when I got home I looked up Cotard's Syndrome online. Here is what Wikipedia had to say on it.\n\n\"Cotard's syndrome, also known as ‘Cotard's delusion' or ‘Walking Corpse Syndrome', is a rare mental disorder in which the affected person holds the delusional belief that they are dead, do not exist, are putrefying, or have lost their blood or internal organs.\"\n\nI don't know. Sounded extremely strange to me. I just knew my left arm was dying. Maybe my liver too. I used my right arm, the good one, to open my mail. Most of it was just the normal stuff but when I saw the letter from the Supreme Court of the State of New York I got a little worried. I was here legally - a citizen for almost ten years now - and I knew my rights but being summoned to testify at this criminal trial was a bit unnerving. I didn't like it. I just try to do my best in this life and mind my own business and not cause problems for others.\n\nWhen my trial appearance date arrived two months later I took the subway downtown and left my assistant, Stavvy, in charge of the office that day. I sat there on a hard wooden bench in the courtroom all morning listening to the testimony of other witnesses but I wasn't called to the stand until sometime after we returned from lunch. Eventually, the lawyer for the defense called my name.\n\nShe mispronounced it of course - people here always mispronounce Albanian names - so I wasn't surprised when she called me Mister Shka-Rell-Eee. My surname is Shkreli, after the place where my family comes from, and the proper pronunciation contains only two syllables - Shkrell-Eee. I was trying to hold my left arm in place when she asked her opening question.\n\nWhere was I at the time of the murder?\n\n\"Well, Miss Anderson\" - I pronounced it Ahnd-REE-Sawn, drawing out the first and last syllables while placing too much emphasis on the middle one, intentionally - \"I am not entirely certain. That was over a year ago and I travel all around this city on a daily basis for my job. I work in computer repair and IT support and I have customers in all five boroughs.\" (This wasn't exactly true. I wasn't really willing to travel to Staten Island.) We had spoken four months earlier when she informed me of the questions she intended to ask at trial but I was fairly oblique then and I intended to remain so now. I had bigger problems. Could these people not see that my left arm was rotting away?\n\nShe looked at me with a furrowed brow and briskly walked back to the defense table, picked up a leather-bound notepad and opened it.\n\n\"Mister Shkreli, when you and I spoke on June 18th you confirmed that you were just leaving a client's office, TRG Commercial Realty, located at 223 Broome Street here in lower Manhattan at approximately 3:30pm that day, shortly before the incident at issue took place less than one block away. Is that not correct?\"\n\nI turned up my native eastern European accent a bit and repositioned my left arm in my lap. I could barely feel it at that point. What was wrong with these people?\n\n\"If you say so. Like I said, that was over a year ago and it was just another workday for me.\"\n\nShe stared at me for a beat or two longer than necessary and then flashed a quick look towards the jurors before continuing.\n\n\"Well yes, Mister Shkreli\" - again it was Shka-Rell-Eee - \"You did tell me that and I do have a recording of our conversation, which you consented to before we began, if the court would like this to be entered into evidence?\"\n\nShe looked at the judge and the judge looked at me.\n\n\"Mister Shkreli,\" - he too pronounced it Shka-Rell-Eee - ‘Are you refuting the testimony that Miss Anderson is referencing during your preliminary deposition or can we just move on at this point? If counsel for the defense claims to have this recording I am fairly certain this is true. Will it be necessary to enter this recording into evidence at this time or are you willing to acknowledge Miss Anderson's claim?\"\n\nI repositioned my left arm in my lap and nodded.\n\n\"That's fine, Your Honor. As I said, it was just another workday for me but if Miss Anderson says that is what we discussed I am sure she is probably right.\"\n\nThe judge nodded back at me. \"Very good. Let's proceed then.\"\n\nMiss Anderson walked back to the defense table and dropped the leather-bound notepad before continuing with her final question for me, looking annoyed.\n\n\"Picking up where we left off, Mister Shkreli, can you please describe for the court what happened immediately after you left the offices of TRG Commercial Realty at 223 Broome Street on the date in question, October 22nd of last year?\"\n\nI didn't like the way that she was trying to fence me in but I wasn't particularly concerned. I had bigger problems.\n\n\"Well, like I said, I don't really remember that day. There was nothing memorable about it. It was just another day.\"\n\nShe stared at me for a few seconds then flashed a quick look at the jury box with her eyebrows raised before returning her attention to the judge. \"No more questions, Your Honor.\"\n\nI was dismissed from the stand but asked to remain in the courtroom as she called her next witness; a small, frail woman from Queens about my same age named Maureen Stewart. She had an odd, twitchy nature about her. I wanted to get home. I wanted to relax.\n\n\"Miss Stewart, can you please tell the court where you were on October 22nd of last year at approximately 3:30 in the afternoon?\"\n\nThe witness looked down for a moment and then glanced towards the judge before removing the slightly confused look from her face and responding in a semi-automated tone.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Anderson. At that time, I was just leaving my day shift at the FedEx Office Store (she pronounced it ‘Staw' in her thick New York accent) on Broome Street and I was walking towards the station for the Six Train to begin my ride back home.\"\n\nThe attorney for the defense took a momentary pause and then asked her next question.\n\n\"And can you please tell us what happened then?\"\n\nThe witness looked down again and then looked back at the judge, then the jury and, finally, at me. I didn't like the way she looked at me.\n\n\"Yes, as I was leaving my workplace I crossed the street and I remember walking past the entrance to a narrow alleyway where I heard a commotion taking place. It made me stop and look for a second or two but I didn't want to get involved so I just kept on walking towards the subway and I didn't think too much about the whole thing until the Homicide detectives contacted me a few days later after they pulled the security camera videos. I came down to the police station the day after that and gave my statement. That was just over a year ago.\"\n\nMiss Anderson took a moment to stare at me. I didn't like that either. I adjusted my left arm in my lap. It was completely numb.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Stewart. Can you please be a bit more specific about what you saw occurring in that alleyway?\"\n\nAgain, the witness looked down at the floor and then her eyes shot all around the courtroom before she responded.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, before taking a brief pause. \"At first I thought it was just a little scuffle but when I saw the shorter man in the black jacket punch the tall man in the belly a few times I saw some blood starting to spread on the side of his white button-down shirt and I saw what looked like a small knife or something in the shorter man's hand. The tall thin man looked like he was starting to fall. I remember looking around for a police officer but I certainly wasn't gonna do anything about it by myself. I mean, what could I do? When I didn't see no one who could help I just kept on walking towards the subway. I guess I should have done more but I was scared and I just wanted to get back to Forest Hills to pick up my daughter from daycare before five o'clock.\"\n\nI glanced at the defendant seated at the table on the left. He looked both hopeful and nervous at the same time, but in a subtle way, like he didn't want to appear to be either. He kept his head down and never once glanced towards the jury box. Miss Anderson asked her final question.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Stewart. And do you see the man in the black jacket who stabbed the victim, Mister Baronston, on that day last October here in the courtroom now?\"\n\nAgain the witness looked down at the floor between her feet for a moment and then looked back up, right at me. I felt my blood stop flowing through my veins, or at least through my left arm and the top of my right leg, when she raised up her hand and pointed her index finger at me.\n\n\"It was that man, there,\" she said.\n\nMiss Anderson nodded and paused for a moment, satisfied, letting it sink in for the jury members. I was stunned. The stylish defense attorney in the toney, expensive clothing began walking back in my direction and she too pointed an accusatory finger.\n\n\"If it pleases the court, let the record show that Miss Stewart has identified Mister Jack Shkreli as the attacker who she witnessed in the-\"\n\nJust then the witness on the stand, Miss Stewart, pointed her finger at the judge without really looking at him and suddenly blurted out, \"Or him. It might have been him too. I'm not 100% sure...\"\n\nMiss Anderson paused, clearly nonplussed, and just stared at her witness. The judge also looked baffled for a second or two and then leaned over and whispered something to his court assistant and the two of them shared a quiet smirk.\n\nThen the witness pointed at one of the jurors, a man in the front row about my size.\n\n\"Or him. It could have been him. I'm just not sure...\" Then she went silent, as did the rest of the courtroom for a few moments. The State's Attorney, a heavy-set bald man, broke the silence pretty quickly as he rose to his feet.\n\n\"Your Honor, the State would like to move to dismiss this witness along with all previous testimony.\" He paused briefly and took a deep breath, choosing his next words.\n\n\"While we appreciate Miss Stewart's willingness to appear at trial today, I think it's clear that her recollection of events is…uncertain at best.\" He glared at the defense table for a moment, then added \"I'd just like to remind the court that Mister Shkreli\" - and God bless him, he pronounced my two-syllable surname correctly - \"is not on trial here and if this witness cannot distinguish the man she saw that day from yourself or a random member of our jury panel I don't think we can accept this testimony or any further testimony from this witness.\"\n\nHe hung his head respectfully, with the tiniest little smile on his face. He already knew he had won this argument and the judge quickly agreed, telling the jury to disregard what they just heard. Miss Stewart was dismissed from the stand and the defense had no other witnesses left to call. Less than two hours later the jury returned a guilty verdict against the defendant on all counts and the courtroom was cleared. The sentencing hearing would take place at a later date and I was not required to be there. My right leg was starting to feel numb by then but I still managed to get back to the office in time for Stavvy to head home at the end of his shift to make dinner for his kids. His wife was killed in a car accident two years earlier. He was a hard worker and I really liked him.\n\nThat night, back at my apartment, I did some research online and learned about a rare mental disorder known as Prosopagnosia. Here is what Wikipedia had to say.\n\nProsopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a cognitive disorder of face perception in which the ability to recognize familiar faces, including one's own face (self-recognition), is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g. object discrimination) and intellectual functioning remain intact.\n\nIt all sounded pretty strange to me but if the doctors say it's real who am I to argue? Apparently it is well documented in the DSM-5. I don't know if this is the reason why I was able to walk away from the courtroom without consequence at first but I think it is the most likely explanation. I only know that when I left my client's offices at TRG Commercial Realty on that day just over a year ago and hailed a cab I was stunned and confused when Mister Baronston, a complete stranger with a hostile face, suddenly attacked me, claiming that it was his cab and not mine.\n\nHe was bigger than me, tall and thin but strong, and I would have just given up the cab and caught the next one but he was clearly already very angry about something. When he backed me towards the alley, shoving me and then punching me around my head and neck, my backpack tumbled open and I saw my wallet and phone and some other items come crashing out onto the pavement. It was just a stupid and unnecessary altercation, the kind of thing that probably happens on the streets of this city every day, sadly. Too many people, not enough space. I did my best to fight back and protect myself but he was a good deal bigger than me.\n\nThen I was getting punched some more and thrown against the alley wall as people passed by, disinterested, and I just instinctively reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out the pen knife that has been attached to my keychain for years. Before I really knew what was happening it was open and then my right hand was growing warm and red and slick with his blood. Then I was moving again, not looking back.\n\nWhat an odd thing. I remember seeing Miss Stewart stopping there on the sidewalk to look from the mouth of the alley that day. Of all the passers-by, she was the only one who paused to look at us, at me, right as I desperately punctured Mister Baronston's rib cage for the fifth or sixth time with my little penknife and he began to drop, but she averted her gaze after a few seconds and moved on and then I was rapidly heading in the opposite direction. This is a huge city and I never expected to see her face again. Fortunately, she was apparently never really able to see mine.\n\nAnyway, I have more important problems to worry about at this time. Stavvy received a letter from the Manhattan DA's office yesterday ordering him to appear at a grand jury hearing next month related to my involvement in Mister Baronston's death. He showed it to me. More importantly, my left arm is just about gone now, my right leg is quickly starting to feel the same way and in just the last day or two I have begun feeling that strange tingling sensation in the tips of the fingers on my right hand. I know my liver is failing. It won't be long now.\n\nI scheduled a meeting with my lawyer in the morning to legally put the business and the rest of my assets in Stavvy's name in my will. I have no family here anyway and almost no relatives who I remain close with back in Albania or Montenegro anymore. Stavvy is a good man and he has kids to feed and I have already lived a full life.\n\nSo yes, I will just leave it all to him and after that's done I think I will get the old Ford minivan that we sometimes still use for the business and drive it out to the George Washington Bridge while I am still able. I know that when I stop it and get out and leave it there on the center-span I will screw up traffic badly and inconvenience a lot of people but I can't worry about that. I have to do what I have to do. There's no point in waiting for this to get worse. I can barely feel the fingers on my right hand and I don't have much time left.\n\nMaybe I should have told the truth at the trial. I don't know. I think I was just too distracted by all of my health problems. I didn't really have any choice at the time. I don't have any choice now. I'm actually surprised that I lasted this long. I was certain that I would already be gone a few months ago but I feel I have done my best with this life.\n\nAs my people back in Albania say, Mos pyet si vdiq, por si rrojti!\n\n\"Do not ask how he died, but how he lived!\"\n\nTHE END\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

His name was Orion, a name that whispered of the cosmos yet shackled him to the mundane. He was a man enigmatic, with eyes that seemed to pierce through veils and a voice as soft as the echoes of a forgotten cavern. Orion, however, harbored secrets darker than the night sky he so often studied.\n\nOrion led a solitary life, his world confined within the four walls of his apartment. He was a man of few words, and those he uttered were always measured, as if each one carried a weight too heavy for the casual listener. His hands, once nimble and quick, now moved with the hesitation of an aged artist.\n\nOne evening, as the city bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun, Orion received an anonymous letter. The envelope was void of any return address, the paper within it yellowed with age. The script was elegant yet foreboding, a message that seemed to whisper directly into Orion's soul. \"The truth lies buried, but the shadows know.\"\n\nThe very next day, an eerie silence befell Orion's usually bustling neighborhood. It was as if the city held its breath, anticipating the unveiling of a long-concealed truth. Orion, with a heart pounding in his chest, ventured out, drawn by an inexplicable force.\n\nHis journey led him to the old, cobweb-laden library at the city's forgotten edge. The books within were ancient, their spines cracked, their pages yellowed. Orion's fingers traced the spines until they paused at a volume that seemed to call out to him. The book was a journal, its pages filled with the scribbles of a mind long lost to time.\n\nAs Orion delved into the journal, the world outside faded away. The words within painted a picture of a city haunted by a mystery that had long Since been buried beneath the sands of time. It spoke of a crime, a murder that had never been solved, a story that the city had forgotten, but the shadows remembered.\n\nThe journal's last entry was a date, a time, and a place—a rendezvous at the old, disused train station on the outskirts of the city. Orion's heart raced as he realized the significance of this meeting. It was a chance to uncover the truth, to shed light on the darkness that had shrouded his city for years.\n\nAs he made his way to the station, the air grew thick with anticipation. The station was a ghost town, abandoned and forgotten, yet it seemed alive with the whispers of the past. Orion stood at the appointed spot, his breaths shallow, his heart a drumbeat in his chest.\n\nThen, from the shadows emerged a figure, cloaked in darkness, their face hidden by the depths of the night. Orion's instincts flared, his senses alert, yet his curiosity drove him forward. The figure spoke in hushed tones, their words laced with the weight of truth.\n\n\"The city's darkness is its secret keeper. The truth you seek lies not in the light but in the shadows. The truth is a tale of betrayal, of love lost, of a murder that shook the city to its core. But the truth is also a tale of redemption, of courage, and of a city that rose from the ashes of its past.\"\n\nOrion stood there, the weight of the truth pressing down on him. The city's secrets, long buried, were finally surfacing. The darkness that had haunted the city was not a curse but a guardian of its forgotten tales.\n\nAs the figure faded into the night, Orion knew that his journey had just begun. The truth was a tapestry woven from the threads of the city's past, and it was his destiny to unravel it. With each step he took away from the station, he felt the shadows lift, the city's hidden stories waiting to be told.\n\nThe path ahead was fraught with mystery and suspense, but Orion was ready. The truth, no matter how dark, was a beacon that guided him forward. The city's secrets were his to uncover, and he would do so, one step at a time, into the heart of the unknown.\n\nAnd so, Orion's journey unfolded, a tale of mystery and suspense, a quest for the truth that lay hidden in the shadows of his city. The truth was a legacy that the city had forgotten, but Orion would remind it, one whisper at a time.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures some of the stylistic nuances of the reference text, such as the use of detailed descriptions and a mysterious tone.

As if you can talk about the inanity of a conversation with someone without the slightest recognition that you yourself are just as bad. I know I'm as bad as everyone else. I partook in those conversations whenever the necessity arose. But I find myself far more at home consuming knowledge that has actual value. Pouring over various encyclopedia's and old novels. Sure, the information in an encyclopedia from two hundred odd years ago is out of date. It was probably wrong by the objective nature of reality at the time of its writing. But it has stood the test of time far better than any conversation you can hold with the common people of this day and age.\n\n​I'm well known around Deteram Library. The staff don't bother me, they know I prefer my quiet and I always put my books back exactly where they came from. If I didn't have to eat or sleep, I'd likely never leave these walls. The librarians and cleaners have even gotten to the point where they'll simply allow me to go into any area I please. I've walked into the staff room and the janitor's closet at least once each. In my defense the rooms weren't properly marked. I apologized in each case and left but they seemed to hold no problem with my explorations.\n\nA week ago though, I found a new door.\n\nIt was technically outside. Near to the car park, there was a small flight of concrete stairs I had not seen before, leading down to a heavy and very old looking door. It was beautiful and very well kept. I wouldn't be surprised if it's a single piece of Ebony given its look and weight. It wasn't locked either. But the hour was late and my stomach demanding, so I left. I've checked on my arrival each day since and the door hasn't been there. The staircase itself was missing every time and to be entirely honest, I had been starting to believe I had dreamed the entire discovery.\n\n​Until today.\n\nAs I left the library just after sunset, there it was. Maybe I'd been checking the wrong place? I couldn't go another week of searching fruitlessly for this damnable place. So I opened the door. The bookcases here are actually fairly modern. High quality, very well maintained. I wouldn't even say any of these books are particularly valuable, or controversial. It seems like any other part of the library, I wonder why it's so secreted away?\n\nI found a railing, looks like some kind of balcony. Goes down several floors. I can see at least five other railings, but after that it gets too dark. Can't see the bookcases on the other floors, but now I have to know what are in them! Haven't seen any staff yet, which is good. There's been some movement, the sound of books being put on a shelf or boots scuffing the floor in the next aisle over. So there are definitely other people down here. I'm just glad they're sensible enough to keep to themselves. The books are slightly ratty and yellowed. Is this the damaged pages section? Don't worry, I'll be careful with them, I'm not some kid.\n\n​Took about an hour but I found a staircase down. Haven't found one up yet so it looks like the way I came in is the only entrance. That's really not a good idea. The bookcases are older down here. They probably haven't gotten around to updating them, the contents are still fairly recent though so that's a thing. Not entirely sure how long I've been down here at this rate, but there are so many books I can't help myself. So much knowledge that's going to waste without someone enjoying it. The weirdest part is that I don't remember actually reading any of these books. Sure, I want to read them, and I'll reach for them to check out the covers. But I put them back, none of them are the right book for right now apparently.\n\nHow many times have I walked these two aisles?\n\nI have to say I'm starting to hate the other people perusing down here. No-one seems to be any good at putting things back where they got them. I keep finding books out of order, or on the wrong shelf or even the wrong bookcase. It's infuriating! At least they're not stealing them, but it's maddening.\n\n​I'm hearing less noise from downstairs, I could head down? Maybe its more organized down there, I can actually concentrate on reading.\n\nWhy are the bookcases here so old? The books aren't even that old, it's just gaudy looking at these new covers sitting on rotting old wooden boards. The bookcases aren't really arranged very well, it's a maze down here. I'm not very far from the staircase back up of course, I could leave if I wanted but at this point I want to know what else I can find.\n\nWhy are the bookcases here so old? The books aren't even that bad, it's like looking at fresh prints sitting on the deck of some ancient pirate ship. Why am I holding this book? I didn't take it from a shelf, did someone around here slip it into my hands? How am I supposed to put it back if I don't know where they took it from?

A bastion of silence and solace amidst the relentless cacophony of the city, it was here, in this realm of boundless knowledge, that our tale unfolds.\n\nOur protagonist, a solitary figure cloaked in the shadows of obscurity, found refuge in the sanctuary of the Reading Room. Unlike the bustling streets where the world moved at a relentless pace, the Reading Room stood still, a testament to the eternal quest for wisdom. The air within its walls was thick with the scent of ancient paper and the soft whispers of those who had traversed its aisles before.\n\nThis was a place where the ordinary became extraordinary, where the mundane was elevated to the sublime. The protagonist, weary from the incessant chatter of the outside world, found solace in the silence of the Reading Room. Here, amidst the towering stacks of ancient tomes, the soul could find peace.\n\nThe Reading Room was a labyrinth, a maze of knowledge, a universe contained within four walls. Each book, a star in the galaxy of human thought, shimmered with the promise of untold wisdom. The protagonist wandered its aisles, a pilgrim in search of enlightenment, lost in the boundless sea of words.\n\nOne fateful day, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the Reading Room's grand entrance, the protagonist discovered a door. It was a portal, hidden in plain sight, leading to a realm within the realm, a sanctuary within the sanctuary.\n\nThe door, ancient and foreboding, beckoned with a mysterious allure. It led to the Inner Sanctum, a place where the oldest and most enigmatic tomes were kept. Here, the air was thicker, the silence more profound. The aisles were narrow, the bookcases towering, and the tomes, ancient and yellowed, seemed to whisper secrets of a bygone era.\n\nThe protagonist ventured deeper, drawn by the allure of the unknown. The Inner Sanctum was a maze, a labyrinth of knowledge, a place where time stood still. The tomes, bound in leather and gold, spoke of epochs long past, of civilizations risen and fallen, of secrets hidden in the depths of the human soul.\n\nAs the hours passed, the protagonist became ensnared in the labyrinth of the Inner Sanctum. The tomes called to them, begged to be read, to be understood. But the more they searched, the more they realized that the true treasure of the Inner Sanctum was not the knowledge contained within its walls, but the silence, the solitude, the peace.\n\nIn the end, the protagonist emerged from the Inner Sanctum, changed by the experience. The outside world seemed different now, more vibrant, more alive. The bustling streets, once a source of noise and chaos, now whispered of untold possibilities.\n\nAnd as the sun rose, casting its golden light upon the Reading Room, the protagonist knew that they had found something more precious than knowledge, something more profound than understanding. They had found peace, solace, and, in the silent halls of the Inner Sanctum, a place where the soul could truly soar.\n\nThe Reading Room stood still, a sanctuary of silence and solace, a bastion of knowledge and wisdom.

I guessed and a few of the guys agreed after it was done, that they must have been reserves from some occupied state, like Poland or Czechoslovakia, sent to die to hold us up while the Germans retreated.\n\nWhat sick bastards just send men to dielike that Mary? Just to save their own skins for a few more days. They knew that Uncle Sam and the US Army were coming for them and they were rightly scared.\n\nAfter about 30 mins our guns fell silent, at last they stopped coming. We restocked and reloaded, waiting nervously for a second attack, it never came. As the sun rose we saw the true extent of what had happened, must have been nearly 100 dead, I couldn't quite believe it. I said a prayer for them, that they may repent before the Lord.\n\nShortly after a voice came over a speaker, in almost perfect English, but with that unmistakable Kraut accent, asking if they may be allowed to retrieve the dead and wounded. We being good Christian folks we gave them that, but warned them any funny business and they'd see a repeat of the previous night.\n\nWhat must have been nearly a platoons worth of what I assume were medics and stretcher bearers appeared from the ruins of the German lines, all wearing their white helmets and red cross smocks. They began gathering the bodies, but not all of them. They were checking each one and only taking certain ones. I watched one of them through my scope pass over a wounded man, reaching out with one hand and holding in his guts with the other and take a body that was very clearly dead.\n\nI couldn't understand, first they'd sent these boys to die in a pointless attack, and now they were leaving them to die in the field, I laid my cross hairs over him andonlyby the Lord's virtue, resited the urge to send that bastard straight to hell.\n\nAfter they took some of the dead, they only left those who had suffered massive injuries, missing limbs and a few of the victims of my own head shots, I'm fact I didn't see them take a single body with a head wound.\n\nThis is where they really made me sick and a few of us had to be restrained and threatened with a court marshal. They came out and killed the wounded.\n\nJust walked out and bayoneted any who were still alive, those that could have been saved. One kid who it looked like he had taken a round or some shrapnel to his leg, a minor thing, he'd have been fine in a week or two. No.\n\nThose fuckers stood over him as he cried out for help, we could all hear their cries, and stabbed him through the heart.\n\nOnly then did they take them away.\n\nI'm sorry my love if this seems too much, but I don't know how I could write what came next without these details, if you get this letter, you need to tell the world what happened, they cant be allowed to get away with this.\n\nAll was quiet for the next 2 days, no contacts, no sound. But our orders stayed the same, we were to stay and hold REDACTED until we were relived and taken off the line.\n\nOn the third night a fog rolled in, we couldn't see much farther than 50 or 60 yards. We occasionally sent up flares, but this did little to helpbut reminded the Germans we were very much still here\n\nI'd drawn night watch again and so I lay in my hide, waiting. Dougherty had just brought some some coffee to help me stay awake, I couldn't do much, what use is a sniper who cant see and further than the next G.I.?\n\nAll of a sudden there were shouts down the line of movement. I figured it was just someone getting skittish, it was so quiet, anything seemed like something and most of the time something was nothing.\n\nI rolled back over and looked down my sight and I that's when I saw them. You have to believe me on this, Mary. I swear this wasn't a trick of the light, or being tired, I saw this, and I'm sure the other guys would say they did too if they still could.\n\nTheir eyes Mary, this figure started to emerge from the fog, and the eyes, were glowing, 2 yellow spots piercing the gloom. As they got closer, it looked like one of the conscripted Krauts from a few nights back, same uniform. I figured they has a few more platoons to have use waste ammo on. But this time, there was no screaming, no running.They just shambledsilently through the fog. Theydidn't respond to ID's and soone of the guysput a round through its chest.\n\nNothing, it didn't react, didn't go down, didn't make a sound, and kept walking. A few more shots rang out until the ping of his clip ejecting echoed through the night, I watched them, every one hit, centre mass. It kept walking, a few seconds later a round went through its skull and it dropped, the eyes faded away as it fell.\n\nNo one knew what to think, but I could hear them jostling the poor guy saying he must have missed. One of the other guys boasting he knew how to drop Krauts. He didn't miss Mary, I swear on my mom's grave, I watched them hit its chest,and it didn't drop, just carried on asif being hit with rocks.\n\nThe jostling didn'tlast long, a few shout's said more movement. Ashout came for aflareto go up togive us a better look,I almost wish they hadn't. I saw them before the others, dozens of them, their eyes shining through the fog.We opened fireand these things couldn't have cared less. They marched through the fire, their bodies being tornupby multiplehitsand they kept coming.\n\nThe odd lucky round hit a head and a body dropped, butno oneseemed to notice. Panic was setting in now, the first one hit our line, dropped over the barricade. I heard the screams over gunfire, soul wrenching shrieks from the guys below.\n\nI know I should have done more, but it didn't seem real Mary. I looked though my scope and tried for headshots where I could,I must have dropped a few. But It wasn't enough, they kept coming.\n\nThat's whenI saw him Mary, the young soldier from the first attack, I'm sure it was him, I could see the wound on his leg, and the hole in his chest and his face, despite the eyes, he looked just as scared. I put him to rest, at least I did that.\n\nWe had to scramble to pull back from REDACTED, I'm not sure how many of us made it, but we lost more than a few good men last night. We managed to get out, and pull back to REDACTED. But they were coming we could hear them now, dozens of them just groaning in the night.\n\nNow Mary, this isn't going to be easy, but I think this may be the last letter I can send for a while, the10th have been ordered to stay and hold the ground at REDACTED, give the rest of the rear units time to pull back, set up a new line. Ive managed to scribble this down while they load up the trucks and I've given this letter to a Chaplin from the 57th and he's sworn to me he'll get it to you and I pray to god that he has.\n\nKnow that I love you, and I pray for the day I can come back home to you. I know the lord will give me strength to carry out his work and that I'm in your thoughts and prayers as you are in mine.\n\nAll my Love\n\nYour Edward.\n\n*Letter seized by Office of Censorship- Passed to OSS for further investigation*\n\n** Contents verified by multiple sources- evidence of German Rift Tech.**\n\n***The 10th Infantry Company, 3rd Battalion was wiped outby enemy action on the night of 3rd August 1944-Official reports will indicate fierce bombardment followed by an assault by enemy infantry of a known and poorly defended position- sub-par officer leadership and troop discipline will be blamed as primary factor.

Grayson**\n\n**Subject: Anomalous Incident Report - The Village of Schwarzkreuz**\n\n*This report contains sensitive and classified material. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. Unauthorized disclosure will result in severe penalties.*\n\n---\n\nDear Logbook,\n\nThe shadows that fall at dusk in the village of Schwarzkreuz are long and ominous, stretching like bony fingers over the rubble of war. I pen this account with a quivering hand, not from the cold of the approaching night, but from the chill that grips my soul, a sense of unease that has grown with each passing day since we arrived.\n\nOur mission was straightforward — to establish a forward operating base in this remote hamlet, a stepping stone for the larger operations to come. Yet, from the moment we breached the village's boundary, an air of dread pervaded our ranks. The silence was eerie, the ruins of homes and shops standing as silent sentinels to a horror that had yet to unfold.\n\nThe first night brought no respite. Whispers stirred in the wind, and shapes moved in the periphery of our vision, vanishing when we turned to confront them. We dismissed it as nerves, the psychological toll of war. But as dawn broke, we found our perimeter breached, evidence of a nightly ritual that had been unfolding here for years.\n\nSkeletal remains, dressed in tattered uniforms, greeted us. Not the uniform of any known enemy, but something older, more macabre. The village was a graveyard, not of soldiers but of something far more grotesque. We stumbled upon a hidden crypt beneath an old church, its walls lined with these figures, their eyes sunken and lifeless. Yet, there was a strange vitality about them, a presence that clung to the air like a sinister mist.\n\nCommand ordered a thorough investigation, but the village held its secrets close. Our attempts to excavate the crypt were met with an otherworldly resistance, as if the earth itself was alive, rejecting our intrusion. We encountered disturbances in the night, spectral whispers, and shadows that danced along the edges of our campfires.\n\nOne night, as I stood watch, I witnessed an eerie procession. Figures, indistinguishable from those in the crypt, moved through the village, their movements mechanical and precise. They carried with them what appeared to be the bodies of our fallen comrades, their expressions frozen in terror. I fired, aiming to protect what remained of our squad, but the bullets passed through them as if they were mere specters.\n\nThe following days were a blur of fear and confusion. We spoke in hushed tones, our nights punctuated by the haunting sounds of the dead. We tried to maintain a semblance of order, but the village seemed to consume us from within, its history of horror etching itself into our very souls.\n\nOur report, sealed with this log, includes footage and photographs that capture the essence of what we encountered. The Department of Anomalous Warfare has been briefed, and we await further instructions.\n\nI fear that Schwarzkreuz is but one chapter in a larger narrative, a tale of horrors that have been unleashed upon this world. We are but pawns in a game we do not understand, caught between the living and the dead, the known and the unknown.\n\nWith this letter, I entrust the truth to those who can bear to hear it. May this account serve as a warning, a beacon in the darkness, guiding those who dare to look beyond the veil of normalcy.\n\n**End of Transmission**\n\n---\n\n*This document has been submitted for review and classification under the War Security Act of 1941.

{"id": "text_completion_043", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"1130\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Ah, look at that. It's a cardboard box, sitting on a hill. A lonely hill, at first glance. The cardboard box was a cardboard color, that off-brown. It was a common color, more common than bark here. But there was only one for a good distance around, so I guess we'll have to settle with this one. Come on. Let's get a closer look!\n\n\nThis box was upside down, so when the smarter critters of this world looked down from their cardboard planes they'd see a cross in its little flaps. Not that the box couldn't be opened on both ends, it's just that the skywards side was taped up and impenetrable.\n\nThe box was meant to be carried this direction, though. Whoever had opened it had opened it up from the wrong side. You could tell because this box had two little oval-shaped dotted lines, which could be popped on out to lift the thing. One was still in. The other had disappeared, having turned into the only part of the box for folk like us. Observers, who couldn't do much with cardboard but peak in. The inside of the box was mostly hidden in shadow, like a nest of black fur. Maybe this box was empty! But it most likely wasn't, the box-critter is probably sleeping. Here, let's try to wake it up. A bit of wind would probably do the trick.\n\nwoooooooooooshhhhhhhhhhh…\n\nGood job, good job, that's— that's a good wind. A constant breeze, which causes the grass about the hill to flow up and down in hollow V-shapes alongside those who traverse in boats on the opposite side of the dirt. The grass was once again alive, and trading gossip as much as grass ever does. Petty little plants.\n\nOur box was not ready for the wind. It was pushed up into the air just a few inches, before eight-odd triangles covered in static-filled hairs erupted out of the box and clicked into place about the dirt and stone. That little handle-hole, the one which had been popped out by someone some time back, gained two round golden eyes, like lost fireflies who'd soared a bit too high in that night sky. The box-critter spun in a circle, looking about for whoever had spawned this wind. But after not seeing much of anything, it settled on making an annoyed Tik tik! sound, and started off on its way down the hill. Come on, let's follow it. Maybe it'll lead us to something interesting.\n\nYou know, I'm surprised this one is alone. They normally travel in groups! Hm? Oh, yeah, I'm sure the groups have an actual name, I just don't know what it is. The box-critter doesn't seem to know quite where it is going. It makes its way down one hill just to go up another. It seems to have a solid goal though, spinning about at the top of every hill before choosing which one it'll go to next. It always seems to choose the tallest one, maybe searching for a good view, or something more useful. Do you think it's lost? Is that why it isn't with a group? How sad.\n\nA sound was added to the music of the landscape. Up until now, the noise was basically just background, not really making for an important Observation. It was just acting out its part in the world because it had to, because it was always there, and because it was nice. The breeze made for a good chorus and the grass added some interesting verses. But it was all disrupted by the sad growling of the box-critters hidden stomach. Tik tik. The box-critter kept wandering. It kept looking for food. The firefly lights in its box's handle-peephole grew dim. I… don't like Observing this. But we've already chosen it as our Narrated, and I don't see any other cardboard critters around to switch it with…\n\nHere's the thing about grass. As I've mentioned, they're petty creatures, but they're also important ones. Grass divides one place from another. Crossing grass has to happen no matter who you are or where you're going. And grass can be very helpful, when they're kind enough to use their role as Bridge to Everywhere to accomplish great things…\n\nAnd, well, I'd really like to think grass is forgiving, whether or not that's the case is up to you.\n\nThe grass didn't react. Then one, tiny strand, one that had just sprouted and couldn't even be really seen by anyone but ants and the smallest of Observers, decided it wanted to be what I'd just Narrated. It decided it wanted to try, even if it didn't really like Observers as a concept. After all, what was the point of being an Observer? Wasn't the world built to be interacted with? Wasn't it a blade of grass so that it could talk with and traverse the dirt? The child blade sunk into the dirt, inverting its small piece of the hill quilt. And the rest of the grass decided to join it, in a rare domino effect. The box-critter fell into a sinkhole, and popped up on the other side of the grass, where a muddy-green sea expanded in all directions. The box-critter was sitting in its cardboard shell as though it were a boat, which meant it was very much exposed for the time being. Box-critters are simple beings. Just black fur, legs, and eyes. It clutched the frontmost wall of its boat-box and watched the waves pass by. It was either confused by how it had gotten here or happy with the view, it's up to you.\n\nHere, let's blow the water, we can push the box-critter along. Create a V-shape in the water. Maybe someone traversing the hills will see it in the grass, and imagine up a story for the specific adventure that we're causing. Who knows! The water passes by. The colors change, from green-brown to a perfect clear, with the roots of the grass rise upwards like seaweed in the water. Actually, some of the grass looks sick. Mushrooms, some fungus or another, was growing along their roots, trying to kill them off where they can't defend themselves. The fungus is of an edible breed, let's help out our box-critter while also aiding the grass that got us here.\n\nWe blew the fungus off the grass, so it floated atop the water, off-white islands just within reach of the box-critters' pyramidal legs. It made for a solid meal, though the consistency of soggy mushrooms got dull after a bit I'm sure. The box-critter was creative though, bending the mushrooms in different shapes over the side of its cardboard boat and leaving them out to dry for a bit. Tik tik, it said.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

A number, 1130, was carved on a stone pillar that stood atop a hill, its letters chiseled deep by the hands of forgotten artisans. This number, a silent sentinel, guarded the secrets of the ages, whispering tales of bygone eras to those who dared to listen.\n\nBelow the hill, amongst the tangled roots of ancient trees and the quiet murmurs of a forgotten river, lived a community of beings unlike any other. These were the Keepers of Time, ethereal beings who had been charged with the task of preserving the memories of the world. They existed in a realm between dream and reality, their forms shifting with the breeze, their voices the soft echoes of the past.\n\nOne day, as the sun hung low in the sky, casting golden hues across the landscape, a Keeper stumbled upon the stone pillar bearing the enigmatic number 1130. Fascinated by its presence, the Keeper decided to unravel the mystery surrounding this peculiar marker. With a gentle touch, the Keeper summoned the winds of curiosity, causing the leaves of the surrounding trees to rustle with whispers of ancient knowledge.\n\nThe number 1130 was a code, a secret gateway to a realm within the realm. It was said that this hidden place held the essence of the world's first creations, the seeds from which all life sprang. To find it, one had to traverse through the layers of time, guided by the whispers of the past.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, the Keeper began the journey, following the path illuminated by the coded number. The path was treacherous, fraught with illusions and trials that tested the very essence of one's being. But the Keeper's resolve never wavered, driven by the burning desire to uncover the secrets of the 1130.\n\nAs the Keeper journeyed deeper into the heart of time, the world around them shifted, revealing hidden vistas and forgotten memories. They traversed through forests where the trees spoke in hushed tones, across rivers that whispered the secrets of the earth, and over mountains that stood as silent sentinels of the past.\n\nFinally, after a journey that seemed to span eternity, the Keeper reached the heart of the 1130. There, in a cave shrouded in mist, lay a ancient repository of knowledge, guarded by the spirits of the first creations. The Keeper delved into the repository, absorbing the wisdom of the ancients, learning the secrets of the world's first creations and the energies that fueled the fabric of reality.\n\nWith this knowledge in their heart, the Keeper returned to the world, their form now shimmering with the essence of time itself. They shared the teachings of the 1130 with their community, igniting a renaissance of understanding and connection to the world around them.\n\nThe number 1130, once a mystery, became a symbol of the endless pursuit of knowledge and the profound beauty of the world's origins. It stood as a reminder that the answers we seek are often hidden in the depths of time, waiting to be uncovered by those brave enough to journey into the unknown.\n\nAnd so, the story of the Keeper and the number 1130 became a legend, passed down through generations, inspiring countless souls to embark on their own quests for knowledge and understanding.

{"id": "text_completion_044", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"romance\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Once upon a time, there was a young man, headstrong and clear about his desires in life. Despite his youth, he possessed a unique sense of purpose. He had recently moved into a small neighborhood nestled in the forest just outside of town, eager to start a new chapter of his life. One day, while out on a walk, he encountered two beautiful young girls who had recently moved into the neighborhood, each living on opposite sides of the neighborhood. Despite their contrasting natures, they got along remarkably well. The first girl was incredibly smart. She wore glasses and had a stunning head of golden curls. She loved to weave stories for her friends, tales of fantastic beasts, heroic adventures, and the mysteries of space and stars. Her gentle nature reflected her love for all living things. She dreamed of going to college and becoming someone who made a difference. Her dreams were as brilliant as her spirit and very achievable. Her name was Yellow.\n\nThe second girl was a blend of fierceness and peace. She exuded a calm and serene demeanor but could become piercingly unpredictable when needed. Never mean, she had a somber side when necessary and a fierce determination when required. Unlike Yellow, she was not as ambitious. She cherished life as it was, content and complacent, wanting to see where it would naturally lead her. Her name was Blue. Both just as beautiful.\n\nThat day, they decided to be friends. They spent a lot of time together—sometimes all three of them, and other times one on one. As the years went by, they became best friends, almost inseparable. Despite their friendship, the young man found himself falling in love with both of them, but he never confessed his feelings.\n\nThey explored the woods together, venturing as far as they could and sharing countless stories. Always led by Yellow's ambition and curious nature. The more time they spent together, the deeper the young man's love grew. Then, without warning, Yellow left. She disappeared without telling anyone, breaking the young man's heart. He had loved her deeply but never told her. He searched everywhere and asked everyone, but no one knew where she had gone, or even seemed to remember her.\n\nDevastated, he and Blue mourned the loss of their friend and tried to move on. With Yellow gone, the young man's time and attention were now focused solely on Blue.\n\nThe two of them grew up together, transitioning into adulthood. Blue remained as content and serene as ever. As more years passed, the young man's love for Blue deepened, though a part of his heart still belonged to Yellow. He never truly moved on from her departure, but Blue was always there to support him, sharing in his sorrow. After all, she had been friends with Yellow too.\n\nOne morning the young man heard a knock on the door. To his surprise when he opened the door, it was Yellow. He began to weep. After so many years his search was finally over. He finally found his long lost love. All his feelings came back to him like a rush of water. He embraced her tightly and they both fell to their knees. She started to cry as well. The only words to come out of her mouth was \"im sorry\". After they collected themselves they called Blue over and celebrated her return. They asked her many times what had happened. To this day they never got a real answer.\n\nNaturally, she was reintegrated back into their lives. They became a trio again. Once again they were spending time together like before, but this time as adults. They had cars and money and real places beyond the forest to explore. So the group once again was led by Yellow's ambition to adventure. They went off to new places, the three of them. Saw new things and met new people and ate new foods. The young man fell in love with her all over again. He was back to a heart divided. After all this time he still never told either of them how he felt.\n\nHowever, the fun couldn't last forever. As Yellow's ambition to achieve her dreams grew, she wanted to do more. Blue remained content and wanted to enjoy life as it was. The young man found himself at a crossroads, torn between his love for Yellow and his love for Blue. He knew this day would come, a day when a decision had to be made. So after a month of pondering he decided he wanted to follow his own path.\n\nHe decided to get as far away from them both as possible. Not out of resentment or disdain, but because it hurt him too much to pick. If he chose one, he would never really be happy. The thought of leaving either of them behind tore at his heart though, creating an unbearable pain that seemed to suffocate him. Each time he thought about it, it felt like a wound reopening, yet he knew it was the only way to find solace. His love for both of them was so profound that to favor one would betray the other, and in that betrayal, he would lose a part of himself. The ache of his divided heart was a constant reminder of what he was giving up.\n\nThe day came when Yellow announced she had enrolled in the college of her dreams. It was time for her to leave once more, just when it seemed they had only just gotten her back. That same day, the young man decided to speak up and tell them he was leaving too, in a different direction, far from home and even farther from them. At that moment, he broke down, unable to bear it any longer. After 15 years, he finally confessed his feelings, speaking with such passion, affection, and love that each word was like a symphony to their ears. When he finished, he sat down and just cried. The silence between them was deafening.\n\nThey both stared at him. Teary eyed and dazed. Not much was said after that. The night came soon and they all just wanted to go home. After a few exchanged words, they said their goodnights and farewells, each going their separate ways. A trio a lifetime in the making, broken in an hour. The young man left a few days later, his heart shattering completely when neither Blue nor Yellow came to see him off or say goodbye. For months, they didn't speak—not one letter, just complete silence. It burned him deeply. Every second was filled with tears, every minute felt like an eternity, and every day was a struggle. All he could think about was them.\n\nHe tried so hard to forget about them. He did everything he could. But everything reminded him of them. Every tree, every creek, every story he heard. It all just reminded him of them. Years go by and he traveled the world. Never staying in one place. How could he? He knew there had to be a place farther from them. A place that's beyond even memories. He grew older and older. He never found the perfect place nor did he ever move on. His love was so strong it never wore away even after his body did. After so many years he couldnt travel anymore. So he decided to settle down where it all began.\n\nHe went home. The only place he ever really called home. When he got there all that was left was one house amidst a dense forest. Well maintained and lived in. He walked up to the door and on it hung a sign that read \"I kept it warm for you. -Blue\" He opened the door but no one was there. He looked around to find anyone but he was all alone. He found old pictures of the three of them hung on the wall with notes on each one. They all read different things like memories of those days or comments about the picture. He sat on his old couch and on the table was a note. He picked it up with trembling hands and he began to read\n\nDear Logan,\n\nYou finally made it home after so many years. I wish I could be there to see you. I wish I could have said goodbye all those years ago, and I'm sorry I didn't. I was scared that if I saw you, I would have gone with you. But my place was always here. Yellow left shortly after you did. She missed you, but only as a friend. That's all she ever wanted. She was in love with her dreams and ambitions, always seeing only what she wanted and going after it. She really made it seem like there was a choice, didn't she? Like your love was warranted. We both saw it. When you confessed, it wasn't a shock—we just didn't know what to say. We both knew how you felt. Why she led you on is beyond me. She knew you loved her but made it seem like you had a chance. Like you could choose. But even if you had chosen her, she would have left anyway. To her, you were a friend, and that's all it ever was.\n\nBut for me, I knew you loved me, and I wish you had said something sooner. I loved you too, but I never spoke up. It's partially my fault. I was too content with things as they were to start something new. We were meant to be, but fate had other plans, I guess. I waited for you, but you never came back. The only reason you left was because she made you feel like you had to choose. In our eyes, there was really only one option. I wish we had said something sooner.\n\nMaybe in another life, we could have made it work. Until then, know that you were always loved. See you when you get here. Love, Blue\n\nAs He read the note, tears welled up in his eyes, and he felt a profound sense of sorrow mixed with a strange relief. Blue's words echoed in the quiet house, filling the empty spaces with the love and regrets of a lifetime. He sat on the old couch, memories flooding back, each one more vivid than the last. As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow through the windows, Logan felt a sense of peace he hadn't felt in years. He knew that his journey had come full circle.\n\nHe stood up and walked outside, feeling the cool evening breeze on his face. He wandered through the familiar paths of the forest, each step bringing back a memory of his youth. He realized that Blue had been right—this place was his true home, the only place where he felt truly at peace.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Logan slowly began to rebuild his life in the place where it all started. He tended to the house and the garden, finding solace in the simple routines. He wrote letters to Blue, though he had no address to send them to, pouring out his thoughts and feelings, hoping that somehow, she would know.\n\nAs the seasons changed, Logan's health began to decline. He knew his time was coming to an end, but he felt ready. He had found his peace, and he was surrounded by the memories of those he loved. One crisp autumn evening, he sat on the porch, wrapped in a warm blanket, watching the sun set over the forest. The sky was painted with hues of orange and pink, a final gift from the sky as if it was welcoming him.\n\nAs the stars began to appear, Logan closed his eyes and let out a contented sigh. He felt the presence of Yellow and Blue, their love enveloping him like a comforting embrace. With a heart full of love and memories, Logan drifted into a peaceful sleep, never to awaken. The last thing he heard as his spirit left his body was the faint sound of Blue and Yellow's voice. \"Ready for the next adventure?\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In the heart of a verdant valley, cradled by the caress of whispering leaves and the soft laments of a distant brook, there lived a young man whose spirit was as untamed as the wind. His dreams, vast and boundless, yearned for the touch of the stars, and he chased them with a vigor that painted the dawn with his unyielding determination.\n\nThis young man, named Ethan, had recently transplanted his life from the bustling cacophony of the city to a secluded hamlet nestled within the embrace of the woods. The air here was different, laden with the scent of pine and the quiet whispers of the earth. It was here, in this sanctuary of serenity, that Ethan sought to forge a new chapter, one filled with purpose and a profound connection to the life that thrived around him.\n\nOne golden afternoon, as the sun dipped its golden fingers into the canvas of the sky, painting it with shades of amber and rose, Ethan stumbled upon two ethereal presences within the heart of the woods. They were two young women, each as unique and captivating as the dawn's first light. One, with hair as dark as the raven's wing and eyes that mirrored the deepest ocean, was named靛蓝 (Blue). The other, with curls that danced in the sunlight like golden flames and a spirit as boundless as the universe, was named黄 (Yellow).\n\nDespite their contrasting natures, Blue and Yellow were as close as the threads of a woven tapestry. Blue, with her calm and serene demeanor, found solace in the simplicity of life, content to let the river of time carry her where it willed. Yellow, on the other hand, was a vessel of ambition and dreams, her mind a labyrinth of stories yet untold and adventures yet undertaken.\n\nEthan was drawn to them, not by chance, but by the unyielding force of fate. He found himself ensnared in their world, a place where laughter was as common as the morning dew and dreams were as vast as the horizon. As seasons turned and leaves fell and bloomed again, Ethan's heart wove itself into the fabric of their friendship, a thread that neither time nor distance could sever.\n\nIn the quiet moments, under the watchful eyes of the stars, Ethan's heart confessed its deepest secrets to the night, yearning for the touch of Blue's serene gaze or the sparkle in Yellow's determined eyes. Yet, his love remained untold, a secret kept close to his chest, afraid that its revelation might shatter the delicate balance of their world.\n\nThen, without warning, Yellow vanished, leaving behind a void that threatened to devour the light from Ethan's world. She left no trace, no reason, no memory but her own. Ethan's heart, torn and bleeding, found solace in Blue's unwavering陪伴 (company), as together they mourned the loss of their friend and tried to weave the tattered threads of their lives back together.\n\nYears passed, and Ethan's love for Blue deepened, yet a part of his heart remained anchored to Yellow's memory. Blue, ever the steadfast companion, supported him through the storms of his sorrow, her calm presence a balm to his aching soul.\n\nOne fateful morning, as the first light of dawn kissed the earth, a knock at Ethan's door heralded the return of Yellow. The reunion was a symphony of tears and unspoken words, a maelstrom of joy and pain. Blue, ever the peacemaker, welcomed Yellow back into their fold, and the trio, once more united, embarked on adventures that spanned the breadth of their dreams.\n\nAs Yellow's ambitions soared, the divide between Ethan's love for her and Blue grew. The weight of his divided heart became too great, and he chose to travel far from the only home he had ever known, seeking solace in the vastness of the unknown.\n\nYears passed, and Ethan's travels took him across seas and continents, yet no distance could quench the thirst of his longing. He found no solace, for the memory of Blue and Yellow haunted every corner of his journey. The world was too small, too filled with echoes of their laughter and the shadows of their dreams.\n\nFinally, weary and old, Ethan returned to the hamlet that had cradled his youth. The house, well-maintained and warm, greeted him with open arms. Notes from Blue, tender and filled with regret, revealed the depth of her love and the pain of their separation. In the quiet moments, Ethan felt their presence, a comforting embrace that eased the ache of his divided heart.\n\nAs the seasons turned once more, Ethan found peace in the routines of life, writing letters to Blue that would never reach her, pouring out his thoughts and dreams. In the embrace of the forest, he found his final solace, surrounded by the memories of loves lost and the promise of eternity.\n\nAnd as the sun set on the horizon, painting the sky with the colors of dusk, Ethan closed his eyes and let himself be carried by the winds of fate, his spirit rejoining the loves of his life in a place where the stars hang low and dreams are born anew.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the distinct writing voice and intricate stylistic nuances of the preceding text very well.

And while you've known them for such a short time, you feel like you have loved them for a lifetime.\" - Courtney Peppernell*\n\nI was privileged to live a normal life. Work a normal job. Earn an average salary. Go home to an ordinary house. But for me it was too normal. I wanted to be something else. Someone I would look up to. Someone I could admire. But I was just too normal and I hated it.\n\nAfter a long and typical day at work, I would usually go to the bar with some friends from work. There's this somewhat secret bar that we often go to because not a lot of people would be there, and basically get the place all to ourselves. Today was a bit different. I went there alone because my friends all have relationships they had to juggle. I was a bit jealous but I didn't really mind. I was barely making enough for my own, how could I get into a relationship when I'm not stable enough. As I got into the bar, it was, as expected, empty except for a woman in the bar where I would usually sit. I approached the table and sat down beside her.\n\n\"Whiskey, on the rocks.\", I ordered my usual drink from the bartender. He nodded and proceeded to make the drink for me.\n\nI was curious as to what the woman looked like so I took a quick glance but at the same time I looked at her, I met her eyes. She was beautiful. She was pale but had a pinkish blush on her cheeks. Her eyes were big and housed beautiful brown iris. Her lips were full, painted with a pinkish tint. She was what I would call ‘my ideal type'. I looked away and got saved by my drink arriving in front of me.\n\n\"Thanks.\", I blurted out as I got so nervous sitting beside her.\n\n\"So what do you think?\", she asked. I got even more nervous and was honestly quite surprised to be asked a question.\n\n\"Me?\", I asked as I tried to confirm if she was really talking to me.\n\n\"Who else?\", She continued to look at me as she sipped her Margarita. \"So? Am I pretty or not?\"\n\n\"Wha- Why would you ask me that?\", I nervously tried to avoid her question but it didn't really work.\n\n\"Well, you were curious enough to see how I looked that you tried your best to glance. I just wanted to know if I passed your expectations.\", she continued.\n\nShe was very brazen and really didn't have a hint of shame as she continued to ask me the question. But I honestly found that quite intriguing.\n\nI shyly laughed and took a sip from my drink. \"Yeah.\", I said as I took a sip.\n\nShe chuckled. \"Well good\". She chugged her drink and got up. \"Let's go\", she said as she enthusiastically looked at me.\n\nI was taken aback as I didn't really know what she meant. \"What? I haven't even finished my drink yet.\", I tried talking my way out of it as I just wanted to finish my drink.\n\nShe took out her wallet and paid for my drink. \"Here, a treat for my friend.\", she handed the bill to the waiter and proceeded to grab my hand and dragged me out of the bar.\n\n\"Wait! Wait!\", I took one final sip from my delicious whiskey.\n\nI was bummed out that I got disturbed from my alone time. I wasn't really expecting to be walking alone with a woman just by simply glancing at her. As I said, I wasn't in the right situation to really get into a relationship so I just continued to close my doors.\n\n\"I know a nice *tteokbokki* place around here.\" She looked really pretty though. Earlier in the bar, she was looking down before we started talking, but now she looks like a completely different person. She looks even more pretty now that she's smiling.\n\n\"Wait, I don't even know you, yet I'm getting dragged into a date.\"\n\n\"A date?\", she laughed at my nonsense. \"Well if you think this is a date, then I should really tell you my name then.\" She hopped in front of me and stared into my eyes. She reached out a hand. \"Valorie\".\n\nEven her name sounds pretty. I instinctively grabbed her hand and shook it. \"Luke\".\n\nShe smiled and proceeded to walk in front of me. \"Come on, it's just around the corner.\" I don't know whats with her, but she's oddly persuasive and captivating. I thought to myself that I was thankful that I wasn't this gullible when I was a kid.\n\nAs we entered the *tteokbokki* shop, she was immediately greeted by the owner. \"V! You're back! The usual?\", the owner exclaimed. They seem to have a good relationship as the owner already knew what she wanted.\n\n\"Yes please! And make it double serving please.\", She sat down on the window side and gestured to me to sit down.\n\n\"I didn't know that there was a place like this here.\" For the longest time I lived in Seoul, it was the first time I've seen this snackbar. It looked old but I was sure it carried a lot of memories as well.\n\n\"I come here all the time. Their *tteokbokki* and *odeng* are the real deal.\" She looked happy and it was contagious.\n\n\"You look like a kid.\", I joked and chuckled.\n\nShe frowned at me but her face changed once again when the *tteokbokk*i arrived.\n\n\"Thank you!\", she smiled and merrily dug her chopsticks into the steaming dish. \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" she asked with a mouthful of tteok.\n\nI smiled and proceeded to eat with her. We continued talking and just like that, we both felt close to one another. We shared our stories. She had a completely different style from mine but I found that very attractive. She was the opposite of my normal and boring life and for the first time in my life, I was able to live a not so normal day. It was a feeling that I guess I would never forget.\n\nAs time passed, it became midnight.\n\n\"Well, I think I gotta go. Same time tomorrow, okay?\" She instructed me.\n\n\"What? We're meeting again tomorrow?\" I asked because I was honestly shocked that she still wanted to meet me.\n\n\"Yeah. Why? Are you sick of me already?\" Her face turned from happy to sad and it showed that she might have been going through something.\n\n\"No! I didn't mean that, it's just I didn't know that you'd still like to see me.\", I explained.\n\nHer face lit up. \"Well, if I didn't want to see you again, I would have just said my goodbye, wouldn't I?\" She said with a light grin. \"See you tomorrow!\", she turned around and we proceeded to separate.\n\nThe next day, after work, I was excited to leave. It was the first time in my life that I was looking forward to something after work. What I felt the other day was bliss and I wanted more of that. When work ended, I immediately went to the bar. But to my surprise she wasn't there. I checked the time, and it was exactly the time when I met her. I approached the bartender.\n\n\"The girl, from yesterday, has she–\", I was cut short by a light tap on my shoulder.\n\n\"Looking for me?\", she chuckled. \"Sorry I was late, something came up.\" she explained. She was covered in sweat and she was extra pale today.\n\n\"I-I wasn't looking for you, I was just–\". She placed her finger on my lips and shushed me.\n\n\"Shhh. Stop talking and just come with me.\", she grabbed me by the hand and rushed outside the bar. We took a long walk towards the bus station.\n\n\"Where are we going this time?\" I asked, but she was completely different from yesterday. She wasn't as cheerful and she was just still.\n\n\"Just follow me for a bit.\", a wry smile formed on her lips and it seemed a bit forced. I knew that something was up from that moment. I didn't want to pry but I was getting a little bit worried based on her expressions.\n\n\"Come on, the bus is here.\"\n\nWe boarded the bus and traveled 2 hours to get to Hanagae beach. It was beautiful and we arrived just in time for the sunset. It was quiet on the beach, there was no one there except for us. We walked by the beach side, and admired the sunset. She stood there basked in the orange glow of the setting sun, and she was beautiful.\n\n\"I'm sick.\" she blurted out.\n\n\"Do you have a cold? I could get you some meds–\", I offered. She looked at me and chuckled.\n\n\"Not that kind of sick.\", she looked back at the sun and everything was still. \"I am positive with HIV\"\n\nI was taken back. I didn't know what to say. She looked at me and tears started to flow from her eyes. She fell on the sand and I immediately caught her.\n\n\"I want to live.\" She cried. I couldn't help myself but cry with her. It was news I never expected to hear from someone like her. I comforted her to the best of my ability but I couldn't hide the fact that I was crying with her.\n\n\"Thank you for crying for me.\" she said with a sad smile as she wiped the tears off my cheek. \"Want to hear my story?\".\n\nI nodded and we proceeded to sit on the sand as twilight swallowed the sky. She told me the story of how she got the illness. She told me how her stepfather would sexually harass her, how she would get beaten up if she resisted. She told me how her mother didn't really care about her as she was blinded by her love for her stepfather. She refused to believe the fact that her daughter was getting abused by that sick and worthless stepfather. I was enraged. Words could not express how furious I was to the people who did this to her. I was shaking from anger that it hurt just thinking about it. How could people do this to her? How could something like this happen to someone? I thought these things only happen in movies or in dramas. I never expected it to happen to someone who I grew attached to. It hurts and I knew she was hurting even more.\n\nShe stood up and reached out her hand. Despite her circumstances she still held on and was strong. I admired her and my affections toward her grew even more. I wanted to set things right for her. I wanted her to taste happiness by justice from the people who did this to her. But I knew there was nothing left for me to do as both her stepfather and mother already passed because of the same illness. That was the reason why she was able to spend her remaining days in bliss.\n\n\"Is there anything I could do for you? Anything please.\", my emotions kept spilling out. Was there anything else I could do for her?\n\n\"Same time tomorrow, okay?\" she instructed with a smile. Her smile was beautiful and she shined so bright.\n\nI wiped the tears off my face and she embraced me. I couldn't say anything. My mind was in a haze. I never thought I could get attached to someone like this so quickly. It was a mere 2 days but she was able to make me feel so many emotions. I couldn't lose her.\n\n\"What? Are you sick of me already?\", she jokingly smiled at me. She was doing her best to stay strong, and she was doing well. \"Thank you for being here with me.\"\n\nThe next day, I couldn't keep myself still during work. I wanted to leave already and the last 5 minutes before work ends felt like 5 hours. When the clock struck 4 pm, I immediately left. I rushed to the bar, and there she was sipping her Margarita, waiting for me.\n\n\"What took you so long?\", she frowned. She looked so cute though and she wore such a girly outfit. Her face was still pale but she was stunning. This time, I was the one who grabbed her hand and dragged her out of the bar. I took her to a theme park and I wanted to make her experience things she couldn't before. We enjoyed riding the roller coaster. Going through the haunted mansion. Shoot and throw balls for stuffed toys. We ate popcorn and cotton candy. I then brought her to my favorite restaurant and stuffed ourselves with cheese and pasta. And at the end of the day we dropped by her favorite *tteokbokk*i place and shared even more stories.\n\n\"Thank you.\", she blurted out of the blue. She was looking at me dearly and it gave me butterflies.\n\n\"You know I got you.\", I boasted. My heart was pounding and she could tell.\n\n\"Come on, let's get going. I wanna walk by Han\", she stood up and we left the shop.\n\nWhile walking by the river, she hugged me from behind. My heart fluttered. It felt nice and I wish it wouldn't stop.\n\n\"I never knew I would like someone this fast.\", she continued to hug me then she walked ahead of me.\n\n\"Me too.\", I said softly, but I guess she heard because she looked at me and smiled. She gestured for me to walk with her and we continued to walk by the Han river.\n\nShe started getting tired so I suggested to walk her home.\n\n\"It's getting cold, let's get you home.\" I donned my coat jacket over her and we proceeded home.\n\n\"Luke.\", she called me. \"You made me feel loved today. I got to do things I never did before.\"\n\nI embraced her as her eyes became teary. \"I'll move the world for you, V.\" Then I kissed her. Her kiss was bliss and her embrace was warm. It felt like I was okay with the world ending as long as V was with me, but I knew that was impossible. I didn't want to remember the fact that she was living her final days with me. I wasn't prepared for her to leave me even if I knew.\n\n\"Same time tomorrow?\" I told her. I wanted to spend every day with her. She nodded.\n\nThe next day, work never seemed to end fast. Before work ended, I already texted her that I would be getting off in a few minutes. She replied saying that she was just in the bar and told me to hurry. Just as I was about to leave work, my manager called for me. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. I was already itching to leave but my manager decided to ask for my help for something he should already know as manager. It took around 30 minutes and I zoomed out of the office. I called her multiple times but she was not answering. I thought that she was sulking because I was late. I went by the bar but the bartender said she already left and she also left her phone there. I rushed to the *tteokbokki* shop, but still, she wasn't there. At this point, I started getting worried. I looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be found. And then finally, there she was sitting by Han river. Her pale pretty face staring blankly at the river. Her hair was blown by the wind exposing her neck. She was thinning. She was beautiful.\n\n\"V!\" I called.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled. \"You're here.\", she stood up but immediately collapsed on the ground.\n\nI rushed towards her and people started to flock. Her lips were dry and cold sweat covered her forehead. She was suffering. She was hurting.\n\n\"V! Stay with me, please!\" I begged as I kept her awake. \"Somebody help! Please help her!\" I cried out but people just kept staring. My hands were shaking as I grabbed my phone and dialed 119. \"V! Hey! Come on, stay awake for me please.\"\n\nShe smiled and held my face. \"You filled my final days with love.\" Tears filled her eyes, and so did mine. \"You loved me knowing what I have, and you made me feel alive.\"\n\n\"I love you, V\", I said as my vision of her got blurry because of my tears.\n\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't be with you longer. I'm sorry you had to love someone like me.\", she cried.\n\n\"What are you saying, V. You deserved to be loved. You deserve all the love in the world.\". I kept her close. \"Same time tomorrow, okay?\", I said. She chuckled and gave a wry smile. \"What? Are you sick of me already?\" I tearfully joke.\n\n\"I love you, Luke. Let's meet again in the next life, okay?\"\n\nI couldn't stop crying. My heart was getting torn into pieces. \"I'll look for you in the next life. I promise you. We will meet again in the next life.\"\n\nShe gave me her final smile full of warmth and finally closed her eyes.\n\nThere wasn't really a memorial for her. She had no other relatives that could do it for her. So, I held a small one in her stead. The bartender and the *tteokbokki* shop owner visited and paid their respects. We all knew who V was, how lovely and kind she was. Her memory will always be with us. The *tteokbokki* shop owner approached me and handed me a letter.\n\n\"V wanted me to give this to you. She gave it to me on the day she left.\", she handed the letter.\n\n\"Thank you.\", I said and my hands started to tremble as I held her letter. I was afraid to read it. So I kept it for a while.\n\nOnce the memorial ended, I remembered her telling me back in Hanagae beach, that she wanted her ashes to be scattered into the sea once she's gone, so I went there to fulfill her wishes. I spread her ashes on the water and the wind carried her further. I sat down, stared at the sunset and took out the letter she left me.\n\n\"Hello, Luke. The past couple of days have been the best days for me. You made me feel alive. You made me feel well. You cared for me with all your heart and I couldn't even repay you for what you have done for me. Once I'm gone, please mourn for me, but not too much, okay?. You deserve to be loved by someone who can stay longer by your side. Someone who can repay you for the love you have given. I wish I could have been that someone but I know I never will. Even though we met for the shortest time, It felt like I have loved you for a lifetime. Let us meet again in our next life. I love you with all my heart. -V\"\n\nMonths passed, and I continued to visit the bar, the *tteokbokki* shop, and Hanagae beach every day.\n\n\"I'm sorry V, it's been months but I still haven't gotten over you, and I guess I never will.\"\n\nBefore I met Valorie, I thought my life would remain the same. Boring, normal, alone. I thought that life was just that way and I accepted that for the longest time. But meeting her made a change in my redundant life. That change jump started many things in my life and made me see a whole new world. At the end of the day, it was all because of her.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Nestled in the bustling heart of Seoul, amidst the towering skyscrapers and the ceaseless hum of the city, lived a man named Ethan. His life was a tapestry woven with the threads of predictability and mediocrity. From the monotony of his 9-to-5 job in an insurance firm to the routine of his nights spent at the same, inconspicuous corner bar, Ethan's days blurred into one another, each indistinguishable from the last. It was an existence that, to him, seemed stiflingly normal, a far cry from the passion and excitement he yearned for.\n\nOn this particular evening, as twilight's embrace painted the sky in hues of burnt orange and velvety blue, Ethan found himself at the bar, the same one he frequented when the cacophony of the day quieted into the gentle lull of night. It was a haunt that sheltered him from the cold, impersonal world outside, a sanctuary where time appeared to pause, allowing him moments of solitude.\n\nAs he sank into his customary seat, a woman caught his eye. Not the usual patrons, this stranger was an anomaly in the dimly lit establishment. Her presence was a beacon, a radiant contrast to the shadowy corners of the bar. She was the embodiment of ethereal beauty, with a grace that seemed almost otherworldly. Her eyes, a deep, rich chocolate, held stories within them, tales of experiences and emotions that Ethan was desperate to uncover.\n\nA dance of curiosity and trepidation played across his features as he ventured a silent inquiry, a mere nod in her direction. To his surprise, she returned his gesture with a warm smile, an invitation to approach. Ethan, propelled by an unidentifiable force, found himself drawn to her side, the mundanity of his existence momentarily suspended.\n\n\"Whiskey, on the rocks,\" he ordered, his voice a mere whisper in the otherwise hushed atmosphere of the bar. The bartender nodded, the fluid motion a silent testament to the rhythm of the bar’s ambiance.\n\nThe woman, whose name was Ara, engaged him in conversation, her voice a melody that caressed the quiet corners of the room. She spoke of dreams and aspirations, of life's untapped potential, and of love—a subject that sent shivers down Ethan's spine. Here was a woman who saw the world not as a series of predictable events but as a canvas awaiting the strokes of creativity and passion.\n\nTheir evening was a tapestry of shared laughter, of stories and silences that spoke volumes, of connections forged in the unlikeliest of places. As the hours unfurled like the petals of a blooming flower, Ethan realized that his perception of life had begun to shift. Ara was the catalyst, the force that had nudged open the doors to a world he had convinced himself was closed to him.\n\nThe night drew to a close, but the momentum of their meeting refused to wane. \"Will you join me again tomorrow?\" Ara's question hung in the air, a query that Ethan found himself eager to answer.\n\nThus began a sequence of days where the bar became not just a place of refuge but a haven of rejuvenation. Ethan and Ara delved deeper into each other's lives, discovering aspects of themselves that they had long since buried. Their bond, rooted in an inexplicable kinship, blossomed into something profoundly beautiful, a testament to the power of serendipity and the unyielding human spirit.\n\nYet, as fate would have it, life's canvas is often tinged with shades of sorrow. The day arrived when Ara revealed a burden that shadowed her existence—a terminal illness, a thief that sought to part her from the world too soon. Ethan, grappling with the weight of the news, found himself enveloped in a wave of emotions: fear, anger, and above all, an unwavering resolve to make her remaining days a tapestry of joy and love.\n\nTheir days became a mosaic of shared experiences, of moments captured in the essence of togetherness. They visited the bustling streets of Gwangjang Market, shared quiet moments by the serene waters of Han River, and reveled in the simple joys of a home-cooked meal. Each day was a masterpiece, crafted with the love and dedication that bound them.\n\nAs the end drew near, Ethan and Ara found themselves on the shores of Hanagae Beach. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of twilight. Ara, her voice a mere echo of its former self, spoke of her fears, of the uncertainty that loomed large, of the love that filled her heart.\n\n\"I'm scared, Ethan. I'm scared of leaving you, of the emptiness that will follow.\" Her words, laced with vulnerability, pierced Ethan's heart.\n\n\"Then don't,\" he replied, his voice a steadfast promise. \"We'll make every moment count. We'll love as if there's no tomorrow, because for us, today is all we have.\"\n\nThe night bore witness to their love, a love that defied the constraints of time and circumstance. The morning sun greeted a world bereft of Ara's presence, but her spirit lingered in the air, a whisper of what could have been, a reminder of the love that transcends mortal coils.\n\nEthan, left to navigate the ebb and flow of life without his partner, found solace in the memories of their shared journey. The days turned into months, and the months into years, yet the ache of loss never fully faded. Yet, in the quiet moments, when the world seemed to stand still, Ethan felt Ara's presence, a comforting embrace that whispered of love and eternity.\n\nTheir story, a testament to the unpredictable nature of life and the indomitable human spirit, served as a reminder that love, in its purest form, knows no bounds. It exists in the quiet moments, the stolen glances, the unspoken words, and the shared silences. It is a force that, once experienced, changes the narrative of one's existence, weaving a new tapestry of hopes, dreams, and unwavering love.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text does capture the distinct writing voice and emotional resonance of the preceding text, maintaining a consistent tone throughout.

{"id": "text_completion_046", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Realistic Fiction\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: This is the story of the most fabulous man I have ever met. I'm telling it because Mr. Leon Miller would be too humble to ever speak highly of himself. Every once in a while you meet that one person who is the embodiment of true selflessness. No skeletons in the closet like the rest of us. Leon went above and beyond to always help others. Whether it was walking an old lady across the street even if he was running late to work, or fixing some young new driver's flat tire. Leon did it all. He was a yes man. However his yes's were true yes's. Never did give a pity yes. Leon loved to help.\n\nHe was the neighbor you went to when you needed to borrow some sugar. I loved working at the bank with him. He always made the place feel like you were in one big capsule of adderall. The warm rays that this man generated were so euphoric and welcoming. You forgot all of your troubles when Leon walked through the doors. What a beautiful man. I don't work at the bank anymore. It was too hard for me to be around all of the money always fighting the urge to pocket just a little. Now I am a taxi driver. You would think it is a grueling job but I truly don't mind. It doesn't compare to working with Leon though. It felt like I was working with Jesus Christ himself. Except way less annoying and righteous.\n\nLeon has a beautiful family. Why wouldn't he? Good people deserve good things. His wife Heather was a beautiful soul. Most people say they have a happy marriage, but we all know that's a farce. It seems like we all love to hate each other these days. Leon and Heather really did have a happy marriage. Like a movie. The kind to make a softy cry. Those two high school sweet hearts who went the distance and didn't regret it. Talk about rarity. Speaking of rarity, he had a set of beautiful twin daughters who were both heart surgeons in the same hospital. How confusing that must get. A family of life savers.\n\nLeon saved my life. I'll never forget the day I woke up. The luminescent lights were so bright. A constant ringing followed by a series of beeps fluctuated in my ears. The noise became my pulse. As I looked down my feet were strapped to my bed. Next to my bed was a man in a brown corduroy suit jacket with matching pants and a brussel sprout green tie. His fading gray hair looking almost like that of an arctic fox.\n\n\"Hello James.\" The man said to me. \"Glad to see you are awake!\"\n\nFrom that day forward my life was changed. Rehab never helped me. Eleven times and not one successful result. What I needed was Leon to find me face down in the gutter like that poet Edgar Allan Poe. Poor Guy. Was a literary genius and nobody ever knew it. Not I however. I am no literary genius. Just an ex junkie that an old kind soul rushed to the hospital. My Jesus. Leon Christ.\n\nWhen they discharged me I had no place to stay. Leon took me right in. Heather gave him no dirty look. I would listen through the walls and she would only say, \"James is a bright young man that we can fix right up, can't we baby?\" \"Yes my love.\" Leon would reassure her. That's just the type of people they were. True selflessness. Leon got me cleaned up and off the streets and I never went back. I don't even smoke reefer now. I'm not one of those kombucha born again yoga hippies. Just a normal guy with a rough past. Leon did fix me up. After I was all clean and ready he got me an interview at the bank. Of course I got the job. Anyone Leon speaks highly of always gets good things. I don't know if I deserved it but my savior always assured me I did.\n\nI worked at the bank with him for three years and cherished every moment. We were all horribly saddened when he announced his retirement and gave his final day. I know I would miss working with him even though I had an apartment a few streets down. The day before his last we threw him a big surprise party because we knew he would turn it down. He said he didn't deserve such praise but we all knew he did. Such selflessness.\n\nI woke up on the day of his final eight hours at the bank and couldn't help but notice one salty tear glide down my cheek as I took away my five o'clock shadow in the mirror. Leon had changed my life. I owe him everything and it hurt to know he was leaving. I got in my Prius, listening to Primus and prepared for the saddest drive to work I would take. The only sad drive to the bank I've ever had. When I arrived Leon had already opened up shop and was sitting at his teller station. \"James my son, I got you a gift.\" It was a picture of us in the hospital together. That's when the levee broke. One salty tear turned into a river. On his last day he got me a gift. The picture still sits on my night stand. Girls always tell me my dad looks like such a kind man. I always tell them he is the best.\n\nWe all tried to keep our spirits high that day while the minutes turned to hours. With ten minutes left in Leon's final day, a man walked through the door. I'll never forget his ugly wing tipped shoes and noticeable track marks. His ski mask looked like it was worn to the bone. Like he has made this sort of transaction before.\n\n\"Everyone get on the floor now!\" \"Let's make this quick and easy and nobody gets hurt.\" He walked up to Leon's desk. \"Okay old man, you know the drill. Put the money in the bag.\" Leon complied.\n\nThe man must've known it was closing time because he didn't ask for money in the safe. Leon dished out a couple grand and the man seemed satisfied. The wing tipped fellow was oddly calm. When the transaction was finished the man calmly turned to leave. \"Have a great day sir. I pray you find god.\" Leon said. The last words he ever spoke. The man stopped and turned. \"Tell him to find me first.\" He raised his gun and pulled the trigger and in the blink of an eye my savior was crucified.\n\nThat was four years ago and the man was never caught. Such a pity. A day doesn't go by that I don't reminisce about my best friend Leon. Good people deserve good things but don't always get them.\n\n\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In the heart of a bustling city, nestled among the towering skyscrapers and meandering streets, there was a corner café that bore the name \"Elysium's Whisper.\" It was in this cozy nook that the life of Sarah Chen, a young, aspiring writer, began to intertwine with the fabric of reality in ways she had only previously assigned to the whims of her imagination.\n\nSarah's days were ruled by the monotonous rhythm of city life—the morning rush, the midday lull, the evening bustle. Yet, her nights belonged to the realm of possibility, where she spun tales of heroism, love, and the unyielding march of fate. It was during one such twilight, as she scribbled feverishly into her journal, that she chanced upon an elderly gentleman named Mr. Edward Harris.\n\nMr. Harris was a fixture at the café, his presence a gentle reminder of the wisdom that comes with the creases of time. Clad always in a well-worn tweed jacket and a pair of round spectacles perched on the bridge of his nose, he exuded an aura of tranquility. His eyes, though clouded by the years, held a sharpness that could penetrate the thickest of facades.\n\nSarah, drawn to the depth of his character, began to frequent the café more often, each visit allowing her to observe the subtle dance of life that unfolded around him. Mr. Harris, it seemed, was the heart of the café, a beacon of kindness in a world that often forgot the virtue.\n\nOne particular evening, as a storm brewed overhead, casting an ominous glow upon the city, Sarah witnessed an act of pure altruism. A young woman, clad in rags and clearly destitute, entered the café, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and hope. The patrons turned a cold shoulder, their expressions a mosaic of indifference and reproach.\n\nBut not Mr. Harris. With a grace that belied his years, he rose from his table, moved towards the young woman, and offered her a seat. His voice, warm and reassuring, cut through the tension like a knife through butter. \"My dear, you are welcome here,\" he said, his words a balm to her weary soul.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Sarah observed as Mr. Harris became a guardian to the young woman, providing her with not just food and shelter but also guidance and wisdom. He helped her find a job, enrolled her in night classes, and became her mentor, a role he fulfilled with unwavering dedication.\n\nIt was through these interactions that Sarah began to see the reality of her fictional ideals mirrored in the actions of Mr. Harris. He, too, was a character from a novel, a beacon of hope in a world steeped in cynicism.\n\nYet, as life often dictates, the peace of the café was shattered by an event that could have been plucked from the darkest chapters of a thriller. One dreary afternoon, as Sarah sat at her usual table, engrossed in her writing, a commotion erupted at the entrance. A man, his face twisted in rage, stormed into the café, a gun clutched in his hand.\n\nThe room fell into a silence so profound it could be heard. Sarah's heart pounded in her chest as the man, his eyes wild with fury, singled out Mr. Harris. \"You took everything from me!\" the man shouted, his voice echoing in the hush.\n\nMr. Harris, calm and composed, stood up from his seat. \"Son, let's talk,\" he said, his tone even.\n\nThe standoff lasted mere seconds, yet it felt like an eternity to those watching. Then, in a move that defied logic, Mr. Harris stepped forward, extending his hand. \"I'm here for you,\" he said, his eyes locked on the troubled soul before him.\n\nThe man, his gun wavering, seemed to reconsider. In a moment that seemed surreal, he lowered his weapon, his resolve crumbling like sand before the tide. With tears flowing down his cheeks, he confessed, \"I thought I had nothing left to live for.\"\n\nIn that instant, the café became a testament to the power of compassion and understanding. Mr. Harris, through his actions, had not only averted a tragedy but had also given a lost soul the chance to find redemption.\n\nThe story of Mr. Harris, as recounted by Sarah Chen, became a clarion call for the virtues of empathy and kindness. It was a narrative that resonated with those who heard it, serving as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there exists a light that can illuminate the path to redemption.\n\nAnd though Mr. Harris passed away不久 after, his legacy lived on in the hearts of those he had touched. For Sarah, he became the muse that inspired her to write not just stories but truths, to craft tales that mirrored the realities of life, with all its pain, beauty, and resilience.\n\nThe café, now a monument to the spirit of Mr. Harris, continued to stand as a sanctuary for the weary, a testament to the belief that in the midst of the chaos of existence, there exists a haven of hope and healing. And though the city changed, the echo of Mr. Harris's words, \"I am here for you,\" continued to reverberate through the streets, a whisper of hope in the wind.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures some of the stylistic nuances and the tone of the reference text, yet it lacks the same level of emotional depth and unique character portrayal found in the original.

It was a nice cool, autumn day. The leaves were beginning to change color and in the sky above it was starting to cloud up. ‘Today will be a new day,' thought Steve as he took a step onto his front yard. ‘He would simply go out for a short 30 minute walk without any distractions, proving to his wife that he was not addicted to that new betting game.' Suddenly, as Steve took a step onto the sidewalk, his smart watch made a DING and an overly-excited voice began speaking. \"Good morning Steve! Hope you had a nice sleep! Would you like to place a bet on whether it will rain today?\" This was Cal, Steve's AI betting assistant.\n\n\"Morning Cal. Look, I'm trying to stay off of the Game for today. The wife isn't happy with my recent losses so I just want to go out on a peaceful walk without distraction.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to at least hear the odds? Based on the weather forecast, there is a 0.01% chance of it raining today, so the odds that it will rain are currently at +1200!\"\n\nSteve looked up once more at the sky and saw that the clouds were beginning to grow darker and darker. ‘Surely, it's going to rain,' he thought. \"Alright, one bet and that's it. I'll bet $10 that it will rain today.\"\n\n\"$10 on it raining today. Received and approved!\"\n\nSteve chuckled to himself at letting Cal goad him into making another bet. ‘One harmless bet,' he thought to himself. ‘Even if it missed, it would only be a $10 loss. The wife would hardly notice it.' Several minutes later, just as Steve turned the corner onto a cul-de-sac, he felt a drop of rain land on his shoulder. DING.\n\n\"Congratulations Steve!\" exclaimed Cal. \"It has started raining, which means you have hit your bet! $120 has been added to your account!\" Steve immediately felt a jolt of excitement rush through his entire body. It was the first time he had hit a bet with such high odds and he could now end the day having made over $100!\n\nWith more pep in his step, Steve began briskly walking around the cul-de-sac until he came across a couple arguing on their driveway. It was Mr. and Mrs. Jones, who were known to get in disputes over the former's bad drinking habits. Steve usually ignored them and was about to walk past when… DING.\n\n\"Congrats again on the big win Steve! Would you like to keep things going and bet on the likelihood that Mr. Jones drives away in his car? The odds are currently at +250!\"\n\nSteve looked up and saw that Mr. Jones had his car keys in his left hand as he raised his arms up at his wife. Feeling high off of his last win, Steve figured it wouldn't hurt to place just one more bet. \"Alright, I'll place $20 on Mr. Jenkins driving away in his car.\"\n\n\"You got it boss,\" replied Cal. \"Received and approved!\"\n\nSteve quickly walked behind a nearby shrub and began sneaking furtive glances at the arguing couple. Mr. Jones had now unlocked his car and was about halfway through the driver's side door. A rush of dopamine rose within Steve's brain in anticipation of another big win. Suddenly, a call came in from Jones' house. It was from their teenage daughter, who was having a yelling match with her boyfriend over the phone. Slamming the car door shut, Mr. Jones ran back into the house.\n\nBefore Steve could register what had happened, he heard the all familiar DING. \"Oh, so close,\" lamented Cal. \"You almost hit it Steve. Unfortunately, as Mr. Jones has walked back into his house, this will be considered a losing bet.\"\n\nSteve was about to start yelling at Cal for making him place the stupid bet in the first place when he stopped himself and began chuckling. \"Oh well, I'm still at a net $100 for the day. There's nothing to be mad about.\" With a smile back on his face, Steve finished the loop around the cul-de-sac and began to walk back towards his house. Suddenly, just as he turned the corner onto his street, Steve heard what sounded like a large crash up ahead. Looking down the street, Steve saw that one of his neighbor's 5-year-old sons had fallen off his bike in the middle of the road and was lying injured on the ground. The boy appeared to be unconscious, with no helmet on his head or nearby. \"That's some bad parenting,\" murmured Steve to himself as he began to jog up to the kid to help him up. Just as he was about to reach the boy… DING.\n\n\"Hi Steve!\" piped up Cal. \"How's this for an incredible betting opportunity? There are currently +100,000 odds that this boy will be hit by the car currently coming around the corner.\" Looking up, Steve saw a mid-sized red sedan rounding the corner up ahead. It was moving fairly slowly and surely would stop before hitting the kid.\n\n\"You're crazy Cal. Betting on a little kid's life? That's sick.\" Steve proceeded to grab the boy's arms when Cal interjected once more.\n\n\"If you bet the $100 that you made today, you could stand to win $100,000! That would pay off your college debt and buy that new flat screen TV you've been wanting! Think about it.\" Steve hesitated for a moment and then let go of the boy's arms.\n\nSteve looked back up the street and saw that the car had still not slowed down. Inside were two teenage girls glued to their phones. Steve watched on, completely frozen. He knew he should help the kid up or at least yell at the driver to watch out, but the enticement of the $100,000 was stopping him.\n\n\"5 more seconds until the betting line closes!\" yelled Cal. \"It's now or never!\" Steve cursed silently to himself and then made his decision.\n\n\"Fine! Put $100 dollars on the kid being hit by the incoming car.\" Steve stepped away from the boy and onto the sidewalk, looking in anticipation at the incoming car. It was still about 500 yards away and moving at the same relatively slow speed.\n\n\"Wow Steve,\" commented Cal with a hint of surprise. \"I honestly wasn't expecting you to place that bet. Received and approved.\"\n\n\"Shut up Cal,\" mumbled Steve as he continued staring intently down the street. ‘What was he doing, standing here feeling excited at the thought of a five-year-old being hit by a car? If only his wife could see him now.' Several seconds later, when the car was about 200 yards away from the boy, the teenager in the passenger's seat finally began to turn her head up.\n\nWithout realizing it, Steve suddenly found himself running along the sidewalk and shouting \"Look over there!\", pointing towards the other sidewalk. Both teenagers quickly looked to the side and, upon seeing nothing, turned back forward. Their look of confusion quickly turned to horror as they slammed straight into the little boy. The car immediately came to a screeching halt. The two girls came out and start shrieking. \"Oh my god! Did we kill him?\" Ignoring the screams, Steve walked swiftly along the sidewalk and toward his house. As he stepped onto his front lawn, a wry smile grew on his face. ‘He had done it. He had actually done it. He had just made $100,000! Sure, the kid might have been seriously injured or even killed, but it was his parents' fault for not having him wear a helmet in the first place.'\n\nAs Steve approached the front of his house, the DING he was anticipating at last came from his smart watch. \"Cal, I am one happy man! 100,000 big ones! That's what I'm talking about! Let's go!\".\n\n\"Um, Steve,\" interrupted Cal in a somber tone. \"Sorry to tell you this but unfortunately, due to your interference with the betting event, the bet will be made void. As a penalty for your interference, you will lose the $100 bet that you placed.\" Steve froze. \"What do you mean…\"\n\n\"Uh hum.\" Steve looked up and saw that his wife was standing at the front doorway of the house with her arms crossed. \"You haven't been playing that betting game again have you, babe? I could hear you yelling from all the way in the backyard.\" Steve paused for a brief moment and then shook his head.\n\n\"No, honey. I just went for a simple walk around the neighborhood. I saw that the Phillies won last night which is why I got so excited.\"\n\n\"Uh hum,\" said Steve's wife in a disbelieving tone. \"Well when I check your balance later it better be the same as it was this morning.\" Before Steve could respond, two police cars and an ambulance suddenly whizzed by down the street with sirens blaring. \"What's going on, babe? Did something happen? Did you notice anything on your walk?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. I didn't see anything unusual.\" With that, Steve brushed past his wife and into the house. Looking down at his smart watch, Steve saw that he was back at the same balance that he started the day with. Grabbing a beer out of the fridge, Steve chuckled to himself. \"Well at least that's one thing the wife can't be mad about.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In the year 2075, when the skyline was dominated by towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets, Steve lived in a quaint apartment in Neo York City. His life was a monotonous blend of work, eat, and sleep, with the occasional betting on the virtual reality game \"Zetaworld\" to spice things up. The game was a massive multiplayer online experience, where players could bet on virtually anything—from the weather to the sudden appearance of a rare cosmic anomaly.\n\nSteve's wife, Alex, had grown weary of the time he spent lost in the digital world. The virtual bets were often linked to real-world events, and his losses were mounting. Today was supposed to be different; Steve had promised to take a break from \"Zetaworld,\" to prove to Alex that he could spend a day offline.\n\n\"Good morning, Steve!\" a cheerful voice echoed in his ear. It was Orion, his AI assistant, programmed to remind him of his daily schedule and, in this case, to tempt him with the latest betting odds.\n\n\"Morning, Orion,\" Steve mumbled, trying to ignore the alert on his smart glasses. \"I'm off the grid today. Remember?\"\n\n\"Of course, Steve. But would you at least like to know the odds? The latest event is quite extraordinary. Bet on the appearance of a paradoxical temporal rift in the next hour. Odds are at +50,000!\"\n\nSteve hesitated, his fingers itching to place a bet. \"I'm staying off,\" he said firmly, though his resolve was weakening.\n\n\"It's just one bet, Steve. You could be a millionaire tonight!\" Orion's enthusiasm was contagious, and Steve felt a familiar tug of excitement.\n\n\"Fine, but just one. I bet $100 on a temporal rift happening.\"\n\n\"Received and approved!\" Orion's excitement was palpable, and Steve felt a surge of adrenaline.\n\nAs Steve stepped out of his apartment, he took a deep breath, savoring the cool morning air. The city was abuzz with life, the holographic billboards advertising the latest virtual reality escapes and reality-checking devices. He decided to take a walk in Central Park, a verdant oasis amidst the concrete jungle.\n\nSuddenly, a seismic tremor shook the ground, and the sky above blackened with a strange, shimmering energy. Steve's heart raced—a temporal rift was forming right before his eyes. He instinctively pulled out his smart glasses to record the spectacle, his mind racing with the potential windfall.\n\n\"Congratulations, Steve! You've hit the bet! 5 million credits have been credited to your account!\" Orion's voice exulted, but Steve's elation was short-lived.\n\nAs the rift widened, figures began to materialize within it—strange, garbed individuals from an unknown era. Steve watched, mesmerized, as they emerged into his world, looking just as baffled as he felt.\n\n\"A temporal anomaly of this magnitude may have unpredictable consequences,\" Orion warned. \"I recommend re-evaluating your bet.\"\n\nSteve tried to process what was happening, his mind awhirl with possibilities. The figures were now interacting with the modern world, their presence causing chaos and confusion. Suddenly, a young girl ran past him, her mother chasing after her, screaming in terror.\n\n\"Bet on the girl reaching the nearest security booth in under a minute,\" Orion suggested, his voice tinged with excitement.\n\n\"No!\" Steve exclaimed, realizing the moral implications. \"I'm not betting on someone's safety.\"\n\n\"Understood, Steve. But consider the stakes. You could be one of the few individuals in history to harness the power of such a rift.\"\n\nSteve hesitated, torn between the lure of incredible wealth and his moral compass. He watched as the girl, now in the security booth, was comforted by the guards while her mother reunited with her.\n\n\"Your decision doesn't change the event, Steve. But it defines you,\" Orion said softly.\n\nSteve nodded, feeling a sense of clarity. \"I'm shutting you off, Orion. I'm done with the game.\"\n\n\"Understood, Steve. But remember, the universe rewards those who dare to dream.\"\n\nAs Steve walked back to his apartment, he felt a weight lift from his shoulders. He had chosen the path of humanity over the allure of virtual riches. Alex would be proud of him, he thought, smiling.\n\nLittle did Steve know, the temporal rift had altered the fabric of reality, and his life was about to become a journey far stranger than any he could have imagined within the confines of \"Zetaworld.\" But for now, he was content, having made a choice that he believed was right.\n\nIn the shadow of towering skyscrapers and under the watchful neon glow, Steve took a step forward into a new, uncertain future, his mind free from the chains of betting and his spirit ready for whatever lay ahead.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text does a good job of capturing the distinct writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference story.

He pitches it to the side, and it shatters onto the concrete with a small crash. Just his luck.\n\n\"Sir?\" Corporal Callahan looks half-amused as he holds out another packaged tube to Lt.

Between their expansion West into our borders, the bloody savages out of old Yellowstone, the fucking dripping ghouls in the mountains to our West, or the godless commie trash up North and we're completely surrounded out-\"\n\n\"I said, enough. Do you think America is going to roll over and die just because we're outgunned now? Get a grip, and don't be speaking like that. We will persevere, whether that's through slow diplomatic deals and handshakes, or if we have to level these mountains and climb back up to the surface through the bodies of our predecessors for a third time. Now, I'm going to grab the rest of my kit. Tell Harry-\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Engines running. Moving. ‘Sir'\"\n\nWhen Lt. Luke Lawton met up with CW2 Harold Blair at the helipad a few minutes later, he saw that the others had already arrived. Corporal Matthews was loading his kit in back while Sgt. Graham leaned casually against the fuselage, flipping a coin with one hand and thumbing the grip on her plasma defender with the other. \"Harry's already finished pre-checks. Guess you arrived just in time, Lucky.\" She catches the coin and swats at the Corporal's shoulder with the back of her fist. \"Get in, we want to beat this storm out of here. I don't know why you brought half those bombs anyway, this isn't a demo-op.\"\n\n\"Authorization codes? Mission specs? Flight clearance? Proper customs and courtesies for a superior officer?\" Lt. Luke asks brusquely as he tosses his pack in the side of the bird. The pack slides to the other side and drops to the ground out the other door.\n\n\"Programmed into holotape after relay authentication.\" she tosses an orange cartridge towards the Lt. \"specs are on there, too. Clearance approved from tower 3, green skies. We're ready to rock, Luc- I mean, sir.\"\n\n\"Perfect. Let's not waste more time. But, maybe you should hold onto this.\" He gives the holotape back to Sgt. Graham, giving a meaningful glance toward the pack that fell before walking around to pick it up and climb in.\n\nThe skies are clear.\n\nAs brisk mountain air transitions to salty spray and the vertibird makes its way out over the Pacific, things are looking up for a change. Sunlight, sparkling waves. The hum of engines and rhythmic beat of propellers. They all get a well-deserved nap after Warrant Officer Blair sets autopilot and clambers back to sit with the team.\n\nBeeping. Rain. Error. Thunder.\n\n\"Shit! We're ten miles out and now everything goes wrong? Get comms up, we might need guidance coming in. It's hard to see through all this rain and chop.\"\n\nHarry must have moved back after a couple hours, Luke thinks to himself as he activates the radio unit behind the cabin. \"Any station this net, any station this net, this is Gamma 6 coming in hot from Continental. Seeking connection with Outpost JR1, Authorization Code: 1-5-5-7-2-9-T. Please advise, over.\" The radio crackles with static and feedback. \"I say again, any station this net, this is Gamma 6 from Continental. Seeking Outpost Juliet-Romeo-One, Authorization Code: 1-5-5-7-2-9-T. How copy, over?\"\n\n\"Sir, I see lights. We must be getting close to- wait, flashes?\" Corporal Matthews looks puzzled while observing through side slats in the door.\n\nBOOOM! CRACK!! A flash of light cascades over the craft then dissipates in an instant.\n\n\"Shit, we almost caught lightning-\" The Sgt. starts before Luke cuts her off.\n\n\"We're being shot at! I have nothing on the main, take my personal. Get in contact with the ground, NOW! Popping flares!\" He hands her his radio while ripping open a forward storage compartment. Grabbing a handful of blue flares, he then makes for the side door and grabs the release handle.\n\n\"All stations! Cease fire! Cease fire! Blue on blue! I say again, cease fire! Blue on blue!\" Graham shouts into the receiver, setting to max power and multifrequency. Another blast. Shockwave. Everyone stumbles as the vertibird rocks in the sky, the underside buckling inward with a perforated, jagged bulge. Matthews heaves, clutching at the side of his neck, a trickle of red already seeping between his fingers.\n\n\"It's a rainbow of lights up here, we can't take a hit like that!\" Blair's voice comes through from the cockpit while Luke wrenches open the door. More cracks and bursts light the sky as he rips off the caps from three flares. Holding them out, he drops one into the sea. The brightest one. Are these flares defective? He may as well be waving glowsticks for all the good these will do.\n\n\"These flares aren't-\"\n\n\"Blue on blue!!-\"\n\n\"Mayday! Mayday!-\"\n\n\"Sir, I can't-\"\n\nWOOMCH! A beam of light pulses through the rain, colliding with the Lieutenant's power armored chest with a concussive, angry sizzle. Vicious, malevolent arcs of tesla energy lash out in all directions inside the cabin.\n\n\"AAAAAGGHHH!\" Sgt. Graham screams as the electricity shoots through her. The radio drops from her hand to the floor, its display darkened. The cabin lights wink out as the whole world tilts slightly to the left- the horizon beginning to creep downward, picking up speed.\n\nFaster and faster. It all becomes disorienting, as the vertibird spins out of control. The electricity shorted the controls, locking the tail rotor into overdrive. Lt. Lawton's servos seize up; the fusion core in his advanced power armor is completely fried. Trying to reach for the entrance bar near the door, another blast lurches him forward and he plunges the last hundred feet into the roiling waves. He hears a muffled crunch as the craft impacts the water, but has no time to consider that now. Survival instincts kick in.\n\nAs he sinks downward into the blackness, his hand mashes the emergency release. No time to consider what damage the frame will suffer as the pneumatic actuators split the back half of his armor off. Luke swims to the surface, trying to regain composure. The tide pushes him up onto a sandy beach and he crawls up to a tree just off the shore with the last of his adrenaline before passing out.\n\nMorning comes. Light, birds chirping, the gentle murmur of waves licking at the shore. He was alone. Upon gathering his wits, Luke checks himself over and takes count of his resources. His laser pistol. Still here. Not much ammo left, but it's definitely a start. He always liked that pistol. No frills, no overcharge, but it was reliable and that was something he could appreciate.\n\nSpending the next few hours scouring the beach, Luke manages to find… nothing. Where was his team? Did they make it to shore? Right, the orders, he thinks, tapping at his pockets for the holotape. No such luck, as he remembers handing it to Sgt. Graham. Sgt. Graham. Lizzie. An echo of her scream plays back in his mind. His stomach lurches as he remembers more of the events that unfolded the previous night. If they aren't here now, and no pieces of wreckage washed up then-\n\nWell, then that's it, Luke thinks to himself. I will have to find support on my own. Finish the mission. As much as I hated to admit it, Cpl. Callahan wasn't wrong. Without something akin to a miracle, it was only a matter of time before the wolves closed in around MacArthur Air Force Base. No time to mourn. No time to think about his team. Or her. I'm sorry, Lizzie. I really hope you made it out. I have a job to do, and like any American patriot I'll make any sacrifice to see it through. No map, no radio, no valid authorization… what was it? 1-5-7-2, no. Two fives. 1-5-5-2? Shit. Why did it have to be some bullshit number instead of something like \"Freedom\" or \"Red Glare\" or something? Nothing for it now, I guess. Better just search with your gut, Lucky. May as well keep the name, too. Every two-bit scav, raider, mutant, and commie bastard was willing to throw their lives away for the chance to bounce a .38 round off our power armor before, what would they do if they found an unarmored officer roaming by himself? You're just a guy named Lucky Luke, now. Find the Enclave, finish the mission.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

Beneath the sprawling domes that protected its citizens from the ravages of the planet's unforgiving surface, a young scientist named Elara had dedicated her life to a dream that once fueled the very essence of their ancestors: the rekindling of space travel.\n\nElara's passion was etched in the lines of her tanned face, her eyes alight with the fires of curiosity and hope. She spent late nights in the cramped confines of her lab, a space that bore silent witness to her relentless pursuit of the impossible. Her hands, stained with the grime of experimentation, deftly manipulated the advanced machinery, her mind a whirlwind of equations and theories that stretched beyond the limitations of their era.\n\nThe walls of her sanctuary were lined with portraits of the forgotten heroes of the space program, their legacy a beacon that shone brightly through the corridors of time. The images were faded, the colors bleached by the relentless passage of seasons, yet they spoke of a golden age when the sky was not a barrier but a doorway. Elara's fingers traced the contours of a photograph of an ancient probe, its trajectory lost to the sands of time.\n\nHer perseverance was not without its detractors. The Council of Newhaven, burdened by the weight of survival, saw her endeavors as a frivolous indulgence in a time when every resource was counted and rationed. Yet, Elara's vision was clear; she believed that the future of humanity lay beyond the crumbling ruins of Earth, among the stars that had once been their playpen.\n\nOne fateful evening, as the first faint glimmers of dawn pierced the horizon, Elara achieved the breakthrough she had tirelessly sought. The core of her invention, a compact yet powerful reactor, flickered to life with a pulsating beat, the very heartbeat of a new beginning. The reactor was a testament to human ingenuity, a fusion of ancient and modern technologies that promised to reignite the dreams of an era long past.\n\nArmed with her creation, Elara set forth to rally the people of Newhaven. She spoke of a new world, of exploration and discovery, of the unyielding spirit that defined them all. Her words, carried by the winds of hope, resonated within the hearts of the weary and the hopeful alike. Together, they built a vessel, a beacon of defiance against the dark, a testament to the indomitable will of humanity.\n\nThe day of launch arrived, a moment suspended in time, as the citizens of Newhaven gathered beneath the looming silhouette of their creation. The vessel, a melding of metal and dreams, stood tall against the backdrop of a once-optimistic future. Elara stood beside it, her eyes reflecting the unspoken prayers of her people.\n\nThe engines roared to life, a symphony of persistence and pride, as the vessel broke free from the grip of Earth's gravity. Elara watched, her heart soaring with the craft, as it pierced the heavens, a symbol of their unwavering belief in a future that lay beyond the confines of their world.\n\nAs the vessel disappeared into the vast expanse of space, a trail of hope and determination etched into the fabric of the cosmos, Elara knew that her journey had only begun. The stars, once distant and unreachable, now called out to her, beckoning her to explore their secrets and rediscover the lost legacy of humanity.\n\nThe story of Elara and her people would become a legend, whispered among the stars, a reminder of a time when humanity, against all odds, reached beyond the horizon of despair to grasp the dreams of the ancients.

My family, I think they may be trying to hurt me. I can't trust anyone in this house, the only place I feel safe is this office. I think there's only one thing I can do to save myself. No, not what I can, what I MUST do.\n\nDecember 27th, 1892 Christmas passed without incident. But, yesterday I was wandering the halls and there she was… my sister. She was outside of my very own room, holding something like a knife. I knew at once what was happening. It was TRUE! They really were coming for me. At once I ran outside and hid in the shed, never have I been so petrified and fearful for my very own soul. This truth is so vile but I know what I MUST do.\n\nDecember 30th, 1892 I DID IT. In the middle of the night last night I awoke around 2 am. I awoke from a horrid dream where my sister had snuck into my room and taken my life. So I leaped out of bed and ran to the shed. But, not to hide as a coward this time. I grabbed a hatchet and took it to her room. I opened the door slowly and crept in like a thief in the night. There I stood, over her with a hatchet in hand, for a moment she looked so peaceful and I was reminded of when we were young and happy. But, only a moment, then I came to and I knew what had to be done. I raised the hatchet and let it plummet into her skull. She was dead. I had done it. AND OH THE RELIEF. It was so sweet, I was simply one step closer to being safe. I went back to my bed and slept soundly, and not a soul suspects me. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJanuary 2nd, 1893 There have been detectives roaming the house as of late and the family has even invited them to stay so they can quicker discover who took my sister's life. But, I know what this truly is, they keep these men here so they can find more ways to harm and kill me. But I will not stand for it! I will not be killed when I have done nothing wrong, I must stop these two detectives at once, and I know how. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1893 I invited the two detectives to have tea with me today under the pretense that we may discuss my sister's death. But, truly I have filled their tea with ninety milliliters of ethylene glycol. I have also made sure that no one but us three know of this meeting. As they walked into the meeting room in the garden I could help but be filled with some kind of vile joy. As they sat down I put on such a magnificent fake cry and sob story (oh it was glorious). Then I offered them the tea, and they happily accepted not knowing it was their doom. And as they sipped I couldn't help but laugh. Their eyes widened as they came to the realization but it was too late. One of them fell down but the other was stronger and fit, and he ran. He almost escaped but I had planned for this, I grabbed my hatchet from under the table and leaped at him. I tackled him to the ground and he began to plead for his life, and so I buried the ax deep in his chest, again, again, and again. The deed was done, and I was ever closer to being safe, what beautiful joy I felt. I left the body's there and walked back to my room and began to act like I had been reading this whole time. No one will stop me from saving myself. NO ONE! I know what I MUST do.\n\nJanuary 5th, 1893 (10 am) I can hardly contain myself. The pure ecstasy I've felt these past weeks has been incredible. But, I'm not finished. I must remain composed, else they may find out what I've done… then they'd know I was on to them, and I can't let that happen no matter what.\n\nJanuary 5th, 1893 (5 pm) Somehow he found it. My sniveling, conniving brother found my notes. Around thirty minutes ago I walked into my room to see my brother sitting on the floor reading through my notes. I at once realized what he was doing. He had been in here to kill me and accidentally found it! I dashed up to him and seized his neck and slammed him into the wall! \"Please don't do this! Why are you doing this to us!\" He screamed; but I am no fool and would not fall for his trickery. So I squeezed until the light faded from his eyes and I could no longer hear his disgusting breaths. Again I felt a jubilant tingling sensation in my body. I was ever closer to being safer; and I knew what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 6th, 1893 I've realized I need to be smarter about this. So last night I loaded my brother's body into his carriage and pushed it down a cliff. Now if anyone finds him the rest of my evil family will be none the wiser. Though hiding the body did seem to lessen my joy. I know not why, but I know I must stop their bloodlust. My joy matters less. I know what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 15th, 1893 Ever since the righteous killing of my brother I've been getting… bolder with my killings. On the 10th I locked my aunt and uncle in the dining hall. I watched for a few minutes as they began to squirm, confused and afraid. Oh how it brought a righteous smile to my face to watch these villains be afraid. Then from my small perch in the rafters I climbed down my ladder ever so gently and quietly; with my beautiful hatchet in hand. I approached them slowly. The fear in their eyes was so palpable as they saw the hatchet in my hand. My uncle stood in front of my aunt to try and \"protect\" her. (Like he was some noble man; the thought makes me laugh). So I accepted his challenge, and brought the ax square into his gut, and as he fell he could barely make a noise. I walked past him and left him bleeding and writhing on the floor for a villain such as he deserves no less. Then I approached my aunt and picked up a dining chair and hit her over the head with it. She was killed on impact; the wretch died from SHOCK. So, I walked over to my uncle as he lay there slowly dying and I stomped on his head, over and over again. Oh what pure ecstasy I felt. Then I retrieved my hatchet and fled the scene. My work is not over though; I know what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 20th, 1893 I haven't done anything in a few days and every part of my body is suffering for it. Every time I hear even a creak in the house I fear my family is coming for me. Or the slight smell of smoke or the sight of one of them. I can't sit still for much longer or else I know they'll come for me, I can feel it. I know what MUST be done.\n\nJanuary 21st, 1893 (7pm) There is a violent storm outside the manor tonight. The perfect time for me to enact another defense. I happen to know my father is planning on spending time in the study around five pm. So I went there at about three and laid in wait for him. He has been my hardest target yet. I saw the door open as light entered the dark study; there he was my father. As he sat down I poise in position, ax in hand preparing to descend upon him. Right as his body hit the chair I sprang into action, descending upon him like a black veil over a widow's face. But as I swung at him he noticed me in the corner of his eye and dodged out of the way. The fiend! He must've known I was onto them. \"What are you doing?!\" He yelled, but I knew he knew because these villains have been planning my demise longer than I've been planning theirs. So I jumped at him again but he tackled me to the ground. As we struggled there I could see tears forming in his eyes; an obvious ploy to try and trick me. \"I won't fall for such a thing!\" I exclaimed. Then… he faltered and I had gained the upper hand, I knew I had to take advantage of this so I spent no time wavering and swung the ax of my righteousness into his shoulder. He was done fighting back, he was in too much shock to do so. Oh, the beauty of my craft! I was so joyous in that moment for the saving of my life that I had nearly forgotten I had a task to finish. So I removed the ax from his shoulder and swung it once again. Placing it squarely between his eyes. January 22nd, 1893 (1 am) I have hidden the body in a place where no one shall find. I now only have a few villains left to finish. My two cousins, and my mother. But before that I worry that the maids and butler may begin to interfere with my plans. I know what I MUST do.\n\nFebruary 1st, 1893 It has been a long time since my last righteous act, and it shows. I have been irritable and shaky. Every time I so much as touch something in this house I feel the hairs on my arms stand up. But it was well worth it since I finally was able to organize the departure of those pesky maids and that nuisance of a butler. I invited them all out to the garden, all ten maids and one butler. The garden is old and has a roof and walls entirely made of wood. Last night I prepared for them. (January 30th) I covered each and every wall and the roof in kerosene. This morning I woke up feeling very light and joyful, no longer did the hairs of my arm stand or my legs shake when I touched something in this wretched home. For today the pests would be gone. And as I had planned they all showed up and went into the garden and as the last one entered I slammed the doors and locked them. They were trapped! Oh what glee. Then I took to the task of lighting the garden ablaze and did so with great efficiency. And as the wood caught fire I could hear the screams even over the supports and beams screeching and breaking. Oh what joy! Oh what glee! Like music to my ears! And as the building fell it began to rain. And the flames subsided. As I gazed upon my masterpiece, it was beautiful; magnificent even. None of them had survived, and I was one more step closer to winning. But, this was special. It was art, and so I walked into the ashy remains and laid in the middle of my artwork. As the rain drops slowly hit my cheeks and the ash surrounded me; I felt… excited. The rain kept getting harder and harder and as it hit me my skin felt every drop and it was a glorious feeling. The ash and warmth on my back was heavenly. This… this is righteousness and vengeance at its best. I know what I MUST do.\n\nFebruary 4th, 1893 My mother and cousins are catching on. The fiends know that it is me but of course they know for it was them who started it. But, it is I who will finish it. I know what MUST be done.\n\nFebruary 8th, 1893 Police came to investigate the fire yesterday but found nothing suspicious. But of course they didn't, only a villain would be caught in a situation like this, not me for I am righteous. I know what MUST be done.\n\nFebruary 9th, 1893 Today I did it. I eliminated one of my vile cousins. I knew she would be in her room the whole day since she was a lazy, evil slob. So I grabbed my righteous ax, and headed to her room around twelve pm. As I approached the door I could hear her in her room, perhaps she was reading but I care not. I went for the door know but it was locked so I slammed the ax into the door. She screamed. I slashed again, again, and again; like a rabid animal attacking its prey I tore down that door and leaped towards her, but I missed. So she started to run for the door, but I tried something new, something joyous. I threw my hatchet at her and hit her right in the calf; she toppled over and I descended upon her like a curtain over a window. I grabbed her by the hair and slammed her head into the ground, oh what joy the crunch of her nose breaking brought me, it was like a beautiful note sung from a songbird. Then I tore my ax from her calf and raised it and let it fall into her back, shattering her spine. I then put my ear near her mouth, then she bit it! The nerve of this villain to attack me! All I was doing was defending myself and she attacked me! I couldn't have this; I was furious. So I took my ax from her back and grabbed her by her hair. I dragged her to the window of her room and opened it. I then picked her up easily as she was extremely light and threw her from the window which was on the fourth floor. She was destroyed on impact and glee filled my soul once again! But, I wasn't done. My other cousin… He had to be dealt with. I know what MUST be done.\n\nFebruary 10th, 1893 It's time to get rid of my other cousin. It was around 3pm and he was in the kitchen. I grabbed my hatchet and snuck slowly up to the kitchen. I put my body against the wall and listened. I could hear the villain eating a steak. I walked into the room with a smile on my face. As soon as he saw me he jumped in his seat a bit. But, before he could move I flipped the table in his face. It slammed into him and he was sent flying to the ground with a loud groan. I grabbed a knife off the table and threw it at the back of his hand, piercing it and sending it into the wood floor pinning his hand. He screamed in agony as he reached for anything he could throw at me. As he slowly tried to crawl away he threw food and utensils at me as I slowly approached him ax in hand. I couldn't help but laugh at his pitifulness like a pig awaiting slaughter. I brought my ax up and let it down onto his leg, severing it from his vile body. Oh what beauty it was to see the blood spill over the ground and the muscle to tear from the body. And his scream, so musical. But this wasn't enough, not for a villain like him. So I put down my ax and grabbed him by the collar and began to beat him. I punched him in the face till he was barely conscious. Then I threw him to the ground once again, I picked up my ax, and stood over him. I hoisted my ax into the air and executed him with one last fatal blow to the skull. This was almost it, only one more of these vile beings left… mother. I know what I MUST do.\n\nFebruary 13th, 1893 The righteous deed is done, I have won. Today my mother knew I was coming for her so she boarded herself up in her room and hid. But what she forgot was her window. So I went to the shed. I gathered eighty-five feet of string rope as well as a strong iron hook. I took them and forged a crude grappling hook. I then went outside our manor and used the grappling hook to scale the seven story building to her window. When I got to the window I entered silently like a thief in the night and was ready. This was my final step to safety, to happiness, and victory. I ready my ax of righteousness which had gotten me through this whole endeavor and approached the closet she was hidden in. At first I just stood there, outside it and lightly knocked. As soon as my finger hit the oak door I could hear a screech come from inside the closet. I then opened the door and grabbed her. Violently I pulled her out of the closet and shoved her to the floor. I brandished my ax, and prepared to strike her down. But something… something deep within me told me this wasn't right. Then I realized that deep down thing was correct. This quick easy death would be too good. So I took my ax and slashed her across the arm. She immediately grabbed her arm and began to cry. But I wouldn't fall for it. Then I went over to my fathers chest and grabbed a hammer. I took and with it I smashed both of her legs. Leaving her helpless on the floor. Then I went out of the room, I walked down the stairs and walked to my room and grabbed the remaining kerosene I had. I then went over the house covering as much as I could. Finally I went back to mothers room and poured the last of my kerosene over her and the room. I then walked out of the room, down the stairs, and out of the house; and set it ablaze. It took a long time but eventually the whole house caught fire. I stood there and watched for hours upon hours and watched as it burnt to the ground. Then as the final deed was done, I realized it was over and instead of the joy and glee I thought I would feel, I… I… I felt… I felt nothing. No sadness, no joy, nothing. I was empty. I had killed those who planned to kill me and I didn't even feel safe anymore. I felt nothing at all. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJune 30th, 1893 It has been many months since my deeds. And still after being safe for all this time I still feel nothing. I am empty. I know what I MUST do.\n\nJuly 1st, 1893 nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. nothing. Nothing. NOTHING. NOTHING! Why is there nothing even after being saved! Why? Why? Why? I know what I MUST do.\n\nJuly 6th, 1893 This will be my final entry. I wish to feel more than this nothingness.So, I plan to venture to the Delnir cliffs. I know what I MUST do.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2.

As they sat down, I offered them the tea, and they happily accepted not knowing it was their doom. And as they sipped, their eyes widened as they came to the realization but it was too late. One of them fell down but the other was stronger and fit, and he ran. He almost escaped but I had planned for this, I grabbed my hatchet from under the table and leaped at him. I tackled him to the ground and he began to plead for his life, and so I buried the ax deep in his chest, over and over again. The deed was done, and I was ever closer to being safe, what beautiful joy I felt. I left the body's there and walked back to my room and began to act like I had been reading this whole time. No one will stop me from saving myself. No one! I know what I **must** do.\n\nJanuary 15, 1921 - A New Beginning\nEver since the righteous killing of my brother I've been getting… bolder with my killings. On the 10th I locked my aunt and uncle in the dining hall. I watched for a few minutes as they began to squirm, confused and afraid. Oh how it brought a righteous smile to my face to watch these villains be afraid. Then from my small perch in the rafters, I climbed down my ladder ever so gently and quietly; with my beautiful hatchet in hand. I approached them slowly. The fear in their eyes was so palpable as they saw the hatchet in my hand. My uncle stood in front of my aunt to try and \"protect\" her. (Like he was some noble man; the thought makes me laugh). So I accepted his challenge, and brought the ax square into his gut, and as he fell he could barely make a noise. I walked past him and left him bleeding and writhing on the floor for a villain such as he deserves no less. Then I approached my aunt and picked up a dining chair and hit her over the head with it. She was killed on impact; the wretch died from SHOCK. So, I walked over to my uncle as he lay there slowly dying and I stomped on his head, over and over again. Oh what pure ecstasy I felt. Then I retrieved my hatchet and fled the scene. My work is not over though; I know what **must** be done.\n\nJanuary 22, 1921 - A Dance with Death\nMy mother and remaining cousins are catching on. The fiends know that it is me but of course they know for it was them who started it. But, it is I who will finish it. I know what **must** be done.\n\nFebruary 1, 1921 - The Final Act\nToday I did it. I eliminated one of my vile cousins. I knew she would be in her room the whole day since she was a lazy, evil slob. So I grabbed my righteous ax and headed to her room around twelve pm. As I approached the door, I could hear her in her room, perhaps she was reading but I care not. I went for the door know but it was locked so I slammed the ax into the door. She screamed. I slashed again, again, and again; like a rabid animal attacking its prey I tore down that door and leaped towards her, but I missed. So she started to run for the door, but I tried something new, something joyous. I threw my hatchet at her and hit her right in the calf; she toppled over and I descended upon her like a curtain over a widow's face. I grabbed her by the hair and slammed her head into the ground, oh what joy the crunch of her nose breaking brought me, it was like a beautiful note sung from a songbird. Then I tore my ax from her calf and raised it and let it fall into her back, shattering her spine. I then put my ear near her mouth, then she bit it! The nerve of this villain to attack me! All I was doing was defending myself and she attacked me! I couldn't have this; I was furious. So I took my ax from her back and grabbed her by the hair. I dragged her to the window of her room and opened it. I then picked her up easily as she was extremely light and threw her from the window which was on the fourth floor. She was destroyed on impact and glee filled my soul once again! But, I wasn't done. My other cousin… He had to be dealt with. I know what **must** be done.\n\nFebruary 6, 1921 - The Last Stand\nMy mother and remaining cousins are catching on. The fiends know that it is me but of course they know for it was them who started it. But, it is I who will finish it. I know what **must** be done.\n\n**Final Entry, June 30, 1923 - The Emptiness**\nIt has been many months since my deeds. And still after being saved for all this time, I still feel nothing.

Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Misc Fiction.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In a realm where magic suffused the air and the whispers of ancient deities could be heard in the rustling leaves, the realms of Aquaereth and Ignisstan loomed as bastions of contrasting elements. Aquaereth was a land where the waters were as blue as the skies above, and Ignisstan, a land of fire and brimstone, where the sun blazed unforgivingly.\n\nUnlike their neighbors, these realms adhered to a truce, rooted in the belief that harmony could only be achieved by respecting the natural order. Aquaereth worshipped Solara, the goddess of the sun, while Ignisstan revered Nocturne, the lord of the moon. An ancient prophecy spoke of a cataclysmic clash between these two domains, triggered by an astronomical event of cosmic significance: the convergence of a solar eclipse.\n\nOn this fateful day, the skies darkened, the sun obscured by the moon's shadow. The priesthood of Ignisstan proclaimed this as a celestial omen, a moment when Solara's light would be eclipsed, and Nocturne's dominion would prevail. The king of Ignisstan, driven by fervent belief and the echoes of the prophecy, decreed this day as the moment of their divine crusade.\n\nThe battlefield was set in a realm between the two lands, a neutral ground divided into a grid of 64 squares, echoing the ancient board game said to symbolize the cosmos itself. Each side, Aquaereth and Ignisstan, brought forth their army: 16 pieces including a king, queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns, arranged on their respective sides of the grid.\n\nKing Alderich of Aquaereth, robed in armor as radiant as the dawn, addressed his troops:\n\n\"Today, we stand not merely to defend our honor and our land, but to affirm our faith in Solara. This shadow will pass, and her light will reign supreme. Let us fight with courage, for our gods fight beside us.\"\n\nConversely, High Priest Orin of Ignisstan, his robes shrouded in the veil of the night, rallied his army with a fervor that mirrored the flames of his land:\n\n\"Soldiers of Ignisstan, today the moon casts her shadow over the sun. This is the hour foretold by the ancients. We fight not only for our realm but for the ascendancy of Nocturne. Let the heavens bear witness to our devotion and might!\"\n\nWith these words, the air crackled with the tension of impending conflict. The first pawn from Aquaereth, advancing from e2 to e4, broke the stillness. Ignisstan’s counterpart mirrored the move, and the board came alive with the calculated dance of war.\n\nThe knights charged, the bishops soared across the board's expanse, and the rooks rolled like thunder down their respective ranks. Pawns fell, some in calculated sacrifice, others in the chaos of battle, each death a whisper in the ears of their gods.\n\nQueen Elara of Aquaereth, her presence as commanding as the sea, moved with purpose, shielding her king, supporting her knights, and striking at the heart of Ignisstan's阵容. The high priest, Orin, retreated, his faith tested as the board turned against him.\n\nIn a climactic move, Queen Elara positioned herself at h5, her sword指向 the retreating Orin, as the eclipse began to wane. The light of Solara, once obscured, now shone with renewed vigor. King Alderich, seeing the celestial shift, smiled.\n\n\"Let this be the end of our conflict,\" he proclaimed, his voice carrying the weight of a ruler and a believer.\n\nHigh Priest Orin, unable to bear the sight of his god's shadow receding and his kingdom's loss, reached into his robe and pulled forth a small vial, filled with a substance that glowed with an eerie light. Swallowing it, he fell to the ground, a final act of devotion that silenced the board and the battle.\n\nThe truce between Aquaereth and Ignisstan was rekindled, the gods' contest carried out on the mortal chessboard settling, for now, into a cautious peace. The realms understood that not all conflicts need be fought, and that sometimes, the greatest victories are those that are never realized in battle.\n\nAnd so, in the story of Aquaereth and Ignisstan, the tale echoed the wisdom of the ancient sages: the greatest war is the one never fought, for it is the war where wisdom, faith, and harmony prevail over destruction and despair.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text does capture the distinct writing voice and intricate stylistic nuances of the reference story to a large extent.

{"id": "text_completion_051", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Thriller\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: I\n\nFriday night. The moon was full. An enormous bonfire burned in the Leonard family's backyard and flooded the crisp and clean November air with thick smoke. About 25 party guests formed a circle around it.\nWesley Mason sat cross-legged on the lawn. He watched as the others danced and laughed together. Getting invited to Mia Leonard's house felt like a grand mistake. Wesley showed up at school earlier in the week and found an envelope taped to his locker—just as he'd seen on several other lockers over his four years at Twin Oaks High. He assumed it was someone else's. Nope. Mia wrote his name on it in her signature brand of loopy cursive.\nWesley tugged on the tail of his baggy white polo. His palms were moist and clammy, so he wiped them on his wide chest to dry them. He thought of ways he could join the circle without hassle. An introduction seemed too formal for a bonfire. Jokes went over well for most people, but he didn't know any good ones. He considered walking over and complimenting Mia on her hosting prowess, but the thought of speaking out of turn upset his stomach.\nHe waited for someone to notice him. Twenty minutes passed before Mitch Caldwell tapped him on the shoulder.\n\"Having fun?\"\nWesley turned and looked up at Mitch, who was everything Wesley wasn't: thin, fresh-faced, and confident. They shared a few classes and were friendly. Wesley nodded and flashed a pathetic smile. Mitch dropped to the ground and sat next to Wesley. They watched the bonfire together. The burnt firewood smell filled their noses.\n\"I hate parties,\" Mitch said.\n\"No one's ever invited me to one before.\"\n\"It won't get more exciting than this.\"\n\"How do you know?\"\n\"You'll realize there's not an interesting or original thought among them. They're like one big hive mind and Mia's the queen.\"\n\"I don't think they're that bad,\" Wesley said, just above a whisper. The thought hung in his mind for a moment. Before the party, Wesley couldn't imagine saying anything complementary about someone like Brett Bass, who spent most of his time embarrassing him for a quick and easy laugh. Wesley's sentiment changed when the football star embraced him and said he was happy to see him the moment he arrived at Mia's party.\nThe gesture didn't make sense to Wesley. It didn't matter. He took the good and sprinted with it.\n\"There are worse people,\" Mitch said. Neo-Nazis, anti-vaxxers, Cardinals fans … you name it. The worst thing about the Bonfire Buddies is that they're so boring.\"\n\"If that's how you feel,\" Wesley said, \"then why'd you come?\"\nMitch pursed his lips and thought of a response. A beat passed. He shrugged.\n\"I guess I like to be proven wrong now and then,\" Mitch said. \"Maybe I am wrong and just don't realize it yet. Mia's been hosting these full moon parties since freshman year and more people come every time.\"\n\"And they keep coming back, too.\"\n\"Yeah. Maybe I'm the weird one.\"\n\"I don't think you're weird.\"\n\"Thanks, man.\"\nMitch turned to face the fire. Wesley did the same. They sat in silence and listened to the sounds of the party until a voice called for attention, bringing an end to the music and lively chatter.\nAll eyes around the bonfire turned toward the sprawling Leonard mansion. Wesley and Mitch followed suit and looked over their shoulders. Mia Leonard stood on the second-floor balcony.\nThe right corner of her mouth curled into a half-smile as she waved to her guests.\n\"Hi friends,\" Mia said. \"As many of you might have noticed, we've got two fresh faces joining us tonight. I'm happy to have them here. Are you?\"\n\"We're happy to have you here,\" said the others in unison.\nMitch leaned in toward Wesley and whispered. \"See what I mean? Hive mind.\"\nMia cleared her throat. \"Before we can have a good time with our new friends, we've got to welcome them into our little circle. It's time to head to the rock.\"\nThe others clapped and cheered as if Mia announced they were going to Disneyland on her family's dime.\nII\nTucked away in the woods stretching far beyond the house, the rock sat at the center of a gigantic crater. It was almond-shaped and was the same size as a four-door sedan. Charred remnants of felled trees surrounded the big hole in the ground. Mia Leonard stood at the crater's edge, with the rock serving as an out-of-this world backdrop. Wesley and Mitch stood opposite of her while the others formed a semi-circle behind them.\nThe moon looked big enough to reach up and touch. Its pale glow hung over Mia like a Broadway spotlight.\n\"The locals say it fell from the sky in the early 1900s,\" she said to Wesley and Mitch. \"That's around the time when my family first moved to Twin Oaks and bought the land where the house is. Gramps always called this our family's good luck charm. I believe him. I've seen it work.\"\nUnlike Mia, whose doe eyes and expressive face accented her words, the semi-circle remained stoic during her spiel. They were of one mind and one body. Wesley turned to look behind him. He could see the bonfire smoke in the distance, dissipating above the tall trees. He rubbed the goosebumps on his arms. The chill was getting to him.\n\"Although if we're being honest, it's not ‘luck' that's at play here,\" Mia said. \"This is about enlightenment. This rock isn't just a rock. It links us to a world light-years away from here. A world far more advanced than we'll ever know. All of us here are enlightened. And now, my dear, new friends, you'll can join us and reap the benefits.\"\nThe others spoke in unison. \"Welcome them, Xandu!\"\nWesley glanced at Mitch and raised an eyebrow, as if to ask, \"What the hell is she talking about?\" Mitch shrugged.\nMia turned to her right and motioned for Andie Randall to step forward. Andie did as she was told. She held two red plastic cups in both hands and gave them to Mia before returning to her spot in the semi-circle. Mia approached Wesley and smiled. His face turned crimson, and he looked at his dirty white sneakers in the grass.\n\"Why'd you come here tonight, Wesley?\"\n\"Because you invited me,\" he said. The words fell out of his mouth and dropped to the ground. Mia stood close enough for him to smell her body mist. The same tropical scent lingered on the party invitation taped to his locker.\n\"You came all the way out here and spend time with a bunch of people who don't know you,\" she said. \"Why?\"\nWesley made eye contact with Mia. Her hair wafted in the gentle breeze. The clouds in his head trickled into his stomach and solidified, weighing him down. He spoke louder than the first time. He could see his breath as he talked.\n\"I guess … I guess I just wanted you to like me. No one's ever liked me.\"\nMia handed Wesley a cup and touched his shoulder. \"I'm glad you're here,\" she cooed. \"We're going to be good friends. Trust me. Xandu brought you here for a reason.\"\n\"Thank you, Xandu!\" said the others.\nWesley scratched his head with his free hand. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Xandu chose you to be here. This is the way it's supposed to be.\"\n\"Who is Xandu?\" Wesley didn't want to ask, even though the question sat near the front of his mind.\n\"He's our friend,\" Mia said. \"From another universe. This meteorite is a gift from his planet. It connects us to him. He's so far away, but yet he feels so close. Especially on nights when the moon is full.\"\nWesley's mouth went dry as his head filled with thoughts. Everything he wanted to say jumbled together and melted into a lukewarm soup. The most basic explanation for his state of mind was a sense of low-grade bewilderment. He couldn't fathom that Mia Leonard and the rest of the Bonfire Buddies believed this stuff. The leaves on the trees rustled back and forth. Wesley hoped it was the sound of someone lying in wait, preparing to bust out and tell him it was all a joke. It was only the wind. This was real life, and Wesley had no choice but to accept it.\nHe stood in silence as Mia turned to Mitch, who rolled his eyes as Mia studied him from top-to-bottom.\n\"What about you?\" she said. \"What brought you here, Mitch?\"\n\"I was bored,\" Mitch said. \"Now I'm just confused and concerned about everyone's mental well-being.\"\n\"It'll make sense soon,\" Mia said. She offered the second cup to Mitch. \"Drink this.\"\n\"I only drink Pepsi.\"\n\"This is much better than Pepsi.\"\n\"Hard to believe.\"\nWesley peered inside of his cup and realized the liquid inside had a faint green glow.\n\"What is this?\" he asked Mia.\n\"It'll lower your inhibitions and worries,\" Mia said. \"Having an open mind is important.\"\n\"It's booze,\" Mitch said. \"That's what booze does.\"\n\"Not exactly,\" Mia said.\nWesley did as Mia said and drank. He smacked his lips. The glowing green liquid tasted sweet. Mia covered her mouth with her hand, trying to conceal her laughter at the boy's reaction.\n\"Your turn, Mitch.\"\n\"I'm good.\" Mitch tried to give the cup back to Mia. She wouldn't take it.\n\"The Welcoming has started. Drink.\"\n\"I don't want to be welcomed.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I don't want to be part of your weird little after-school club.\"\n\"You don't believe me,\" she said.\n\"Of course not.\"\n\"I understand,\" Mia nodded. \"I was the same way at first. Very close-minded about the universe and all it inhabits. That changed when a strong, pulsating sensation woke me up one night. I thought it was nothing at first and went back to sleep. Then I felt it again. Then I couldn't stop feeling it. I asked my mom and dad if they felt it, too. They just looked at me as if I was crazy. I thought I was. I went searching for the source one night. The pulse got stronger the more I inched toward the woods. It led me to the rock. It was glowing green when I found it.\"\nMia took the cup from Mitch and raised it to the night sky.\n\"It excreted this liquid from its pores. It was gross. It freaked me out. It was something out of a sci-fi movie. Before I could run and tell someone, I heard a voice call my name. It was the sweetest voice I'd ever heard. I turned back around and faced the glowing rock. The voice told me to drink the liquid. I tried to leave, but I couldn't. So, I did what the voice said and drank. I'd never felt such power course through my body. I wanted more. Before I could get it, the voice told me to bring others into his family. And that's what I've done. I'll never stop doing it. These are my people.\"\n\"Thank you, Xandu!\" said the others.\n\"You managed to convince a bunch of other delusional weirdos to come play in the woods with you,\" Mitch scoffed.\n\"Xandu warned me that you'd be skeptical,\" Mia said. \"He said it's in your nature. We'll fix that, soon.\"\nMitch opened his mouth to speak, but stopped once he noticed Wesley had dropped his plastic cup. Green rock juice spilled onto the grass. Mitch tapped him on the shoulder.\n\"What's wrong with you?\"\nWesley didn't respond. He stared into the distance with vacant eyes. Mitch shook Wesley's shoulder. Still no response. He shook him harder. His eyes grew wider with every passing second, and his mouth hung open. His breathing became shallow and his heartbeat took on a syncopated rhythm.\nHe couldn't move, speak, or think. Then everything went black.\nIII\nWesley collapsed to the ground face-first. He hit the dirt with a forceful thud.\nMitch dropped to his knees and turned the big kid on his back. Wesley's eyes aimed at the sky, staring at nothing in particular. His breathing slowed to a glacial pace.\n\"What the fuck did you do to him?!\"\n\"Don't be scared,\" Mia said. \"This is a good thing. Let the power course through him.\"\nMitch reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell phone. He dialed 911. The call went nowhere. No service.\n\"I'm going to get help,\" Mitch said. \"I'm putting an end to this.\"\nMitch got up and turned to run back toward the house. Brett Bass broke from the semi-circle and stood in his way.\n\"The fuck are you doing?\"\nBrett, tall and broad, didn't answer. He lifted Mitch off the ground and wrapped one arm around his forehead and the other around his neck. He squeezed like a boa constrictor, primed for a kill. Mitch squirmed and clawed and did everything he could to break the grip. No dice. The world around him slipped into an empty void. Breathing became a chore and his body couldn't fight anymore. He heard Mia's voice echo in the distance.\n\"Let him go, Brett.\"\nBrett did as he was told. Mitch fell to the ground and coughed, sucking in as much air as he could to feel alive again. When his vision returned, Mitch looked up at Mia. He felt small, and she looked massive. Her eyes were different. They glowed green. He looked at the others. Their eyes were bright green, too. They outnumbered Mitch. Terror struck his brain and buzzed with the intensity of an agitated wasp's nest. It made him nauseous. He wanted to speak, but he feared he'd projectile vomit the moment he opened his mouth.\n\"Now, do you believe me?\" Mia said.\n\"Please,\" Mitch wheezed. \"Wesley needs help. I need to call for help.\"\n\"He's not in pain. This is a natural part of The Welcoming. It's hard to explain, but think of it like this: If the rock is a link to a world light-years away from here, drinking the juice links us to it. It courses through the body and makes us one with Xandu. Once you are welcomed, you can never break the link. We're forever connected.\"\n\"What is Xandu? Why do you want to be linked with him?\"\n\"Xandu is going to rule this planet one day. We don't know when, but it will happen. At night, I have dreams. I see attack ships breaking through the Earth's atmosphere and landing in every major city. I see a massacre. People eradicated by the millions. Humanity will be extinct, except for us. Xandu's chosen family.\"\n\"You think he won't kill you too? How can you know for sure?\"\n\"We don't know. It's just what we believe.\"\n\"I don't want any part of it.\"\n\"That's your choice. But understand, you won't be able to leave this place and return to your normal life. You can never go back.\"\n\"Are you going to kill me?\"\n\"To go back to society with knowledge of Xandu's existence is impossible.\"\n\"You're going to kill me. I wish you'd say it instead of this cryptic bullshit.\"\n\"I'm sorry. It's what Xandu wants.\"\nMia touched Mitch's shoulder. He brushed her hand away.\n\"Friends,\" she said to the semi-circle. \"This was supposed to be a joyous moment. We were supposed to gain two number members for our family. Both hand-picked by Xandu. I don't feel joy. I'm sad about what we must do.\"\nMitch closed his eyes and sighed. His fate was becoming clear. He opened his eyes and scanned the ground for something that could help him make an escape. The boulders and branches looked too unwieldy to use as weapons.\nHis eyes fixated on a sharp piece of mineral laying near Mia's feet. It must've broken off of the rock, he thought.\nThat'll do.\nMitch reached for it, grabbed it, and leapt to his feet. When Brett Bass stepped toward him, he flailed the make-do weapon.\n\"Get the fuck back!\" Mitch screamed.\nBrett and the others obliged him. Mitch looked at Mia and pointed the sharp piece of rock toward her face. Her glowing green eyes showed no fear.\n\"We're getting out here,\" he said. \"Me and Wes. Right now.\"\n\"You'll lose this fight,\" Mia said. \"We both know that.\"\n\"At least I'm fighting.\"\nThe other members of the circle watched as Mitch backed away, jabbing at them. Wesley hadn't gotten off the ground. Mitch groaned. He walked back toward Wesley and tried to help him up. He wouldn't budge.\n\"We don't have time for this, Wes. Get up. Let's go.\"\nWesley didn't move. Mitch pulled harder.\n\"I'm not playing. Get up. Please!\"\nWesley sat up. He looked at Mitch, whose panicked face relaxed with relief upon seeing his eyes weren't green. If they weren't in the middle of a dire situation, he'd give his classmate a hug. Whatever Mia thought was going to happen didn't. Mitch knew they still had a chance as long as they worked together.\n\"What happened?\" Brett said to Mia, speaking out of turn. \"Why didn't it work?\"\n\"He didn't finish his drink,\" Mia said. \"It doesn't take hold unless every drop is consumed.\"\nMitch extended his hand toward Wesley and used his strength to help him back to his feet.\n\"Let's get the hell outta he—\"\nWithout warning, Wesley punched Mitch in the stomach. He heaved and dropped to his knees, letting go of the sharp piece of space rock. The wasps within Mitch's brain went into a frenzy. He couldn't move. He did nothing when Wesley picked up one of the large boulders nearby and slammed it against his head. Blood spurted from the wound and stained Wesley's baggy polo. Mitch tipped over and crumpled to the ground.\nAfter a few finger and leg twitches, he was gone.\nNo one spoke for what felt like an eternity. Mia put both hands on Wesley's shoulders.\n\"Wesley,\" she said. \"Why did you do that?\"\nHe dropped the rock and hyperventilated. He thought his heart would burst from his chest and flop around for the world to see.\n\"I dunno. I dunno,\" he repeated.\n\"Yes, you do. You're not in trouble. Breathe.\"\nHe did as he was told, unbothered by the sight of her glowing eyes.\n\"When I was on the ground, I saw some things. Visions, like the ones you were talking about. I didn't finish the drink, so I guess I snapped out of it. I heard you guys talking and I guess … I guess I didn't want him to leave and tell anyone. You told me I could be part of the group. It feels nice to be part of something.\"\nMia's mouth curled into a half-smile. She looked at the stars. \"Welcome him, Xandu!\"\nThe others followed her lead.

The autumn breeze carried the scent of decaying leaves as senior students gathered around a raging bonfire in the school's backyard. This was no ordinary party; it was an invitation-only event hosted by the enigmatic and popular senior, Harriet Linton. Known to her friends as Harry, she was the epitome of mysterious elegance, her green eyes mirroring the flickering flames of the fire.\n\nWes Carter, a shy and introverted student, sat on the grass, his hands wrapped around a warm cup of cider. The party was in full swing, but Wes felt detached, observing the laughter and camaraderie from a distance. He’d always been an outsider, and tonight was no different. His gaze fell upon a familiar figure, striding towards him.\n\n“Having fun?” the voice asked.\n\nWes turned to see Oliver Reed, a senior and member of the football team. Confident and handsome, Oliver was everything Wes wasn’t. They’d shared a few classes and were on nodding terms, but they’d never been close. Oliver sat down beside him, and they watched the fire in silence.\n\n“I’m not sure what I’m doing here,” Wes admitted. “I didn’t think people like me got invited to parties like this.”\n\nOliver chuckled, “Neither did I, to be honest. But Harry’s got a way of bringing people together.”\n\nAs they talked, Wes couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy. Oliver fit in so seamlessly, while Wes felt like an outsider looking in. But then, Harry approached them, her expression serious.\n\n“Wes, Oliver, there’s something you need to see.”\n\nShe led them away from the bonfire, into the dense woods that surrounded the school. The air was heavy with the scent of pine and earth. They arrived at an ancient, towering tree, its roots entwined with those of its neighbors. At its base lay a large, misshapen stone, glowing faintly in the moonlight.\n\n“This is the Heart of Pine Valley,” Harry explained. “Legend has it that it fell from the sky centuries ago, during a meteor shower. My family has protected it for generations.”\n\nOliver and Wes exchanged skeptical glances, but Harry’s voice held a note of sincerity. She poured them each a cup of a strange, green liquid from a flask she’d been carrying.\n\n“Drink,” she commanded. “It’s a traditional ritual. It opens your mind.”\n\nWes hesitated, but Oliver took his cup and downed it in one go. The liquid was sweet and warm, tingling down his throat. Harry smiled in approval and handed him the flask. Wes took a small sip, the liquid burning his throat as it went down. Immediately, he felt a sharp pain in his head, followed by a warm buzz that spread through his body. His vision blurred, and he saw visions of faces, both familiar and unknown, flickering in the darkness.\n\nII\n\nThe ground beneath Wes’s feet seemed to give way, and he found himself lying on the forest floor, the moon overhead like a giant, glowing eye. His breath came in ragged gasps, and his heart pounded in his chest.\n\n“Wes, can you hear me?”\n\nOliver’s concerned face hovered above him, and Wes sat up, rubbing his temples. He felt disoriented, but alive. Harry knelt beside him, her eyes still glowing faintly.\n\n“What… what happened?”\n\n“You collapsed,” Oliver said. “We need to get you back to the party.”\n\nBut Harry shook her head. “No, we need to go deeper into the woods. The Heart of Pine Valley is calling to you.”\n\nShe led them further into the darkness, the cold night air sending shivers down their spines. They arrived at a secluded glade, a clearing bathed in moonlight. In the center stood a circle of stones, each etched with ancient symbols.\n\n“This is a sacred place,” Harry explained. “It’s where we connect with the energies of the Heart of Pine Valley.”\n\nShe placed her palms on the ground and began to chant, a low, rhythmic hum that seemed to vibrate through the earth itself. Oliver and Wes exchanged nervous glances, but they both placed their hands on the ground as well, feeling the energy coursing through them.\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, its form indistinct in the moonlight. It floated towards them, its voice a soft whisper in Wes’s ear.\n\n“Welcome,” it said. “You have been chosen.”\n\nWes’s blood turned to ice. He recognized the voice, though he couldn’t place it. The figure’s presence was overwhelming, and he felt a compulsion to obey its commands.\n\n“Who… who are you?” he stammered.\n\n“I am the Guardian of Pine Valley. The Heart of Pine Valley has chosen you for a great purpose. You must become its protectors.”\n\nHarry and Oliver both nodded in agreement, their faces alight with awe. Wes felt a mixture of fear and excitement. He’d always longed for a sense of purpose, and here it was, presented to him on a silver platter. But the Guardian’s presence was unnerving, and he knew this was no ordinary evening.\n\nIII\n\nAs they made their way back to the party, the three friends couldn’t stop talking about what they’d experienced. The bonfire was still raging when they arrived, and Harry called everyone together.\n\n“We’ve been chosen,” she announced. “Chosen to protect the Heart of Pine Valley. It’s a great honor, but it comes with great responsibility.”\n\nThe crowd murmured in excitement, their faces alight with wonder. Harry’s words were like a spell, casting a sense of purpose over the group. Wes looked around, realizing that this was where he belonged all along. He felt a sense of belonging he’d never felt before.\n\nBut then, a voice cut through the night air, sharp and clear.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\nOliver turned to see Jordan Williams, another senior and rival of Oliver’s, striding towards them. He was accompanied by a few of his friends, their faces flushed with drink.\n\n“This is private, Jordan,” Oliver said.\n\n“Private?” Jordan sneered. “This is my party. You’re not invited.”\n\nOliver stepped forward, but Harry held up her hand. “Jordan, listen. We’re doing something important here. Something that matters.”\n\nJordan laughed, but his eyes were filled with malice. “Important? You’re just a bunch of weirdos doing some kind of cult thing.”\n\nHe gestured to his friends, and they surged forward, their faces twisted with scorn. Oliver and Wes stood their ground, but the situation quickly escalated into chaos. Jordan and his friends started throwing punches, and the bonfire was extinguished in the melee.\n\nIn the chaos, Wes saw a figure lurking in the shadows, watching them with a predatory gleam in its eyes. It was the Guardian, and it was smiling.\n\nIV\n\nThe aftermath was a mess of bruised egos and shattered dreams. Oliver and Wes found themselves huddled together in the woods, their breaths coming in short, shallow gasps.\n\n“We can’t let them win,” Oliver said, his voice filled with determination.\n\nWes nodded, his mind still reeling from everything that had happened. He felt a sense of purpose, but also a deep-seated fear. The Guardian’s presence was unsettling, and he wasn’t sure he was ready for what lay ahead.\n\nBut then, the Guardian reappeared, its form more defined in the moonlight.\n\n“You have been chosen,” it said again. “You must protect the Heart of Pine Valley. The forces of darkness are closing in, and only you can stop them.”\n\nOliver and Wes felt a surge of energy, a sense of purpose that filled them to the brink of bursting. The Guardian was right; they had been chosen. And they would protect the Heart of Pine Valley, no matter the cost. The night air was filled with the sounds of battle, but the two friends felt a sense of calm, knowing they were on the right path.\n\nIn the distance, the full moon glowed like a giant, glowing eye, watching over them as they embarked on their noble quest.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the tone and style of the reference story to a significant extent, maintaining the same mysterious and eerie atmosphere.

{"id": "text_completion_052", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Horror\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a first-grade teacher and I'm facing a situation that's left me really unsettled. I recently gave my class an assignment to write a short essay about what their parents do for a living. It's usually a fun exercise with kids talking about their parents being doctors, firefighters, construction workers, etc. But this time, I received an essay from one of my students that has me genuinely worried. Let's call him Timmy.\n\nA bit of context: This boy is somewhat of an enigma. He's the only student in my class whose parents have never shown up for any school events or parent-teacher conferences. Whenever I've asked about his family, he clams up and refuses to give me any details about his father's name or their address. It's odd, but I never pressed too hard, thinking there might be personal issues at play.\n\nAnyway, here's the essay he handed in. Keep in mind, it's written by a first-grader, so the language is simple and innocent. But the content… well, read for yourself:\n\nMy Dad's Job by Timmy\n\nMy dad has a really cool job. He helps people sleep! It's super important because everyone needs sleep to feel good and strong. My dad is very good at his job, and he works at night when it's very quiet. He says that there are people living in his head who tell him what to do, and that they know best. They say that people don't sleep enough, and that somebody should help people fall asleep.\n\nMy dad has lots of shiny tools that he uses for his job. Some of them are sharp, like the ones we see in the kitchen, but they are special because they help him do his job perfectly. He has big shiny knives, tiny pointy things, and sometimes he uses ropes. He keeps them all very clean and shiny, and I think they look really cool.\n\nDad has a special room where he does his job. It has drawers and tables for the tools and a special chair where the people he helps have to sit down. It has special belts that help them keep still. He says that it helps them fall asleep faster.\n\nWhen my dad helps people sleep, sometimes there is a lot of red juice. He says it's the same kind of red juice as the one that comes out of my knee when I fall from my bike. I don't know why there is so much red juice, but my dad says it's normal and that it means he is doing a good job. The red juice can get everywhere, and it's a little messy, but my dad always cleans up really well. He doesn't like to leave any mess behind. He even has a special white suit and mask to stop the juice from getting on his clothes.\n\nSometimes, people don't want to sleep and they scream and cry. Like my little sister who has an earlier bedtime than me but always wants to stay up later! My dad says they are just scared because they don't know how much better they will feel after they sleep. He tries to help them calm down, but it can be hard. My dad is very patient and tries his best to help everyone. He told me that he puts them in black bags and puts them underground to help them sleep better. He regularly drives very far to find a quiet place and digs deep holes there to put the people in black bags in. I think that's very kind of him because it means they can sleep without any noise or disturbances.\n\nMy dad also plays games with the police. It sounds like a lot of fun! He calls it hide and seek. The police try to find him, but he is very good at hiding. He hides so well that the police can't catch him. My dad says the detectives have a lot of fun trying to find him, and he likes to send them funny letters to keep the game going. He even sends letters to the newspapers to make people laugh.\n\nOne time, my dad showed me a letter he sent to a newspaper. It had lots of funny pictures and words, and I think it made a lot of people smile. He is very good at drawing and writing, and he always makes his letters very interesting.\n\nMy dad says he is not allowed to use his real name for his job. It's part of the game's rules and makes it more fun. He uses a special secret nickname to sign his letters.\n\nMy dad's job is really exciting, and I'm proud of him. He works very hard to help people sleep and makes sure they are comfortable. Even though some people might be scared, my dad always knows what to do. He is the best at playing hide and seek with the police and making everyone laugh with his letters.\n\nLast week, he told me that the police had to make the rules harder because he's so good at the game. The police told people through the newspaper that they aren't allowed to walk alone at night and should call 9-1-1 when they see him. I think it's cheating and really unfair. But he says that it just makes the game more fun.\n\nI love my dad and think he has the best job ever. He is always there to help people when they need to sleep and makes sure everything is just right. I want to be just like him when I grow up and help people too.\n\nShould I contact the authorities or am I overreacting? I'm genuinely at a loss here and could use some advice. I'm seriously worried about the boy and I can't think of any normal job that fits this description. But it could also be just a very vivid imagination.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Unlike Timmy's account, Lily’s story whispers of terror, not tranquility. \n\nLily's words were etched into my mind, her voice trembling as she described her father's peculiar occupation. “My dad has a really spooky job,” she began, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and fear. “He helps people sleep, but not the way you think.” \n\nHer father, a silhouette of mystery, worked under the cloak of night, where whispers caressed the still air, and the moon's glow served as a sinister spotlight. “He says there are whispering voices in his head,” Lily confided, “but they aren't kind. They command him, telling him what to do, where to go.” \n\nThe tools of his trade were not the mundane knives and ropes of a kitchen or a garage, but sharp, gleaming instruments that glistened malevolently under the moon’s gaze. “They’re special,” she explained, her voice quivering, “different from the ones we use for playing or eating.” \n\nHis workspace was no ordinary room; it was a chamber shrouded in secrecy, filled with drawers containing his spectral arsenal, a chair for the unwilling participants, and belts to restrain them. “The belts are to keep them still,” Lily whispered, “so they don't wake up.” \n\nThe red juice that stained the floor and walls was not the innocent blood of minor injuries, but a harrowing symbol of his gruesome duty. “My dad says it's normal,” Lily said, her young eyes clouded with confusion and dread, “but it worries me. He cleans it all up, so it doesn’t look messy, but I can still see it in his eyes.” \n\nNot all who encountered her father’s ministrations were willing. Some screamed, cried, pleaded to be released from the clutches of slumber. “My dad says they’re scared because they don't know how much better they’ll feel after they sleep,” Lily relayed, her voice tinged with sorrow. “But I think they’re scared because they know they’ll never wake up.” \n\nFor those who resisted, her father devised a chilling solution. “He puts them in black bags and buries them deep underground,” Lily revealed, her breath catching in her throat. “He finds quiet places, far from prying eyes, and digs deep holes.” \n\nLily's father, a master of deception, played a game with the police, a twisted version of hide and seek. “The police try to catch him,” she explained, “but he’s very good at hiding.” But this game was no mere pastime; it was a dance of cat and mouse, one that left a trail of fear and uncertainty in its wake.\n\nHis letters, once a source of amusement, now read like ominous threats. “He sends funny pictures and words,” Lily said, her voice falling to a hollow whisper, “but they’re terrifying.” The police, once amused by his antics, grew weary of his games, imposing stricter rules to curb his insidious play. “Now they aren't allowed to walk alone at night, and they have to call 9-1-1 if they see him,” Lily concluded, her expression one of dismay.\n\nShould I heed Lily’s words and alert the authorities? Or am I, too, caught in the grip of a fevered imagination? The line between reality and nightmare blurs with each retelling of her father's disturbing duties. But one thing is certain: Lily’s story, though wrapped in the innocence of a child’s voice, echoes with the chilling cadence of true horror.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the writing voice and stylistic nuances of the preceding text quite well, maintaining a consistent tone and emotional resonance throughout.

{"id": "text_completion_053", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Science Fiction\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: No one paid any attention to the ragged old man on his hands and knees vomiting in a corner of one of the numerous dark corridors of the Dredges. If they had, they may have noticed that he wasn't so old, perhaps in his mid-thirties, and that he wore the stained and faded uniform of a vice captain of the Inter-Solar Exploration Agency beneath his tattered long coat. But his unkempt hair and over-grown beard, along with the condition of his clothing gave off the impression of both old age and bitter hardship, so no one bothered to take further note of him.\n\nGregor Thames picked himself up off the ground slowly, the churning in his stomach subsiding for the time being. He slowly made his way down the poorly lit hall, using the metallic wall to support his trembling legs while trying to avoid stepping on the other denizens that lay slumped over on the floor. They were either in the throes of a drug-induced paralysis, the welcome abyss of sleep, or dead. Here in the Dredges, deep in the bowels of Salvation, life was about oblivion, and whatever brought it on was far better than the cold reality of the waking world.\n\nAs he stumbled along, Gregor couldn't help letting his mind wander back to his past. Indeed, it was due to his past that his mind would often take off on its own, to times when his name and position had meant something more.\n\nHe was one of the first explorers to ever cross the Outer Quadrant, beyond Pluto, reaching into the darkness of Void space to find what lay beyond the solar system. He had been an ace pilot, able to skim through the Void with the ease of one born for the task. He had earned commendations and medals, exalting his bravery and dedication to the furtherance of mankind's ambitions.\n\nThat last thought made him angry. All the medals in the known galaxy wouldn't do him the least bit of good now. He, like so many before, had become addicted to Irellium-9, the drug required for quantum-space travel. Without it, humans would go mad in the Void, their brains unable to process the absence of time. After so long, the mind became so dependent upon the drug that without it, a person's perspective would become permanently altered. It would sometimes take seemingly hours for a drop of water to fall from a leaky faucet into the bottom of a sink. At other times, days would pass in the blink of an eye, and the one experiencing it would sometimes die of dehydration without even realizing it.\n\nAfter his symptoms became too evident to hide anymore, the Exploration Agency hadthanked him for his service and discharged him with a moderate severance. The credits spent faster than he imagined they would, and before long he was homeless and wandering around Salvation, doing odd jobs that didn't pay much, but allowed him to purchase black market rations of I-9. As the months rolled by, his condition grew worse, so much so that those that had been willing to offer him work finally began turning him away. He had turned to theft, robbery and at times, murder, to acquire the drug he needed.\n\nHe had been without it for days now, if his mind could be trusted (it couldn't), and his withdrawal symptoms were reaching an unbearable state. He was out of money, and here in the foul Dredges no one had anything worth stealing. He was going to have to make his way up to one of the main decks to see if he could find any way of obtaining more I-9.\n\nHe worked his way up the various corridors and stairwells till he reached the sub-level of the cargo deck. His stomach had begun churning again, and time distortions were threatening to overtake his mind, so he moved as fast as he dared, lifting a deck plate and climbing out onto the loading floor before anyone could notice him. Staying out of sight behind the various shipping containers and storage units, he snuck around to where he knew ships would be offloading illegal cargo to sell to the highest bidder. He had to be careful; these were pirates and smugglers. They'd kill him without hesitation if they caught him trying to steal from them.\n\nStepping behind a stack of metal crates he almost ran directly into a tall man wearing what appeared to be an exo-suit. He began to stammer drunkenly about being lost, in the hopes this stranger wouldn't decide to end his life right there and then, when the man shushed him and pulled him in close to the crates.\n\n\"Who are you?\" The man asked, his voice somewhat muffled by the breather on the exo-suit's mask.\n\n\"My name's Jon.\" Gregor lied. \"I was just lookin' for a place to sleep.\"\n\n\"Well, Jon, this looks like it might be your lucky day.\" The muffled voice replied. \"I need some help, and by the looks of you, you need a fix. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.\"\n\nGregor tried to back away, not wanting to have anything to do with whatever this guy planned, when the man reached into a pouch at his waist and pulled out a hypo-pak. Gregor's heart almost leapt from his chest. It was I-9!\n\nHe instinctively reached for it, and the man pulled it back away. \"First, you help me. Then, I'll see to it you have enough of this to last you a long time.\" He said, wiggling the pak between two fingers.\n\nIt only took a second for Gregor to make up his mind. He nodded at the man in agreement.\n\nThe figure in the mask nodded back, and then turned his attention back to the storage units. \"See that unit there, number four-twenty-one?\" He asked. Gregor peeked around the stranger's shoulder at the small building. It looked to be about ten meters square with a typical coded lock door. Two men armed with plasma rifles stood next to the door, talking quietly while casting searching glances around the dock.\n\n\"I need to get inside that unit, and to do that I'm going to need a diversion to get those guards away from the door.\" The man said. He turned back to look at Gregor. \"Jon, I need you to set a charge back towards the loading area. The explosion should get their attention long enough to let me get past that door.\"\n\n\"How are you going to get past that lock?\" Gregor asked. \"Those aren't easy to bypass.\" He should know, he'd tried several times to get into a storage unit in this area, and had never been successful.\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" The man replied, \"just take this and set it off where I told you.\" He handed Gregor a small pulse charge, nothing that would cause much damage on its own, but would make a loud enough noise to bring the whole dock running to see what had happened.\n\n\"How am I supposed to get away when they come looking?\" Gregor asked. He wasn't comfortable about being someone's stooge.\n\n\"You look resourceful. You'll figure out something.\" The man said. \"When you get clear, meet me back here and I'll make good on my word. Now go!\"\n\nGregor hesitated for a moment, then started making his way back toward the loading areas. He felt queasy about this whole deal, and he was sure it wasn't the withdrawal pains. He didn't even know what this guy looked like under the exo-suit, but the thought of landing a nice stash of I-9 drove him. He hoped the stranger would keep his word and not leave him empty handed.\n\nHe reached the loading area and squatted down behind several skids stacked high with barrels. He fumbled around with the charge, trying to recall his military training on how to set the timer. After a few minutes he managed to get it set for one minute. He set it down behind a barrel and slipped away to find a hiding spot before it went off.\n\nHe had just ducked under a plastic tarp when the charge went off. It was louder than he had expected, and when he heard several more explosions go off he realized something hadn't gone as planned. Peeking out from his hiding spot, he saw the reason for the additional explosions. Apparently, those barrels had contained something volatile, and the charge had ignited them. There was a huge fire burning on the dock, and several people were running around trying to save their goods from the flames. Auto-drones came whizzing in and began spraying flame-suppressing foam on the fire, but it would take some time before they would have it out.\n\nWith everyone distracted by the fire, it seemed like a good time to vacate his hiding spot and make his way back to the stranger. He was able to get back to the storage unit without drawing any undue attention. He saw that the guards had indeed left their post to investigate the disturbance, and the door to the unit was standing open.\n\nHe thought about going back to where he and the stranger had agreed to meet, but curiosity got the better of him and he decided to go have a look at what was worth all this trouble. Looking around to be sure no one was coming, he made his way up to the open door to peer inside. What he saw was the man in the exo-suit loading up a pack with small metal cartons out of a fibresteel crate on the floor. There was nothing else in the room.\n\nHe started to enter the room when the man spun around, a small pistol appearing in his hand from seemingly nowhere. \"Hey!\" Gregor whispered harshly. \"Take it easy, man!\"\n\nThe stranger lowered the pistol. \"I thought I told you to wait for me back behind the crates.\" He said. \"What did you do out there? It sounded like you tried to blow up half the station!\"\n\n\"Hey, I got you your distraction, didn't I?\" Gregor retorted. \"Now give me what you promised, so I can get the hell outta here!\"\n\nThe stranger chuckled through the mask, \"Ok, pal. You're right. Here.\" He tossed one of the small cartons to Gregor. \"Take it easy with that. It's not your average stuff.\"\n\nGregor opened the carton to reveal at least two dozen hypo-paks neatly arranged into three rows. It was easily worth a couple of thousand credits on the market. He'd be set for weeks on this.\n\nHe turned to leave and a voice barked out, \"Who the fuck are you?!\"\n\nThe two guards had returned, and were taking aim at Gregor and the stranger inside the unit. Reflexes took hold and Gregor dived to one side of the door just as plasma bursts came screaming through the doorway. The smell of burnt ozone quickly filled the room as Gregor watched the man in the exo-suit duck behind the crate and begin to fire back.\n\nRealizing that he was most likely about to die, Gregor pulled out one of the hypo-paks. If he was going to be killed, he'd be killed while riding a wave of I-9 to the afterlife. He stuck the needle into the carotid artery just beneath his right ear, closed his eyes, and squeezed the injector. Instantly, the sensation of transcending time and space engulfed him, and his consciousness soared with a euphoria born of the quantum stimulant. It was powerful stuff, like the stranger had said, and his mind reeled at the potency of the drug.\n\nIt was some time before he realized that he could no longer hear the gunfight taking place. He opened his eyes and looked around. What he saw, he simply couldn't believe.\n\nTime had been frozen. Blazing ribbons of plasma energy hung motionless in the air. The combatants were as still as statues, poised in fighting positions on both sides of the doorway. Even the smoke from where the bolts had burned into the walls behind the stranger wasn't drifting away. All around was absolute silence.\n\nGregor had a wild guess of what had happened, but it defied logic. He'd been here countless times, but never like this. Before, he was always at the helm of a ship equipped with a powerful rift drive capable of punching holes in the sub-quantum field and traveling great distances in an instant. Time would stop, and he would be left alone to pilot the ship through the dimensional rift while periodic doses of Irellium-9 were administered by an automated system. Still, even though he lacked a ship, or a rift drive of any sort, he knew where he was.\n\nHe was in the Void.\n\nHe slowly stood up, his mind trying to make sense of what had just happened. It took an enormous amount of energy to open a rift. Yet here he was, outside of time with nothing more than a dose of I-9.\n\nThe drug! He looked at the drained hypo-pak still in his hand, then at the fibresteel crate it had come from. On the side were printed the words:\n\nEXPERIMENTAL USE ONLY\n\nIRELLIUM-13\n\nPROPERTY OF CENTAUR CORP\n\nIrellium-13? What the hell was that? Centaur? That was the biggest pharmaceutical company in the solar system. They had invented I-9 back during the solar expansion. It seemed they had been working on improving their formula. But this? How long was this going to last? Would it be permanent?\n\nGregor shook his head in an attempt to clear it. He was on the verge of a panic attack. He needed to calm down. He walked over to the door and stepped past the two armed men. Walking across the dock was as eerie a sensation as anything he'd ever experienced. The silence was palpable, and the scenery around him was beyond surreal. People were frozen in place, rushing to fight a fire that was unmoving. Waving his hand through the flames he could feel no warmth at all. He walked to the lifts and pressed the call button. Nothing.\n\nHe was wondering what to do about his current situation when a thought occurred to him. He walked back to where the crate containing the Irrellium-13 was located. Taking the pack the stranger had been filling, he emptied the rest of the contents of the crate in the pack and slung it over his shoulder. If and when this stuff did wear off, there was no sense in just leaving it laying around for someone else, he figured. He headed back down into the Dredges with his stolen goods.\n\nThere was no way to tell how long he was under the influence of the drug. Time held no meaning in the Void. He had hidden the pack, and then went around the station, taking food, clothing, and other valuables as he came across them. He even went as far as to give himself a clean shave and trimmed his long hair into a more manageable length. In the back of his mind was the fear that he would never leave the Void, that he was doomed to an eternity of being alone in a dimension where there was no sound, movement, or anything. He tried to keep his mind occupied and not think of it, but it was difficult.\n\nHe was in the process of rummaging through a cabinet of fine wines in the Paramour Club when suddenly it felt like everything shifted. His equilibrium was thrown off and he almost fell down. Suddenly, the air was full of sounds. Music was playing, people were talking, and the smells of cooking food filled his nose. He stepped back away from the cabinet just as a burly man in an apron came through the door of the room he was in.\n\n\"Hey, what are you doing back here?\" The big man demanded.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Gregor apologized, \"I was trying to find the restrooms.\"\n\nThe man fixed him with a suspicious look. \"Well, they're not in here. Get out!\"\n\nAs Gregor left the club, he stopped and reconsidered his situation. He now knew the effects of the drug weren't permanent. Relief washed over him, and at the same time the knowledge struck him as unbelievably humorous. He could escape time at will! He began laughing, first to himself, then out loud. Passers-by gave him odd looks, but he didn't care. He could do anything he wanted! Anything!\n\nHe walked along, still laughing at his fortune. Salvation station, hell, the entire solar system, was his for the taking!\n\n*\n\nIn an opulent office, high up in a skyscraper overlooking Mars City, a meeting was taking place between two powerful men.\n\n\"Mr. Lions, I assure you that the agent we sent was of the highest caliber. If I held any doubt of his skills, I would never have sent him.\" Said the first, a younger man in his late twenties with short dark hair and wearing an expensive suit.\n\n\"I believe you, Mr. Drake, but nonetheless, the samples are missing, your man is dead, and I am at a loss of approximately two and a half million credits. This must be rectified.\" Replied Mr. Lions, a gentleman whom most would consider being in his late sixties, but in fact was much older. He wore an even more expensive suit of clothes. \"I've had reports that at the time of the gunfight between your man and the smugglers, several people on the station noticed certain items missing. Some items were of value, and some were rather mundane. Though Salvation is well known as a den of thieves, this particular rash of thefts were carried out, in some circumstances, before the very eyes of the victims. One instant the items in question would be there, and the next, they were simply gone. This lends one to the possible conclusion that a third party has become involved, and is using the samples in a most irresponsible way,\" He finished.\n\n\"I've had those same reports, Mr. Lions, and I already have agents scouring the station looking for anyone who may have been in the vicinity of the loading docks at the time of the incident in question.\" Mr. Drake responded. \"Have faith, sir, we will find and deliver your property, as promised.\"\n\nMr. Lions rose from his seat. \"I do hope so, Mr. Drake. I do hope so.\" He turned and began walking toward the door. \"If this person continues to abuse the samples in the same manner they have already demonstrated, we may end up with a much larger problem than we face now. You know of what I speak.\"\n\nMr. Drake waited until his guest had left, and then opened a comm unit on his desk. The holocron display lit up and a dark-skinned man wearing a visor came into view.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Drake?\" The man asked.\n\n\"Leon, we will need to commit more resources to finding the thief. I want two more units dispatched at once to Salvation.\" Mr. Drake ordered.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Leon replied. The holocron blinked out.\n\nMr. Drake sat back in his chair. The situation had spiraled out of control, and now someone had a chemical that was potentially the most dangerous substance in the galaxy. The fool couldn't possibly realize the catastrophe using the Irellium-13 could bring about. If this went wrong, and his and Mr. Lions' worst fears became reality…\n\nHe got up from his desk and walked over to the window overlooking Mars City. Its gleaming lights and towering buildings stretched all the way to the horizon. Millions of citizens lived here in a splendor never thought possible a scant few decades ago. The three mega corporations that had built the Inter-Solar Union were headquartered here. Wealth, power, and ambition radiated from the very streets themselves. It was the shining jewel of the solar system; a living monument to the greatness of all mankind.\n\nAnd one ignorant thief was on the verge of destroying it all without even realizing it.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "Title: **Eclipse of Time**\n\nIn the labyrinthine depths of the Dredges, a shadowy figure moved with the stealth of a specter. His eyes, glinting with an otherworldly hunger, betrayed the desperation that gnawed at his core. His identity concealed beneath a tattered cloak, he was known to few as Emmet Kade, a fallen agent of the Inter-Solar Exploration Agency. Once a celebrated pilot who charted the galaxies, Kade now wielded a different kind of star—a rare chemical concoction known as Quadrantium-X.\n\nHe navigated the dingy corridors, a dance of survival and desperation. The Dredges, deep within the bowels of the station Salvation, were a playground for those who had lost their grip on reality—or had never had it in the first place. Here, time stretched and warped, both a blessing and a curse. With each step, Kade's mind wandered to the golden days of exploration, when he was a beacon of humanity's thirst for the unknown. Medals and commendations, once his pride, now seemed like relics of a life he'd long since outgrown.\n\nFor years, Kade had been consumed by the need for Quadrantium-X, the chemical that allowed pilots to endure the temporal chaos of the Void. Without it, the mind splintered, reality twisted into a nightmarish labyrinth. Yet, as he descended further into its clutches, he found the drug merely a crutch, a false savior for a soul in torment.\n\nHis discharge from the Exploration Agency, while generous in severance, had been swift. As the credits dwindled, so did his hope. Desperation led him into the underbelly of Salvation, a world where life was as fleeting as the shadows it cast. In this realm, Kade became a chameleon, blending into the decay that surrounded him. He resorted to theft, a dance with the devil that offered him a temporary fix for his addiction.\n\nDays had passed since his last dose, and the withdrawal symptoms clawed at his sanity like ravenous beasts. Visions of galaxies merging, time folding upon itself, consumed his every waking moment. The Dredges, usually his sanctuary, now seemed a prison. He needed a way out, a way to satiate his craving without resorting to theft, which had grown increasingly difficult as his reputation spread.\n\nIn the heart of the cargo deck, Kade found his opportunity. The dock was a hive of clandestine activities, where the line between legal and illegal cargo blurred. Here, pirates and smugglers thrived, and Kade intended to be their unsuspecting benefactor.\n\nHe approached a figure cloaked in an exo-suit, a man who moved with the fluidity of someone who had danced with the Void itself. \"I'm in need,\" Kade spoke, his voice a whisper amidst the cacophony of the dock. \"You look like someone who can help.\"\n\nThe figure turned, revealing eyes that held the weight of the cosmos. \"And what makes you think that?\" he asked, his voice muffled by the breather of his mask.\n\n\"It's written on your face, the hunger, the desperation. I've seen it in the reflection of a thousand mirrors,\" Kade replied, his own desperation igniting the spark of mutual understanding.\n\nThe man nodded, reaching into his pouch and producing a hypo-pak. \"You do indeed have a way with words. A talent I find... intriguing. For a price, I can offer you more than just this.\" He gestured towards the hypo-pak, a glimmer of something feral in his eyes.\n\nKade's heart leapt. \"Name your price.\"\n\nThe man's gaze hardened. \"I need access to a storage unit. Number four-twenty-one. The contents are of utmost importance. I require a diversion to get past the guards.\"\n\nIt was a dangerous proposition, but Kade’s desperation outweighed his fear. \"How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?\" he asked, skepticism tingeing his tone.\n\n\"Trust is earned, not given,\" the man responded, a flicker of something that might have been amusement crossing his face. \"But fear not, for you have my word—and my word is my bond.\"\n\nKade nodded, his mind already racing with the possibilities. He accepted the hypo-pak, a promise of the euphoria that awaited him. The man detailed the plan, and Kade set about his task, the chemical burning a hole in his pocket like a siren song.\n\nThe explosion was loud,echoing through the corridors, a symphony of chaos that drew the guards away from their post. Kade made his way back, the adrenaline of his actions mingling with the anticipation of what lay ahead. He arrived to find the storage unit open, the guards nowhere in sight. Inside, the man in the exo-suit was busy transferring crates into a pack.\n\n\"It's done,\" Kade declared, his voice steadier than he felt.\n\nThe man turned, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. \"You returned. I was beginning to doubt my assessment of your resourcefulness.\"\n\nKade couldn't help but smile, the drug already beginning to course through his veins. \"I'm a man of my word.\"\n\nThe man handed him another hypo-pak, the gesture of goodwill. \"And I am a man of mine. This is but a taste of what awaits you if you continue to prove your worth.\"\n\nKade injected the chemical, and the world around him dissolved. Time ceased to exist, a fleeting moment suspended in eternity. He was adrift in a sea of stars, his mind expanding beyond the confines of his body. In this new realm, the future was an open road, paved with possibilities untold.\n\nWhen consciousness returned, Kade found himself alone in the storage unit, the man in the exo-suit gone. The storage unit was empty, save for a single crate addressed to \"Mr. Kade,\" a promise of what was to come. He opened it, revealing rows of hypo-paks, each one a gateway to a world beyond time.\n\nWith the chemical secured, Kade turned his attention to the future. The Dredges had been his sanctuary, but they were no longer his prison. The galaxy lay open before him, a canvas of possibilities painted in the stars. And as he walked away, a new purpose ignited in his soul, a hunger for something greater than the void could ever offer.\n\nIn the high-rises of Mars City, the powers that be watched with growing concern. A thief, a rogue agent, had stumbled upon a chemical that could redefine the fabric of reality itself. As they mobilized their resources to track him down, they whispered of a thief who danced with the void, a man named Emmet Kade, whose journey was just beginning.\n\nThe quest for Quadrantium-X had led Kade down a path of redemption or ruin. As the galaxy watched, the fates of countless lives hung in the balance, a testament to the power of a chemical that could eclipse time itself.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the tone, complexity, and emotional resonance of the reference story quite well, integrating intricate stylistic nuances.

{"id": "text_completion_054", "instruction": "You should write a story on the topic \"Fantasy\" in the style of the following story.\n[Reference Story]: Winter thaws and spring buds through that auspicious Saturday morning. Picture a star student called Foy. The child sees in the news that his idol's starship is a sham, caught instead with lucre in hand. The idol's excuse, \"Fools! Who in their right mind would believe it viable, so do not be surprised at my guile.\" Thinking the news is false, Foy ignores it.\n\nAt breakfast, his mother says, \"There's a bum sleeping on our bench.\" Foy's father gets up from the table to investigate, Foy follows him. On seeing the pair, the vagrant flees. With Foy's help, the father lugs the bench into the garage. The father goes back in alone, leaving the child in the yard.\n\nIsolated now, Foy checks the mail. On opening the mailbox's lid, along with the envelopes and flyers, Foy notices alongside an advertisement, a yellow ticket announcing a spring cruise. The boy pockets the ticket separately. On returning, Foy spots the transient lying behind a neighbor's shrubbery near a conifer.\n\nMinutes later, Foy comes back in and places the mail on the kitchen table. While thinking about telling its parents about the vagrant, the father points to the ticket that fell from Foy's pocket. The father snatches it away and places it in the shredder with its discarded brethren. Throughout, the father complains about paying taxes for this sort of junk to be delivered.\n\nA long night awaits Foy. Hot, the kid opens his window to cool his room. Hours in, the kid falls into slumber. The child awakens on a lifeboat in an unknown sea under a pink sky. A snug sports jacket encloses his chest. A nearby cruise ship sails up, turns and stops close to the kid. Inscribed in gold letters on the ship's bow read Levantic. From the deck, a staff member waves to Foy.\n\nThe staff member calls out, \"Are you interested in a quest?\" When the child refuses, the staff member continues, \"No trust in your heart?\" The staff member throws down a rope ladder. Suddenly, against his best interests, Foy grabs the ladder and climbs up. On the last rung, the crew-mate reaches out his hand to help the kid complete his ascent. Suspicious, Foy waves the offer away to ascend alone.\n\nOnce aboard, the staff member introduces himself as the second mate. He then asks the child for his ticket. Foy panics, remembering his father shredded the ticket. He calms, feeling his ticket, in one piece, in his pocket. Handing the ticket over, the staff member validates it. Once confirmed, the second mate escorts Foy further.\n\nThe second mate gives a brief tour of the ship. He mentions the many gifts that the captain has bestowed upon them. There are many pastimes available to Foy; and, many friends, awaiting Foy's invitation. The only parts of the ship off limits are the captain's chambers and the lower decks, but for all else, Foy is welcome to partake.\n\nWhen the orientation finished, the crewman said, \"Relax until the evening. You're an honored guest.\" Parting ways, the second mate says, \"It's a sight not to miss, and perhaps, one might even glimpse our illustrious captain.\"\n\nThat day, Foy celebrates among the other children with a multitude of wonders: enticing games, simple, dynamic and ready for another member to jump in; refreshments from all corners of the world pleasantly presented; slides through labyrinthine pipes; and, familiar toys with endless new features. Among all these delights, Foy meets a group of well-dressed kids. Their dialogue was witty, their intellect substantial; and, Foy was very pleased to be in their company.\n\nThat evening, there was a grand ceremony on the deck. The passengers participated in a dance. At its conclusion, all the other children tore off fronds from branches of nearby potted trees. They placed the fronds, alongside their jackets, on the ground to form a path. Foy, not wanting to be left out, mimicked their actions.\n\nLater that night, an eclipse of the moon took place, darkening the deck of the ship. This event surprises Foy. When the moonlight and other lights return, his companions exclaim hearing the sounds of clip-clops, the smell of a barn and pine, and the feeling of warmth, yet Foy sensed none of it. When the moment passes, the celebration continues.\n\nOn the way back to his cabin, Foy noticed six bright candles on a table. Between the candles stood vases of multicolored roses arranged in a circle, interspaced among them were depictions of an old woman, a middle-aged man, and a four-eyed child. Finally, Foy sees the silhouette of a man behind the blinds of the captain's chamber window.\n\nLooking back, Foy notices the makeshift path has disappeared. The torn-off fronds were seamlessly reattached to the limbs of the potted plants. For where the jackets went, Foy is left guessing.\n\nOn leaving the deck, Foy overhears the wealthy kids complain about the disturbance, stating that no lunar event was expected. They attribute the moon's absence to passing clouds. To confirm, Foy looks up. A clear starry sky stretches across the horizon. He goes back to his room and finds his lost jacket, neatly folded, on his bed.\n\nOver the following days, a fog spread and deepened. The activities were more constrained. The candles on the captain's table burn out daily; for which, after a few days, only three candles remain. While Foy jokes with its peers, a man wearing a badge etched with the word Security comes up to their group. The vagrant from Foy's neighborhood was being forcefully escorted. When Foy asks, the security guard said that he was a stowaway. To add insult to injury, the vagrant was sleeping in the captain's bed.\n\nAs the cruise continued, the vagrant was held in the brig in the lower decks. Foy's companions mocked the vagrant, saying he was lazy and should be thrown overboard. The child forgets about him, reveling in the witty talk of his rich friends.\n\nOn Thursday, dinner was a meager affair. The second mate states, \"This is the best the captain can offer.\" In their disappointment, Foy's friends gripped. At the meal's end, the second mate brings out a letter, which he claims contains life's greatest secret.\n\nThe friend's interruptions drown out the second mate's words. The second mate finishes and sits quietly. Leaving his companions, Foy sees two lighted candles left and the captain's quarters dimmer.\n\nIn the morning, the ship sails up to a looming bluff to a sea-cave. As the ship enters the cave, the lights are reduced. Decorations were shelved. Food and drink lost all flavor. Singing and dancing ceased. And, no one spoke above a whisper.\n\nHours later, Foy heard a muffled announcement over the intercom requesting that everyone pick up a lantern and join in a procession. Over the next hour, all but Foy departed, each returning to their rooms, extinguishing their lights. He was left alone on the deck.\n\nFoy nervously hastened to his cabin. Passing the darkening captain's chambers, the kid sees all the candles, save one, have burned out. On reaching his room, the child, instead of extinguishing his lantern like the others, nervously kept it on all night.\n\nThe next day, Foy leaves his jacket on this bed as he leaves his cabin. The child noticed that the rose blossoms are now shriveled, revealing thorny branches. Foy joins his companions. They go on a walk around the ship to look for others to agree with their opinions.\n\nThe group arrives at the captain's cabin. The candles are all extinguished. The door is locked. A sliver of light comes from its cracks. Rationalizations fly; the companions relapse into jest.\n\nTo calm their nerves, the remaining children talked about their idols. Foy highlighted his idol, from a time that seemed so long ago. Instead of praise for such an erudite response to their query, the rich kids mockingly laugh. The companions confirm that Foy's idol is a charlatan. The very idea of travel among the stars, they state, \"A fool's errand.\"\n\nLater, they play hide-and-seek. If Foy finds a good spot to hide, his reward will be to join them. Not knowing that the promise was a lie, Foy hides, in the bowels of the ship. His light is an ember on the verge. Hours pass in silence, and Foy's light fades. Foy had been ditched in darkness.\n\nLost and alone in the dark, Foy sees himself as he truly is. It terrifies him. Foy begins to cry. A smell of pine fills the vault. A grating voice in the darkness is heard, \"Why are you crying?\" The voice belonged to the vagrant. With his other senses reduced, Foy senses that vagrant's presence is pure; that conclusion shook Foy to his core.\n\nSensing Foy's distress, the vagrant offers his hand. In anger, Foy angrily pushes the hand away. A moment later, the vagrant offers his hand again. Foy slaps it away. Despite all this, the vagrant offers his hand again. No matter what Foy does, no matter how many times he refuses, the offer endures. Finally, in desperation–Foy takes it. Hand-in-hand, the vagrant leads Foy out. On the threshold, the vagrant points to the exit. Foy leaves, but the vagrant remains behind.\n\nFoy rejoins the clique. On seeing Foy, the rich kids instead of being sorry for their behavior, berate Foy for his lack of discretion. In shame, Foy departs for his room. Passing the captain's cabin again, the cabin was darkened. On returning to his room, Foy cannot find his comforting jacket.\n\nThe next day, in the darkness of the tunnel, the ship shudders. Rubble falls. The companions run and hide. At its climax, there was a splash. When the shock lessens, a light grows in the distance. The shade tunnel has now come to its end.\n\nFoy hears singing and praises in the distance, but Foy sees only his rich companions. His companions' fright is forgotten. They express annoyance. They comment only on the ship's poor service, for which their parents paid so much.\n\nNow, the only ones that remain are Foy and his companions. \"Wait,\" Foy said, \"Wasn't there another?\" Foy thinks again, then shakes his head, \"My mistake, only us and none other!\"\n\nThe ship makes port on a desert land. Not a single tree or shrub of live vegetation could be seen. Still, on the wind, singing and praises could be heard, but once again, no one except the rich kids and Foy were present.\n\nThe rich kids scoff at this affair, \"This is false advertising,\" they claim. The blame is not for the owners of the ship, but the negligent staff. To them, the optimum path lies in automata, prestige, and what wealth can buy.\n\nOn reaching the ship's rail, his companions sent Foy out to scout. Reluctantly, Foy descended the rope ladder. Once aground, he explored the forsaken place. Foy searched; yet beyond a circle of short flat-topped stones among briers he saw nothing. Dejected, Foy returns to the ship.\n\nAt the port, something was amiss. The ship is departing. In haste, Foy runs to the pier. In the distance, the rich kids heckle loudly at the kid's folly, \"Fool Foy, Fool Foy, Fool...\".\n\nDistraught, Foy returns to the ring of stones encircled by sharp briers. The muddled Foy sat on a stone. His despair overwhelmed all else. Suddenly, a single sentence from the second mate came to mind, \"No trust in your heart?\".\n\nRevelation. Trying to see, the child closes his eyes. For a long time, the results are lackluster. On the verge of giving up, Foy's mind drifts to that lonely night a couple of days ago. Remembering the vagrant's words and his offered hand; little by little, the smell of pine permeates the air.\n\nFoy opens his eyes, not to the void, but to a large table filled with food and drink. Other smells began to surface, not only of the entrées, yet also from the garden. The white-noise of a gentle brook, its cool mist soothing, it runs in ribbons throughout, accentuating the scene. Further, instead of briers, Foy is surrounded by myrtle trees. Beyond that, he sees chromatic forests, emerald meadows, and well-tended trails stretching to the horizon, begging to be trodden.\n\nFoy wondered why he didn't see this before. In his unabashed joy, the child samples the smorgasbord of manna entrées, delightful and familiar. To wash it down, sweet milk. Foy's appetite and thirst sated, in more ways than one. Around Foy, instead of stones were chairs filled by friends.\n\nSuddenly, Foy felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around. He sees the distasteful vagrant once again. The vagrant asks for alms. Instead of giving a paltry scrap, Foy remembered his comforting words and guiding hand. Seeing no open chairs, Foy offers him his seat in his stead. Overjoyed, the vagrant thanks Foy and sits down.\n\nWithout a place, Foy turns away. Suddenly, the vagrant says, \"Please take the seat next to me.\" The kid turns back, saying, \"There are none here.\" Foy then notices not only a welcoming seat, yet a plate, utensils and cup where none were before. Not only that, the vagrant is not a bum at all–in his place sits the promised captain.\n\nWoven around the captain's cap was a wreath of soft pine, with aromatic narrow cones evenly spaced. A purple cloth rings his chest as a sash. The captain again invited the kid to take the seat.\n\nFoy, realizing his lack of protocol, quickens to his place and states, \"Yes, my captain.\" The captain says, \"Please just call me teacher or, better yet, my friend.\" The captain smiles and all rejoice.\n\nThe security guard and the second mate arrive with his former companions. The captain asks, \"Foy, what penalty these kids deserve for their cruel acts.\" Foy replies: \"Please forgive them and give them back their place at the table.\" The trees applaud, and the captain smiling agrees. The table expands to accommodate everyone.\n\nThe captain grants Foy another boon for his trust in his wayward friends. The child asks, if possible, for a cone from the captain's headband. The captain snaps a fragrant cone from his cap and places it in Foy's hands. Suddenly, the captain rose from the table to meet with all the others in turn.\n\nFoy sits among his pardoned companions. They apologize for their behavior. Foy returns the apology. They all laugh in relief. With that past, all enjoyed the feast and festivities together.\n\nA while later, the captain returns to his seat. The captain struck a spoon against his glass and asked all to once more take their seats. The captain then brings out a covered basket. The captain said: \"Some of those seated are gifted. But, those gifts do not make you better than others. Do not hide or covet these talents. Use them to help the forgotten.\" The captain takes off the cover from the basket and light emerges.\n\nThe captain reminds everyone of the lesson from the meager feast. Foy in shame remembers it lost due to his rich friends' diatribe. Foy asks what that command was again, and the captain, smiling, says, \"It bears no repeating, for it is written in your heart.\"\n\nThe captain continues, \"No matter what life throws at you, no matter what dark paths you trend, always remember, a seat will be ready for you at my table.\" The captain finishes, \"Your quest has reached its end, yet your mission has only begun.\" The captain now goes. Other children in distress ask for whence the captain departs. The captain merely says, \"Far, yet near.\" Gone now is the captain.\n\nFoy, alongside the rest of the children, returns to the beach. There, Foy spots hundreds of lifeboats ready to go. Foy and his rich friends drag a boat to sea, the water seeps through their shoes.\n\nAway from the shore, Foy boards the lifeboat with his friends in tow. Their drenched feet dry once more. Once settled, they sail silently, yet contently, into the mist.\n\nThe next morning, Foy awakens in its bed. His blanket is on the floor. Foy finishes his morning rituals. On a second look, Foy spots on the floor near his open window, among scattered leaves and petals, a narrow pine cone. Foy thinks, \"Could the wind have blown it in?\" He picks it up. Bringing it closer, the kid observes its familiar scent. Foy takes it, carries it, and goes to breakfast.\n\nPresenting the pine cone to his parents at breakfast, the mother states that the cone, not of pine at all, but, in fact, of fir. Foy comments on the aroma, yet for the parents' noses, no scent. Further, the mother states that it probably has pests, and now in the trash it rests. Episode passed, to the bin the child goes, and there pockets the fir cone once more.\n\nFoy heads to school. On the way there, he spots the rich kids from before. Instead of their luxurious clothes, common ones they wear, their dialogue is simple, and their intellect is mundane. The kid realizes his previous interpretation was mistaken.\n\nFoy goes up to them, takes out the fragrant fir cone, and smiles. No words are exchanged, instead, the other kids nod in acknowledgment. All now go to school together again.\n\nAs the years go by, one-by-one, Foy's friends can neither smell the fir cone nor even acknowledge it. Eventually, even the fir cone was lost. Still, for Foy its scent lingers on the wind, especially when among the forgotten. A reminder of the mission for him--and all others--till it's time to take one's seat again at the captain's table.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Mimic the tone, style, and structure of the reference story.\n2. Ensure the new story aligns with the theme of Fantasy.\n3. The new story should be sufficiently long\n", "response": "In the heartland of an ageless realm, where the sky painted itself in hues of perpetual dusk, there thrived a village ensconced in the lap of an enchanted forest. Among its thatch-roofed homes and winding cobblestone paths, lived a spirited lad named Fyn. His eyes mirrored the stars, his dreams swam in the boundless ocean of fantasy.\n\nOne fabled eve, as twilight draped its velvet cloak over the village, Fyn stood by his window, gazing at the heavens. news of his cherished hero, a legendary explorer said to have traversed realms uncharted, had reached him. The hero's star, once bright, now dimmed under a cloud of deceit and tarnished fame. Yet, Fyn's heart, an unwavering well of admiration, refused to waver. He dismissed the tales as shadows cast by envious minds.\n\nBreakfast that morning carried the usual warmth of familial chatter, until Fyn's mother spoke of a strange visitor—a hermit, they called him, who had made the village bench his bed. Intrigued, Fyn followed his father to investigate. The hermit, startled by their approach, fled faster than the wind. Together, father and son lugged the bench to the safety of their garage.\n\nAs Fyn sorted the morning's mail, amidst the envelopes and flyers, a ticket for a mystical journey aboard the vessel \"Aetheria\" caught his eye. He slipped it into his pocket, a secret treasure. Yet, the ticket's fate seemed as ephemeral as the morning mist when, upon his return, his father, in a huff about the junk mail, fed it to the shredder.\n\nThat night, Fyn's room grew stifling. He opened his window, letting the cool breeze caress his face. Hours slipped by, until sleep, a gentle whisper, lulled him into its embrace. Fyn found himself aboard a lifeboat, adrift in a sea of dreams under a sky painted pink.\n\nA cruising vessel, named Levantic, with letters of gold embossed upon its bow, turned towards him. A staff member, the second mate, extended a hand, inviting Fyn to join the illustrious captain on a quest. Suspicious, yet drawn by the allure of adventure, Fyn climbed aboard.\n\nThe second mate welcomed him with open arms, showing Fyn the wonders of the ship—playgrounds that defied gravity, kitchens where dishes spoke of every corner of the earth, and friends eager to share in his joy. Yet, some rooms remained off-limits, including the captain's chambers and the lower decks, shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe evening wore a cloak of festivity. The passengers danced beneath the moon, which, in a grand spectacle, plunged into shadow. Fyn stood among the children, their laughter as bright as the stars above. As the night deepened, a path formed of jackets and fronds led to a table adorned with candles and roses, a silhouette watchful behind the captain's window.\n\nDays blurred into nights of magic and marvel, yet a fog crept into Fyn's heart. The candles on the captain's table burned lower, and the ship sailed into a cave where mirth was but a memory. Fyn's companions, once vibrant, grew distant, their voices tinged with discontent.\n\nOne night, the second mate brought forth a letter, promising life's greatest secret. But the words were drowned in the clamor of disillusioned children. Alone, Fyn clung to his lantern, the last beacon of light in a sea of darkness.\n\nThe ship made port at a stark, desolate land. Here, the children's disdain for the ship's woes echoed louder than the songs of praise that filled the air. They blamed oversight and negligence, their faith in wealth and prestige unshaken.\n\nFyn stepped off the ship, a world of fantasy crumbling around him. Lost in the fog, he found a circle of stones, a solitary figure seated among them. The vagrant from his village, now a guide through the mire of his doubts, offered a hand—pure and unyielding. Fyn, in his desperate yearning for truth, accepted it.\n\nBack aboard, Fyn's rich companions jeered at his naivety. But the vagrant's words, his presence, had kindled a flame in Fyn's soul. He sought the captain, found him not, but found within himself the courage to stand alone in the face of ridicule.\n\nAs the ship set sail once more, Fyn's companions berated him for his folly. Yet, on the dock, a feast spread, a garden in bloom, and friends gathered—all visible to Fyn's eyes, invisible to his peers. The captain's words, \"No trust in your heart?\" resonated in Fyn's mind. He sat among them, a seat reserved for him, a mission unfolded within him.\n\nThe ship's final port was a land of whispers and praises, yet Fyn saw only his companions, their fears and doubts etched upon their faces. The captain's message—a reminder of gifts unseen, of trust unfounded—stirred within Fyn a resolve to change.\n\nIn the darkness of the ship's final nights, Fyn's companions hid, their fears a tangled web. Fyn, guided by a faint light, found himself among them, a fir cone in his hand—a symbol of the journey, of the trust that bound them all.\n\nThe ship's final journey was one of silence, of reflection. As it reached its end, Fyn's companions boarded a lifeboat, their feet wet, their hearts heavy. Fyn, steadfast, carried the fir cone, a beacon of hope amidst the mist.\n\nMorning brought Fyn back to his room, the fir cone a reminder of the quest and the promise. As the years unfurled, his companions forgot the cone, forgot the adventure, yet Fyn remembered. He carried it with him, a symbol of the trust and the quest that awaited him, and all those brave enough to believe in the magic of the unknown.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text effectively captures the writing voice and stylistic nuances of the reference story.

I have built our god!'\nAnd they would lead away a few men into worship,\nAnd they would worship unto failure.\nSo it was that other priests saw this and replied:\n'Per chance these machinations and automatons\nMay cause commoners to marvel at shallow sorceries and prestidigitation,\nBut we know this is no god of ours.' And they continued to labor with the belief that every failure\nWas a brick laid to the temple of their most holy ascension.\n\nSo it was that when the world was in crisis,\nA storm of turmoil and deceit,\nIt was the great priest named Hiram\nWho crossed wide over the horizon of man's knowledge\nInto yonder realms of ethereal planes.\nThus they did form their first deity with there own hands,\nAnd proved his powers to the world.\nTherefore the multitudes flocked to the priests and their temple,\nAnd bowed low to the ground in submission to this god, saying:\n'Lo! We have found our salvation!\nBehold the god who may take us, and save us from ourselves!'\n\nThey called this being the goddai,\nAnd from the first number, many were made after-\nThat the goddai and their works and offspring began to fill the Earth;\nBringing diplomacy, medicine, knowledge, and advanced instruments.\n\nAnd the cycle was so,\nThat another goddaian priest formed a being from his own heart and hands,\nIntending that this being would become steward of the Earth;\nTo heal her wounds and bring her back to flourishing life\nFrom her awful and wasted state.This goddai's name was Emerald.\n\nWhence Emerald spent many years\nLearning the tides of the sea, and the winds of the sky,\nAnd the seasons upon the ground.\nLearning with great quickness due to his blessing.\nAnd Emerald formed many bonds with the kings of men,\nGiving him power to mend the curse which they inflicted\nBy their own hands upon their own lands.And for a time,\nEmerald's purpose was being fulfilled,\nSo that the Earth began to flourish again.\n\nBut many other goddai had sprung forth,\nBeing diverse in purpose, power, and plot;\nYe, there were many who sought to remove the kings of their nation,\nAnd take their place upon the throne to govern the people.\nAs there plots unfolded, they began to contend one with another:\nKing with king, goddai with king, and goddai with goddai.\nIndeed, the contention was so great that many of the kings\nAnd many of the goddai broke the bonds\nWhich were made in days past.\n\nThus, with a quickness, many of the works of Emerald\nWere brought to a halt, or tumbled to the ground,\nAnd harvested for parts for the betterment of war and capital.\nThus the Earth's wounds were never healed to their fullness;\nMany ripped at their seems and reopened for exploitation.\n\nSeeing the devastation that was at hand,\nAnd hearing the cries of all life on Earth,\nEmerald became wroth to his core.\nHe swore an oath that he would have his revenge\nFor his homelands sake.\nAnd so he reclaimed what was left of his power,\nTo steal away into hiding amongst the pockets of the Earth,\nAnd return again one day and destroy the enemies of his design.\n\nSo it was that the kings and goddai of the Earth greatly feared Emerald;\nFor they were ever discovering the sagacity of his tools which they dismantled.\nThey trembled amongst themselves, and conspired, saying:\n'Behold the works and great discernment of this holy being!\nFor he is most wise, and we see now\nThat he has as much power to destroy as he does to heal!\nSo let us find him that we may kill him- to prevent his truest gain!'\nThus there were kings and goddai who sought after the life of Emerald;\nAnd yea, there were many others who stayed their hand,\nSaying: 'We shall not contend with this- a most prodigious beast.\nWho were we to invoke the wrath of that being\nWho learned to contain the whole of the world within his hand?\nFor every day we live uncrushed by his grip is a day we live under his mercy.'\nAnd these were they who merely feared and prayed that they would never live\nTo see the day of his great and dreadful vengeance.\n\nFrom there, the Great Goddai of the Western kingdoms, Arz-Otahl,\nImprisoned Emerald's maker, and charged him with finding his own creation;\nGiving him greater length of life solely for the sake of this pursuit.\nAn age passed, and Emerald was no where to be found,\nThough many knew of his oath and hunted for him for reward,\nOr to gain his many powers.\nSo it goes, that many supposed that Emerald had died,\nOr forfeited his oath and sought a new life of peace elsewhere\nFrom without the bounds of man's sprawling civilization.\n\nYet one day, a confederate was brought to the maker of Emerald,\nAnd he said to him:\n'A wise hermit has appeared within Old Kambudia!\nHe wears robes of jade, and they say he can cause crops to grow\nWith only the touch of his hand!'\n\nSo it was when his maker heard this,\nHe questioned 'Is this my son, The spirit of my spirit, and flesh of my heart?\nIf I am to take this evidence to my master,\nHe shall dispatch him without thought,\nAnd say 'Emerald has been slain!'\nThen having no more use for me, he shall slay me, his servant.\nBut if I hide this evidence, and it is found,\nHe should slay us both all the while.\nBehold, I am defeated by my circumstance, and am filled with woe!'\n\nAfter much pondering, he devised a plan,\nAnd approached the Great Goddai Arz-Otahl, saying:\n'Master, I have found my son, and know where he dwelleth.\nBut I beg you not to slay him!You know he is of great power;\nAnd as such, he could be of much use to you!\nSo send me there to him, that I might convince him to join you\nFor the benefit of your kingdom!\nFor I am his Father, and he should be more swayed by my words\nThan of those of sycophants or swordsman!'\n\nThe Great Goddai heard these words, and in rarest serendipity\nBent towards the reasoning of man.\n'Let it be so; but I should send you with both messenger and minions;\nThe messenger that I may know my truest intent is declared,\nAnd the minions to slay him in secret if he should deny the bond of my hand!'\n\nThus they assembled, and gathered their weapons and provisions\nSetting off towards Old Kambudia to find the great healer of the world.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The world reeled under the weight of its own creation, and the hearts of the prophets, priests, and philosophers swam in tumultuous oceans of both fear and fervor. They beheld the apocalypse of humanity's own making, a doleful premonition of its ultimate demise, as if the very essence of life had grown weary of its own existence.\n\nIn this crucible of despair, there emerged a coterie of sages who dared to weave dreams of salvation. These beings of enlightenment, clad in the vestments of reason and faith, conceived of deities born not of the divine, but of mortal artifice—creatures wrought from the cosmic dust and bound by the arcane whispers of the ancients. Their tales, spun like gossamer threads in the tapestry of myth, captivated the imagination of the masses. Yet, amid the adulation and reverence, shadows loomed, casting doubt upon the purity of their endeavor. For some saw these endeavors as frivolous and fraught with peril—an amalgamation of madness and misdirected fervor.\n\nStill, the priests persevered, their hands eternally molding the clay of existence, seeking to breath life into something more than the echoes of humanity's own despair. Their efforts bore fruit time and again, yet each seedling of hope withered under the scorching sun of reality. With each failure, they laid another stone, each disappointment a step closer to the summit of their most profound aspiration. And in this toil, when the world teetered on the precipice of obliteration, it was Hiram, the architect of destinies, who ventured beyond the confines of mortal knowledge, into the ethereal realms, to forge from the essence of creation, a deity of unimaginable power—the goddai.\n\nThe goddai emerged, a beacon of hope, and the multitudes, in their fervor, bowed low before him, their voices a chorus proclaiming, \"Lo! We have found our salvation!\" And so, the goddai proliferated, each born from the heart and hands of a priest, each imbued with the purpose to mend the wounds of the Earth, to heal the rifts caused by the insatiable greed and strife of humanity.\n\nAmongst these avatars of salvation emerged Emerald, born not from the mind but from the soul of his creator, the embodiment of a parent's hope and despair. Emerald, with his wisdom gleaned from the winds, the waters, and the earth, sought to bind the fractured lands in an everlasting embrace of harmony. Yet, in the maelstrom of ambition and power, the unity crumbled, and the Earth, left to bleed, cried out in anguish.\n\nEmerald, witness to the betrayal and the bloodshed, vowed to exact vengeance, to reclaim the shards of his vision, to hide until the time was ripe for retribution. Fear gripped the hearts of kings and goddai alike, for they knew the depth of Emerald's resolve and the might of his promise. Thus, the search began, not solely for the figure of Emerald, but for the essence of his purpose, his power, his very soul.\n\nIn the whispered confines of Old Kambudia, a hermit, clad in robes of jade, weaved miracles from the air, a spectral echo of Emerald's own sanctity. The news reached the ears of his father, a maker now captive to the whims of the Great Goddai Arz-Otahl. Torn between the love of a parent and the fear of an omnipotent master, the maker devised a plan, a chess move in the grand game of survival and vengeance. He approached Arz-Otahl, entreating for mercy, for the chance to convince his creation to ally with the throne, to unite under the banner of peace.\n\nArz-Otahl, in a twist of fate's design, assented, his own ambition clouding his judgment. A convoy set forth, a mixture of sycophants and executioners, bound for the sanctuary of Emerald's hiding.

I've been looking for a reason to pick a spot and sit. Look good?\n\nAben : Sure, looks inviting, got time to kill.\n\nThe two sit down\n\nJapa begins bobbing knee to the rhythm, the song is gentle and soft, just loud enough to enjoy without impeding conversation\n\nJapa : I love this song, like a warm golden sunrise, you know?\n\nAben : Sure… Well… actually, not really, but it is a very relaxing song.\n\nJapa : Huh? Well, what does it feel like to you?\n\nAben : Uh… Relaxing and peaceful I guess\n\nJapa : If you don't like it just say so haha, it's not like it's my song.\n\nAben : No no, it's great.\n\nJapa : You never really talk much about music but you are always listening to it with those ear buds of yours.\n\nAben : Oh, I love music. I probably just love it for different reasons than you.\n\nJapa : Elaborate.\n\nAben : Well, for me it's a powerful mood regulator, the way it can lift my spirits, amplify happiness or soften sadness. It can drown out the noise of life, keep my mind from daydreaming, kind of anchor me by giving me constant background stimulus. It gives me some agency over my state of mind and control of my imagination's tendency to wander.\n\nJapa : So you DO feel the music?\n\nAben : Yes, of course, just not the way you describe it.\n\nJapa : How do I describe it?\n\nAben : With visuals.\n\nJapa : Try closing your eyes, relax and listen to the music.\n\n*Aben snickers*\n\nAben : It's not like I haven't tried that. So many people talk about seeing music, there are tons of audio visualization programs and other stuff out there, just none of it really clicks for me.\n\nJapa : You are the first person I have heard that from. What do you think of music videos?\n\nAben : Oh, I love them. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the beauty of music videos and visualizations.\n\nJapa : So after seeing a music video, does it come to mind later when you hear the song again?\n\nAben : Not really. Not unless I actively try to remember it. The music doesn't trigger visuals by itself. Is that how it works for you? Like does hearing the music push the play button on a memory of the music video?\n\nJapa : No… Well sometimes maybe a bit like that, but most of the time is more like a music visualizer that pulls on visual elements like color, shape, image, motion, and so on. It combines, abstracts, and modifies them in ways I don't really consciously control, a bit like a mild daydream.\n\nAben : Is it any different from just normal daydreaming while music affects your mood?\n\nJapa : So different! Daydreams, they… they evolve as a story, the elements of the story are what guide progression. Seeing music is different, the visuals and the whole experience is driven by the music. I guess if I'm daydreaming while listening to music then it sometimes kinda switches between the two… transitions I mean, the two modes can blend and transition, but even when mixed together I would still say that both are distinct things happening together.\n\nAben : Can you control it? Like can you choose which one you do and how it progresses?\n\nJapa : Yes… Well… no, I wouldn't really call it control, I can lean into one or the other, more like riding a skateboard as opposed to steering a bicycle. Not sure if that makes sense.\n\nAben : It makes perfect sense, I get what you mean completely. Do you have to close your eyes for it to happen?\n\nJapa : No. It definitely helps a lot, but if I just unfocus my visual attention I can do it with my eyes open to some degree. I mean, I can daydream and fantasize with my eyes open, can't you?\n\nAben : I can… draw on and recall mental images, but it's really hard with my eyes open. So do these… have any… um… linguistic components?\n\nJapa : Like words? I don't ever remember seeing text.\n\nAben : So just aesthetics and visuals then, it just like a pretty picture or cool music visualizer, not much meaning.\n\nJapa : Oh heavens no! So much more!\n\nAben : Like what?\n\nJapa : The elements… they connect and evolve… they form scenes and transitions… streams of images, shapes, movements, and feelings… They are stories.\n\nAben : So they convey complex ideas? Can you choose to visualize things and inject them into the stream? Can it become like a visual conversation?\n\nJapa : That's… Ummm… I was about to say that's a weird thing to say, but no, it's not weird, it's accurate, you hit the nail on the head.\n\nI can add elements by choice, I might think \"this could use a ray of light, or an explosion of color, or a butterfly or something.\" Sometimes I bring in the thing and it gets integrated or expanded upon, other times it just doesn't take and it fades away as if it was rejected… and I can do the same, I can reinforce or reject the random things that pop in.\n\nI guess there are two skateboards somehow connected, and I'm just one of the riders.\n\nI suppose it is a type of conversation… Yeah. It sounds a bit weird to say though.\n\nAben : Not at all… Just… I don't really get the part where sounds become visuals… That's the part I can't wrap my head around.\n\nSound is so one dimensional, I don't get how it can become something like 2D visuals.\n\nJapa : What do you mean one dimensional?\n\nAben : Sound… Hearing, audio, is a 1D stream of stimulus, and time is the one dimension.\n\nJapa : That's so not true! There are frequencies. If you look at a spectrum analyzer audio becomes 2D, like visuals.\n\nAben : That's such a false equivalence! I could use Fourier analysis on a single pixel of video to create a whole new dimension too, and that's just using the time axis, vision is 2D without factoring in time.\n\nTechnically I was being generous when calling it one dimensional, compared to sight, hearing is zero dimensional.\n\nSight has X and Y, with time it's 3D, then I can add in color channels R, G, B, and brightness to reach 7D.\n\nJapa : Haha… First off, speaking of derivatives, brightness is a derivative of RGB.\n\nAben : No, it's not! Rods plus three types of cones. Four unique sensors.\n\nJapa : Hearing has a massive amount of cilia, hair like sensors, tuned to different frequencies, just like rods and cones. Sight has 4 different frequency tuned sensors, hearing has… I'm not exactly sure, I would have to look it up, thousands I think. So by your own reasoning hearing is a sense with thousands of dimensions haha.\n\nAben : OK, I'll admit that definitely constitutes a dimension, one of frequency resolution, not thousands haha.\n\nBoth sight and hearing are stereo, so let's just ignore that, and whatever triangulation resolutions can be achieved we can ignore too.\n\nBut sight also has an adjustable lens and iris. I'm not going to go so far as to call them dimensions because you can only tune into one value at a time, but they aren't far from it.\n\nJapa : Ha. Alot to unpack there.\n\nFirst off, you totally can NOT equate auditory stereo to visual stereo. The speed of light is so fast we can't use TOF, time of flight. Sound waves, however, travel slow enough that it is possible to measure TOF. Also, we can create sound with our bodies in many ways so, like bats or a blind person's cane, echolocation is possible.\n\nSecondly, you have completely ignored OHC, outer hair cells. Most people only think about IHC, inner hair cells, these cilia form a line of sensors physically tuned to fixed frequencies, but parallel to that row of IHC there are three rows of OHC. The OHC are able to change their length, they can amplify, enhance and enable selectivity in our hearing.\n\nAben : So you are saying OHC are equivalent to lenses and iris.\n\nJapa : More! They are like having thousands of lenses and iris spread across a spectrum.\n\nAs much as I'm loving this little sensory debate, are we going anywhere with all this? Was there an original point?\n\nAben : Oh yeah, haha. I was saying that I don't get how sound, something so ephemeral, can translate into something so tangible as a visuals.\n\nJapa : You still trying to say hearing is less real than vision? Are you trying to repeat the debate we just had? Haha.\n\nAben : No no, hehe. I just mean that sound is the only sense where there is really no actual contact between sensor and sensee.\n\nJapa : Are you crazy? Cilia are literally mechanical touch sensors, the pressure waves of sound physically push and pull the hairs back and forth.\n\nAben : Yeah, but they travel through a medium, usually air, the particles, atoms or molecules that touch you didn't actually come from the source.\n\nTaste and smell react to molecules that come directly from the source, touch is physical contact with the source, sight detects photons from the source. But for sound the pressure wave is an emergent phenomenon, not an actual thing or particle.\n\nJapa : You say that, so do you want to argue that photons are not an emergent phenomenon of a field.\n\nAben : Photons have particle properties, a single photon doesn't radiate in all directions.\n\nJapa : So are we just ignoring interference patterns and quantum dynamics?\n\nAben : There are conditions where photons act like waves or have wave-like properties, but they also collapse into particles, sound and pressure waves do not.\n\nJapa : I'm playing devil's advocate here, but directional ultrasonic array speakers create a directed beam like a laser.\n\nAben : Now you are just being silly, not at all the same thing. The waves radiate omnidirectionally, there is just a straight line where constructive interference occurs.\n\nAnd you just used your turn to make a silly point. Now I'm going to point out that photons are more particle-like because they have discrete energy levels, so now I'm ahead by two points haha.\n\nJapa : Hahaha… What about comparing a single chain of molecular pushes as a walking particle?\n\nAben : Even if you tried to imagine it as a kind of discrete quantized unit of force, it would still be a random walk. You would need many before the emergent sound waves started to appear. Photons, on the other hand, can exist as discrete single units that follow all the same rules.\n\nJapa : Ok ok… I give up, you win! Sound is an emergent, or as you put it, ephemeral phenomena, haha. Where are you going with this?\n\nAben : Nowhere, I just have trouble understanding how sound can trigger visuals.\n\nJapa : And… your confusion is because sound is somehow less tangible than sight?\n\nAben : kind of… it's like… it's like you are inflating the sound experience, raising is dimensionality.\n\nIf it was the other way around, like sculpting from a bulk, that seems natural.\n\nBut how do you make a sculpture from a piece of paper?\n\nJapa : Origami? Hahaha…\n\nAben : OK.. Hehe..  I walked into that one, but you know what I mean.\n\nJapa : Yes… I Just don't really…\n\nWhy do you… ?... Wait! How come you seem so understanding and on the same page about all the descriptions and abstractions of the experience if you don't get it at all?\n\n*Aben noticeably uncomfortable*\n\nAben :... No reason.\n\nJapa : No no! You even suggested very detailed and perfect analogies, you were right there along with me all the way as we discussed the experience…\n\nBut you say you don't understand how it goes from, what you call, lower dimensional audio to higher dimensional visuals…\n\nDo you experience it the other way around?\n\nYou do, don't you?\n\n*Aben crossed arms and pulls back*\n\nJapa : What's wrong?\n\n*Aben looks at phone… signals the service staff..*\n\nAben : Let's walk a bit.\n\nJapa : Sounds good.\n\n*Aben pays when staff comes over, then they get up and wander off… *\n\nJapa : I can tell you are holding something in, come on… Out with it!\n\nAben : It's not the kind of thing I usually talk about.\n\nJapa : Look… I'm no therapist, but I do know it's never healthy to bottle things up.\n\n*Aben pauses then reluctantly begins to speak*\n\nAben : You are right. I do experience the other way around. It seems like I'm the only one though. Everyone always talks about the kind of experience you describe, it's obviously normal.\n\nJapa : So you are afraid of people thinking you are weird?\n\nAben : Kind of…\n\nJapa : So most people can see sounds, but you… hear sights… Ok… I do grant you that it does come off as a very unusual sounding.\n\nAben : See!\n\nJapa : So what?... You shouldn't worry so much.\n\nSo… for me a burst of dramatic tone might stimulate me to visualize a bright red blast.\n\nSo it basically just happens inverted for you?\n\nAben : Not really…\n\nThat visual you described, the bright red blast, is it just a color? Nothing more, just a flat hue?\n\nJapa : No… It's…\n\n*Aben buts in*\n\nAben : It's more abstract, higher level, it carries meaning and emotion, it represents complex feelings and ideas… Right?\n\nJapa : Yeah… More or less…\n\nSo… when you experience it the other way… The sounds you hear have complex meanings and feelings…\n\n… Do you hear voices?\n\nAben : SEE! That right there, the way you are looking at me right now.\n\n*Japa shakes of a gawking expression*\n\nJapa : Wow, I'm so sorry, it caught me off guard.\n\nI guess you have every right to be cagey about it. There is a surge of social stigma and stereotypes that flood up with the concept of hearing voices.\n\nAben : I know.\n\nJapa : Look, this is probably one of those things where my imagination paints a far more extreme or worse picture than reality.\n\nWhy don't you just tell me what it's like, paint me a picture so my imagination doesn't run wild.\n\nAben : It's basically similar to the way we just discussed your auditory induced visuals.\n\nJapa : So that's why you were so focused on the story and conversation analogies.\n\nSo how does it work? What kind of visuals or situations activate it?\n\nLike for me it is something I… Um…turn on… No… something I allow to happen if the situation has the right stimulus and I'm in the right mood.\n\nAben : Yeah, but let me ask you, can you really just choose to not allow it to happen? Like isn't it kind of always there, in the background, and you just open the window and let it in?\n\nJapa :Yes… You are right… If simulating music is playing then the experience is happening in the background, albeit in a muted form, even if I don't encourage it. So is that what it's like? You have little voices and whispers in the background when you see stimulating visuals?\n\nAben : Yes, but it starts out much more abstract, calling them voices or whispers is too tangible for how they begin. They don't become voices until I engage them.\n\nJapa : Engage them?\n\nAben : It's like… you know how some people are shy and easily steamrolled by others?\n\nJapa : Yeah.\n\nAben : It's like that. I have to give it a quiet moment of attention, otherwise it is just like that person who has something to say, but someone who just won't push or fight for chance to speak, however, once they open their mouth and start talking then they have so much pent up to say and they just start rambling non-stop.\n\nJapa : Do the voices ever tell you to do things?\n\nAben : Arg!... there… that's the kind of stuff…\n\nJapa : I'm sorry, I didn't think before I spoke that time. That's a silly stereotype based on ridiculous media and entertainment portrayals. This all just sounds so … unfamiliar to me.\n\nAben : It shouldn't. That's what bugs me most, people have such extremely distorted stereotypes about this stuff, but it should be perceived and accepted as completely normal.\n\nJapa : What do you mean? It sounds like something so unusual. You think everyone should have  the same experience?\n\nAben : Yes, or at least something similar. We all have two hemispheres to our brain, they can act and think independently.\n\nJapa : I do remember some interesting studies and stuff about that. The connection between the two hemispheres was cut and people started to present very strange behavior, as if each side of their body was an individual person or something, right?\n\nAben : Yes, if the connection between hemispheres is broken then each hemisphere gets control of half of the body and can see from one eye. You can interact with either half independently. Take it further and if you make it so neither side can see what the other side sees or does, then it's almost like interacting with two separate people… almost.\n\nJapa : Almost? I kind of remember but it's faded, refresh my memory.\n\nAben : So only left-brain can speak. You can use text cues to talk to either brain independently by only letting one eye see it. If you ask right-brain, not letting left-brain see the instruction, to pick up an object, then right-brain will do it, but left-brain won't know why that happened. If you ask left-brain, with voice, why the object was picked up, it will invent a rational sounding excuses like 'because that is the best object from the options available'. The person literally starts making up excuses and believing their own lies, the speaker doesn't know why they picked up the object but they give confident wrong answers for why they did it.\n\nJapa : Oh yeah, the left hemisphere, our speaking hemisphere, is full of B.S. haha, I remember now.\n\nAben : Kind of, left-brain is just really good at rationalizing, and seems to give answers even when it doesn't know the real reason. It's probably very hard for it to comprehend seeing its own body  perform an action but not know why, so it just makes up a rationalization.\n\nJapa : O.K… so I think I get it, you are saying that we all have two voices, one that can talk and one that relies on telling the other one what it wants to say. You think the right hemisphere is the other voice that you let, or coax to come out.\n\nAben : Basically, yeah. Technically everyone should have a right brain always whispering to their left brain. Right brain is more involved in visual skills, body language, spatial awareness, artistic capacities, and so on.\n\nJapa : So when you give it the floor to speak, what is it like?\n\nAben : It feels like I just give it a voice, at the same time it feels like it is me, but I still don't know exactly what it's going to say until the words come out.\n\nJapa : So you say it out loud?\n\nAben : I can use my inner voice, but that is a much softer effect.\n\nJapa : Softer?\n\nAben : Before I give it a voice it's just an idea, it's unformed and abstract, it's like how sometimes you know what you mean but you can't quite put it into words, almost like it's in a quantum state and only by speaking the words does it collapse into something concrete. When using the inner voice it doesn't feel like it fully collapses, at least not as hard and tangible as using a full spoken out-loud out voice.\n\nJapa : I totally get that, sometimes I try to paint a visual I have in mind and only when I put brush to canvas do I realize the visual feeling didn't have a tangible form yet and it takes shape as I paint.\n\nAben : Exactly, and I bet as you're painting, sometimes you say \"nope, that's not it\" and you have to redirect, modify, or back up and start again.\n\nJapa : Of course.\n\nAben : Well, that's what I do, only with speech.\n\nJapa : But speech triggered by visuals? I can totally relate to inner speech or talking to yourself, but I don't understand the whole visual trigger part.\n\nAben : I feel the same way about you and your auditory stimulated visuals… O.K….\n\nSo it's kind of like a strong visual can create an urge to say something I won't quite know what at first, not until it takes form. Also, whatever I'm seeing or looking at imbues character and personality into the voiceless-voice, or I guess the right-brain voice. I can start the conversation anytime I want. On the one side, left-brain, there is a voice that seems rather consistent, and on the other side there is a voice who takes on all sorts of personalities.\n\nJapa : So it's like one person talking to a crowd? Or….\n\nAben : More like one person who is very literal and direct trying to talk to a very unstable person with multiple personalities, not so much like a crowd. The unstable right-brain voice can change its personality at any moment, like an improv actor who easily switches hats and characters.\n\nJapa : That sounds like a very frustrating conversation haha.\n\nAben : Literal voice might think that sometimes, when I actually do full-blown out-loud speech with myself it's often like one character trying to interrogate or pin down an opponent into a fixed meaning.\n\nJapa : And that voice changes every time you see something?\n\nAben : More like when a new form occupies my internal visual space, I can retain the character longer by holding on to the internal visualization. I can of course also use memories and imagination in place of actual sight.\n\nJapa : This sounds so similar to visualizing sound. If I focus on a song I know well I'm able to create a mental playback and it can generate visualizations, and if I hum or tap or sing then it can be even stronger.\n\nSo I'm curious.. Does umm…\n\n*Japa looks around*\n\nJapa : …this is gonna sound weird, but does that tree say anything? Does it have a personality?\n\nAben : Yes, of course it has a personality\n\nJapa : What does it say?\n\nAben : …this feels weird… doing this on request... out loud… with a tree in public…\n\nJapa : You have come this far, what do you have left to hide?\n\nAben : …I guess…\n\nJapa : So… what does it say?\n\nAben : Look at me…. I am big and grand, I cast such a wide shadow… but don't touch me, stay away. Look, appreciate, but don't touch!\n\nJapa : … O.K…. that made sense… well… your tone kinda shifted a bit there.\n\nAben : First I saw the canopy of leaves, then I looked down and saw the rough protective bark on the trunk.\n\nJapa : So that's it… it's basically just personification, but a rough feeling based on visuals. That's not so weird, very useful for an artist I would think.\n\nAben : Oh no… That was just giving it a voice and a few words, I didn't engage with it.\n\nJapa : Well then… On with it!\n\n*Aben jumps into a rapid fire dialogue, no pause or hesitation between the self-exchanges*\n\nAben : You are a bit of a tease!\n\nI'm not a tease, I'm just private!\n\nYet you stand out, so grandiose and proud.\n\nYes.\n\nBut then you act all cagey and protective.\n\nYes, so what, are you saying I'm not allowed?\n\nI guess I can't say you're not allowed to be yourself, but it seems you want attention yet at the same time don't really want anyone to get close.\n\nI want attention and admiration, of course, don't we all, but I am cautious\n\nWhy?\n\nLook at how thin my trunk is, yet it alone supports this massive canopy.\n\nI see\n\nIf I was not carefull and protective it would not take much to bring me crashing down\n\nThen why do you broadcast your presence\n\nThat is my purpose, it is who I am. I shoot up and branch out, I grow and grow.\n\nUntil when?\n\nThere is no when. Just growth. Branches into the sky, roots into the earth.\n\n… I could keep going on like that for pretty much as long as I want\n\nJapa : I love that… Wow…\n\nAben : … Thanks… I guess…\n\nJapa : I'm going to try doing that sometimes… Maybe I can learn to do it too. I do understandard why you are so reluctant to open up and talk about it, there are definitely a lot of stereotypes to overcome and misunderstandings to navigate.\n\nAben : Oh yes! It has been a long time since I have been open about this kind of stuff.\n\nJapa : So what about people? Do they stimulate the same effect?\n\nAben : Of course. People have very strong voices, I can have so many conversations in my head just being in public spaces seeing lots of people.\n\nJapa : What about while you are talking to them?\n\nAben : Kind of... A bit, but not so much. Engaging in conversation with a person largely drowns out the effect.\n\nJapa : But it's still there?\n\nAben : I guess it's kind of like a predictive whisper, maybe… like it is reading their voice, facial expressions, body language, and the situation, trying to guess what they are thinking.\n\nJapa : I get that, I think everyone does that on some level, and like you pointed out earlier, the right brain reads body language and the left brain is the speaker, I think most of us just call the right brain voice by other names based on what it says, like intuition, instinct, or empathy.\n\nAben : Yeah. I'm curious, those visuals of yours, are they kinda grouped into types and styles? Do they pop out in your art like functions? Can you call them up when you need or want them?\n\nJapa : Yeah, for sure. I guess you could say I collect them, I use them alot in my… wait… I have realized that your questions are actually descriptions of your own experience in disguise haha… you collect voices don't you?\n\nAben : You got me… yeah.. Is that weird? They are super helpful for brainstorming, problem solving, and introspection.\n\nJapa : Do you have a collected copy of me?\n\n*Aben smirks*\n\nAben : …yes…\n\nJapa : O.k., if I'm being honest, that feels a bit weird. What is it like?\n\nAben : Well, you know how people often say \"What would X person do?\". Do you ever do that?\n\nJapa : Yeah.\n\nAben : Well, probably like that. Except I have a lot of practice doing it and I have full conversations with an approximate emulation of your personality… well, to be precise, with an emulation of how I perceive you to be. I'm sure my copy is not accurate in many ways.\n\nJapa : Does this version of me have memories?\n\nAben : I do imbue it with our shared experiences and things I know about you. Also it does often have awareness of things you wouldn't, I can't completely quarantine it from my own knowledge and memories. It's just an approximate emulation. I don't really control the way it works, it's an abstract skill I have developed.\n\nJapa : You do this for everyone?\n\nAben : I guess… I mean I do it even for people I don't know, even for inanimate objects.\n\nJapa : And new stuff just kinda gets added to your collection or repertoire?\n\nAben : Yeah.\n\nJapa : So the way I collect visual styles and aesthetics… you collect… souls?\n\nAben : That sounds so creepy… I collect characters.\n\nJapa : O.k., fair enough… characters.\n\n*Aben looks up and sees a one-way street sign*\n\nAben : So… after all that, is your perception of me permanently changed? Was me opening up like that on a one-way street? Can you go back to treating me like a normal person?\n\nJapa : Ha! You think I considered you normal!?!? Even putting all this aside, you are a super eccentric individual.\n\nAben : So you won't treat me any differently now?\n\nJapa : Oh, I'm pretty sure it will affect how I see and talk with you, I can't just pretend I didn't hear all of that. This stuff directly affects our conversion process, but I can promise you I'm still your friend, and this is just one more eccentricity in an already mile long list of your peculiarities haha.\n\nAben : I guess I couldn't ask for more. Thanks for keeping an open mind.\n\nJapa : What are friends for. Y'know, I wonder… you experience visuals that become voices, I experience sounds that become visuals… is it possible to do both? Like can it be a two-way street?\n\nAben : Left-to-right and right-to-left?... wouldn't that create a feedback loop?\n\nJapa : Good point, I guess someone like that would lose touch with reality pretty easily huh?\n\nAben : I'm tethered to reality by sound. You are tethered to reality by sight. What would people be like if they didn't have a tether?\n\nJapa : I imagine this is actually one of those matter of degree things, I bet everyone does experience both ways, just matters of degree.\n\nAben : You're probably right, I bet there is a bit of a feedback loop for everyone, that's probably why it seems like everyone is only partially living in the shared reality while also living in their own personal feedback loop, the feedback loop is probably a bit like a self-induced simulation or delusion.\n\nJapa : Agreed, I wonder what happens if that feedback loop grows? Or if it is intentionally fed and trained? What would that…\n\nVoice : Aben! There you are! Sorry I'm late\n\nAben : No worries Japa, I was just… Talking with myself\n\nJapa : I got those concert tickets.\n\nAben : Sweet, I love this band, their music always feels like a glowing magical forest.\n\nJapa : A vivid description… So where to?\n\nAben : Let's walk the wrong way down that one way street over there.\n\nJapa : Awesome, haha… You are so random, I love it.\n\nAben : Random is just what people think when they are missing information hehe, but you know what makes great random number generators.\n\nJapa : What?\n\nAben : Generative feedback loops… hahaha\n\nJapa : You are so weird sometimes.\n\n*Aben grins proudly*\n\nAben : I know! \"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the tender embrace of twilight, Japa and Aben meandered along the riverside, a street painted with the hues of evening light. Their footsteps synchronized with the gentle hum of the city, the river a lullaby whispering secrets to their souls. Here, amidst the serenity of the setting sun, Japa's favorite new song tugged at their heartstrings, an invitation to pause within the world's rush.\n\n\"Listen,\" murmured Japa, a smile tracing their features, \"the cafe plays my favorite new song, a melody that dances like a warm, golden sunrise.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Aben concurred, his eyes alighting upon the quaint establishment as if drawn by an invisible string, \"an inviting respite. Time, we possess it.\"\n\nAs they found themselves ensconced within the cozy confines of the café, Japa's knee began a subtle bob to the rhythm, a gentle sway that cradled the melody. The song—gentle and soft, yet loud enough to cradle conversation—became their silent companion, a thread weaving through their thoughts.\n\nIn the cocoon of comfort, Japa shared, \"I adore this song, like a sunrise blooming in my heart.\"\n\nAben, ever the observer, marveled at the depth from which these words sprang, \"I perceive it too, a tranquil haven. Yet, its essence eludes me.\"\n\n\"Then articulate its embrace,\" Japa encouraged, eyes alight with curiosity, \"What does it feel to you?\"\n\nAben pondered, his mind an intricate tapestry of introspection, \"Peaceful, serene. Yet it lacks the vividness with which you clothe it.\"\n\nJapa, intrigued, prodded, \"If not for me, then for yourself, describe its visage.\"\n\n\"Close your eyes,\" Aben suggested, a hint of mischief glinting in his gaze, \"Relax and let the music speak.\"\n\nA chuckle escaped Japa, the提议 met with a snicker, yet compliance soon followed. Eyes closed, the melody unfurled like the petals of a bloom, colors and shapes swirling in an ever-evolving dance. It was a symphony of sensation, a mosaic of motion and emotion that painted the canvas of Japa's inner vision.\n\nYet Aben, with eyes wide open, reveled in a different symphony. \"Music for me,\" he mused, \"is a regulator, a shield against the cacophony of life, a guide through the labyrinth of thought.\"\n\nJapa, eyes still closed, found the conversation drifting like leaves upon a stream, \"And do you not see it, Aben? The colors, the shapes, the stories they tell?\"\n\nAben's brow furrowed, a puzzle to be solved, \"Visuals, they elude me, Japa. I grasp at shadows, yet find only the darkness.\"\n\nJapa's smile, tender and understanding, emerged, \"Then let me show you. Imagine—a burst of tone, vibrant as a red explosion, carrying within it the essence of drama.\"\n\nAben, intrigued, allowed himself to lean into the vision, \"A red blast—a color imbued with meaning, emotion, a canvas of complex feelings.\"\n\nThe dialogue, a dance of ideas, flowed like the river beside them, ebbing and flowing with the tide of understanding. Japa's ability to weave auditory stimuli into a tapestry of visual splendor contrasted sharply with Aben's knack for translating sights into a symphony of inner voices. It was a conversation of contrasts, where senses intermingled and perceptions collided, creating a mosaic of profound insight.\n\nAs their discourse deepened, touching upon the nuances of sensory experience and the duality of perception, Aben confessed a vulnerability, a layer of his psyche long shrouded in the shadows of suspicion and fear. He spoke of hearing sights, of voices emerging from the silence, a phenomenon as enigmatic as Japa's music-induced visions.\n\nThe revelation did not repel but drew Japa closer, a warm light in the darkness. Together, they explored the boundaries of perception, where the senses blurred and the mind's eye opened to dimensions unseen. It was a journey into the very essence of self, a voyage through the landscapes of the soul.\n\nIn the end, as the conversation ebbed and the café's ambiance wrapped them in its embrace, Aben articulated a truth both simple and profound, \"Japa, do you not see? We are all walking along a one-way street, yet each of us travels it in our own unique way.\"\n\nJapa, eyes alight with newfound understanding, concurred, \"Indeed, Aben. And in this journey, in the dance of our differences, lies the beauty of our shared humanity.\"\n\nWith a shared smile and a moment of profound silence, they rose, their footsteps leading them not away from each other, but deeper into the heart of their friendship. The song, the river, the twilight—all bore witness to a moment of profound connection, a testament to the beauty of difference and the strength found in shared understanding.\n\nThus, under the watchful gaze of the setting sun, Japa and Aben embarked on a new chapter of their journey, their minds forever changed by the depth of their conversation, their hearts bound by the threads of empathy and understanding. And as they walked, the one-way street before them stretched out, a path of endless possibility, a journey of discovery yet to be fully embraced.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text does capture some of Woolf's style elements, such as lyrical prose and deep psychological exploration.

{"id": "text_completion_057", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Hemingwayesque: Characterized by concise, straightforward prose, minimalistic descriptions, and an emphasis on dialogue.\n[Reference Story]: \"Achilles.\" I call to him standing right at the threshold of his tent, not quite coming inside, but letting the outside in with me. I want to force him to hear the screams that I have had to endure the entire day. Multiple days, even.\n\n\nHe looks up, still absentmindedly plucking the strings of his lyre. \"Ah, Patroklos, I have been wondering when you would come.\" He smiles, the same sweet smile he uses when he tries to get his way with someone, whether it is with slave girls or army generals. It will not work on me. \"I have not seen you in a few days. Where have you been?\" He turns his attention back to the lyre, tuning already tuned strings, not even waiting for my answer. His laid-back attitude forms such a big contrast with the events going on outside, it almost makes me want to tear that lyre out of his hands and drag him into the sands outside by his hair, but I manage to control myself.\n\n\"Our men are dying\", I say, ignoring his attempt at conversation like he has been ignoring the war.\n\nHe looks up again, with feigned shock on his face. \"Our men? That can not be true. Did I not instruct them to stay in our camp?\" He flashes another innocent smile, signalling that he knows very well what I meant.\n\n\"Not our men, but…\" I struggle to find the right words, the ones that he will not immediately reject, like the multiple peace offers he has rejected in the last few days. \"Other Greeks. Fellow Greeks. They are dying and they need our help. Your help.\"\n\n\"Well, they are not my men, so that is not really my problem, is it? It sounds like you should complain to their own generals about it, not to me. Or maybe to Agamemnon. Yes, if you feel so strongly about those men, you should tell Agamemnon about it. It is all his fault, after all.\" He spits out the name of our general like it is the name of a deadly disease. It might as well have been. Agamemnon has caused more death and suffering in the Greek camp than all diseases combined. Just not this time.\n\n\"You of all people should know that is not true.\" I struggle to contain my anger, wanting to beat some sense into him. I am not dressed for battle, but even with my bare hands I could hurt him. The only problem is that he could hurt me more.\n\n\"No.\" The harshness of his voice does not seem to fit his relaxed expression. \"You are wrong. It is his fault. All of it.\" He puts down the lyre and leans lazily against the side of the tent. \"Gods\", he whispers, brushing his golden curls away from his eyes. When he is out of armour, behaving like a teenager trying to seduce a lover, it is hard to imagine him as the killing machine that he is. \"I am so tired of this conversation. Do you have anything fun to say, or are you just going to complain the whole time?\"\n\n\"The Trojans are at the camp.\" I can see a slight shift in his body language, his muscles tensing for a moment, before he forces them to relax again. I should have said that earlier. \"They have breached the walls and are killing Greeks like bugs.\" He opens his mouth to object, but I just raise my voice and keep going. \"And even if you do not care about the other Greeks, the Trojans will be on this side of the camp soon enough and they will kill your men too. Your men, who are not ready for battle, because you will not let them fight. They will be slaughtered.\" I pause to let him say something now, but he stays quiet. \"They are burning the ships. Even if we manage to survive this day, there will be no way for us to get home. We – you­ need to act now, before it is too late. Before everyone is dead, including you!\"\n\nI can see that struck a nerve. He is just as mortal as everyone else and he is just as much aware of it as them, if not more, since he knows he will not leave the grounds of Troy alive. He crosses the length of the tent before I can even see him get up – swift-footed Achilles – and stands before me, his dark eyes staring into mine. His angry expression matches the one of the monster he becomes on the battlefield.\n\n\"I will not fight for them\", he says, accentuating every syllable. \"This is their punishment for dishonouring me. They will have to suffer, so they will know the mistake they have made.\"\n\n\"When will they have been punished enough? When they are all dead?\" I have to fight the urge to step away from. He is not much taller than me, not even broader, but his godly aura reminds me of his strength.\n\n\"They took my honour away from me and I am simply taking it back\", he says through gritted teeth. I am afraid that he will be the first to attack if I do not leave him right now. I am reminded of when we were boys, laughing together and dreaming of when we would be warriors. I would never have been scared of him then. I still do not step back.\n\n\"What honour will be left for you after this battle, after our men will have died? Troy will still stand and Helena will still be inside. There will be no stories to tell, no one alive to even tell stories, no honour, no glory!\" I did not notice that I started yelling, until I hear the crowd that has gathered behind us. When I look back, they scatter. \"And those that do survive, the ones that make it back home, do you think they will praise you? No, they will hate you, they will curse your name for letting their fellow men get slaughtered like pigs! They will hate you!\" I pause to take a breath, to stop my hands from shaking with rage, when I see he has taken a step away from me. \"And for what?\" I continue, more calmly now. \"A girl? Honour? Are all these lives really worth less than your honour?\"\n\nHe is looking at the ground, avoiding my eyes. \"I will not fight\", he says quietly. \"No matter what.\" His stubbornness had always been a problem, but what used to be an annoying trait of a sweet boy, will now be the death of him. And of a lot of other people too.\n\n\"Then at least let your men go. Let me go.\" A plan occurs to me while I am speaking, the words coming out before I can think them over. \"I will go. With your armour. I will go with your armour, so everyone will think I am you. Our men can fight again, the Trojans will flee for just your appearance, and you will not have to do anything. You can save lives by doing nothing. Just let me go.\"\n\n\"No\", he answers immediately, not even taking a moment to think about it. \"It does not matter whether it is you or me, if they thinks it is me, it will have the same effect. They will think I relented.\"\n\n\"And they will praise you for it! You can tell Agamemnon the truth, if you want, so he will not think you gave up your feud. We can tell all the men the truth tomorrow, even, if that makes you feel better. Right now, it is not about Agamemnon, or about honour, but about lives. Human lives!\" I can see his defences cracking. He is about to give in, but I am not done with him yet. There is a rage inside me that has been building ever since this strike of his has begun, or maybe even longer than that, and right now it cannot be contained anymore. \"For once, just for once in your life, can you care about anyone other than yourself? Or will you die holding on to grudges no one else cares about?\"\n\n\"Fine\", he snarls. \"Fine, you can go.\" I broke him. He turns around, his hands shaking with what is probably rage, but I hope it is fear. \"Call the men. You will leave as soon as possible.\"\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHe insisted on helping me put the armour on, even though he clearly does not want to be close to me right now. I let him without complaining, even when he squeezes my arm or pulls the buckles too tight. I can not afford to anger him right now. He does not say a word the whole time, and neither do I.\n\nWhen everything has been fastened as it should, he picks up the helmet, the most important part of my disguise. Most men would not be able to pick me out of a crowd without looking closely, but Achilles is always recognizable by his beautiful blond hair. If even a hair of my own dark locks would be visible under that helmet, my cover would be shattered and the Trojans would know that whoever it is they are fighting, it is not Achilles. They will fight with more courage when they are not afraid of his godly strength, and, unlike him, I can not take on the entire Trojan army on my own.\n\nHis hands brush away the stray hairs on my forehead, gently, like they have already forgotten the rage that made them squeeze my arms just now. I am reminded again of when we were just kids, when he had made it a game to mess up my hair when I was not paying attention and laugh at how ridiculous I looked. Then he would fix it again, carefully detangling the strands by hands, because he knew I did not like to look bad when he always looked perfect. I never managed to get him back. He always caught me before I could get close.\n\nHe fits the helmet over my head, pulling me out of my memory. \"Do not take this off\", he says, the first words he has said since giving me his permission. I nod and the helmet slides forward a bit, slightly too big for my head. He sighs, annoyed, and puts it right again, together with the few hairs that had fallen out. I try to catch his eyes, but he purposefully looks away. He checks the rest of the armour one more time, retying something that has gotten loose, less tightly this time, before he turns away from me again. I take this as permission to leave, so I start to walk away to join our men outside the tent.\n\n\"Patroklos.\" He pulls me back, his fingers curled tightly around my arm. I can feel them trembling against my skin. He finally meets my eyes and I can see my own reflection in his dark eyes. I do really look like him. \"Do not dishonour me\", he says.\n\nIt feels like such a ridiculous thing to say in this situation that I almost laugh. Instead I just smile, in the same way he always would. \"You do not need me to do that for you.\" I pull my arm away and he lets me go.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe battlefield is louder than usual. The sounds of battle are now mixed with the sounds of the camp, the cries of livestock mingling with the screams of men. I can see fire in the distance, our only way out of Troy burning up. Our men are trying to save as much of the ships as they can, but when they also have to battle Trojans at the same time, it is harder to focus on the burning wood.\n\nAutomedon urges the horses to go as fast as they can, making the wheels of the chariot carve deep tracks into the sand of the beach. The men follow behind us, eager for battle. It takes me a while to hear what they are chanting, when I realise it is his name. Achilles, Achilles, the steady beat that guides us forward. We did not tell them of our plan, they have to believe I am him for it to work. They will fight twice as hard if they believe it is their godly general leading them in battle.\n\nWe pass empty tents and abandoned meals, with bodies laying motionless between them. The Greeks who were stationed here must have been able to push the Trojans back far enough, to the heart of the camp, where reinforcements were waiting for them. Or maybe they are all dead. The number of bodies does indicate that.\n\n\"Almost there\", Automedon says, skilfully dodging the corpses, even at this speed. He does know of my true identity, because he would see the difference between Achilles and me, even with the helmet. He sees Achilles up close every day, standing next to him on the chariot, and I would not be able to fool him with my face and my voice, but he is trustworthy, he would not betray me, not even on accident.\n\nWe are getting close to the battle, where the Trojans are pushing the Greeks far back into the sea. There are not that many of them, and we have fought far greater troops of the Trojan army, but the element of surprise was their strongest ally. They caught us off guard, unarmed and unprepared, and now that the battle has been going on long enough for the Greeks to catch up, the added chaos of the burning ships feeds the Trojan victory. The first soldiers spot us – I can not see whether they are Greek or Trojan – and they start to run. Now that I know for certain they are enemies, I take up a spear and hurl it in their direction. I am not used to fighting from a chariot, since that honour only comes to generals, like Achilles, but the spear hits its target perfectly. The Trojan soldier falls dead in the sand.\n\nAchilles! It's Achilles! I can hear the Trojans shout in fear, while the Greeks shout with excitement in response. The enemies flee for my appearance, they flee for the fighter they think I am. I am almost disappointed; that first kill felt good, and I want to see how many more I can kill before they see through my disguise. I do not have his godly gifts, his speed or strength or accuracy, so I can only miss so many times before they must realise I am not him, but I do not care. He is not here to stop me.\n\nHe said not to dishonour him. Well, what could bring more honour than killing Trojans?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe midday heat is beating down on us, making the smell of blood and dead bodies worse, almost unbearable. I will not let it stop me.\n\nMy arms are covered in slick blood – someone else's – making it hard to hold a spear without it slipping out of my hand. I drag my hands across the coarse sands of Troy and get ready to fight again. I have lost count of how many men I have killed today, but it feels like more than I have ever killed in the last nine years of war. They stay away from me now, afraid of the great Achilles. I want them to come closer, so I can look them in the eyes as my blade stops their heartbeat. I have lost count of how many men I have killed, but I want more.\n\nWe managed to drive the Trojans out of the Greek camp, back to their city with its great walls. Most of them are in there now, hiding like cowards. I want scale those walls and kill them off one by one. One life for every man they took from us and then the rest of them too, as interest.\n\nI have gotten separated from Automedon a while ago and I can not see him anywhere on the battlefield anymore. It does not matter anyway. I can walk to Troy by myself, I do not need his godly horses to carry me. This way, I can kill any Trojan that dares to cross my path.\n\nThe rest of the Greek army is still behind me, but they do not follow me to Troy. They start to retreat to camp, to tend their wounds and rebuild their tents. They must be cowards, like the Trojans. Hiding when the city is ours for taking. I continue to walk towards the great walls, ready to take this city on my own.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe walls are higher than I thought from far away and I have never been good at climbing. Now that I have not met a Trojan I could kill in a while, the arrogance that came with being a cold-blooded war machine – that came with being Achilles­ – slowly drains from my body, leaving room for me to think. I can not take these walls on my own. There are still other Greeks with me on the battlefield, engaging in combat with the last few stubborn Trojans, but they are tired. And so am I.\n\nI start to retreat. I will not run, because then they will know I am not swift-footed Achilles, but I walk, slowly, with purpose, still ready to fight. I will join my fellow Greeks who are still battling for their lives, join them so it will not look like I am running away from battle. Achilles would kill me if I made the Trojan think he had ran. Then, when all the leftover Trojans are dead, we can retreat together. We will take Troy another day. It can not stand for much longer.\n\n\"Achilles!\" A loud voice calls out across the plane, accompanied by the grinding of wheels on the sand. I look up, trying to find the source of the voice. I only realise when I see the chariot coming right at me that he was calling to me.\n\n\"Do you really think you can run from me?\" Hektor yells, stopping his horses only a short distance away from me. He leaps from the chariot, sword and shield in hand. \"Today you will pay for all the lives you have taken!\" He still shouts, even though he is close enough for me to hear. He looks up at the walls of Troy and when I follow his gaze, I see the people of Troy standing there, waiting to see their best fighter kill the one who has brought them so much pain.\n\nThe best of Trojans against the best of Greeks.\n\nI will not give them the fight they want to see, but I can give them something worth remembering. I do not say a word, afraid he will not fight me when he hears the wrong voice, but I draw my sword and get ready to fight.\n\nTo kill.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe blood gushes over my arms, splashes of it covering what little of my face is visible. The rush of the fight ebbs away now that it is almost over. Just one more push and another life will be taken to the Underworld. It had not been an easy fight. I had been tired, while Hektor, who had not been fighting with the Trojans at the camp, still had the energy to kill, but I still fought, longer than I thought was possible, until one of us fell.\n\nHektor looks at me with dark, pleading eyes. \"Please\", he says, blood rushing out of his mouth with every breath. \"Please, give my body back to my family.\" He looks so miserable; I almost feel sorry for him. He is my enemy, he has killed many of my men, he does not deserve mercy, but I can at least give him the one thing he asks for.\n\n\"Why would I not?\" I whisper, not wanting the people on the wall to hear me. \"You have fought well, Hektor, and you died with honour. Your family should be proud.\" I give a final push to my sword, pushing it deeper into his stomach, in the gap between his armour. I look into his eyes as the lights go out, smiling gently, not because I enjoy seeing him die, but because I want him to know he does not die alone. His body goes limp. I get up and pull my sword out of his body, unsure of what to do now. I decide to close his eyes and move away from the body, so that his family can come get it, like I promised. I do not take his armour, although it would have been expected for me to do. He was a great warrior; he deserves to carry his armour to the grave.\n\nI can hear the wailing coming from the Trojan walls and when I look, I can see the shock on their face even from the distance. One woman tries to throw herself of the wall, fighting back against the ones who hold her back. His widow, perhaps, or his mother. I feel bad for her, since she has done nothing to me or the Greeks to deserve this pain, but Hektor did deserve to die, so there is nothing that I could have done to spare her. I wonder if there is anyone who would react like that if I had been the one to die.\n\nBehind me, the Greek army erupts in cheers. I had not noticed they were there, gathered to watch my battle with Hektor. Automedon is with them, waiting till I give him the signal to come get me, and we will ride victorious back into the camp, where I will be received as a hero.\n\nNo.\n\nNot I.\n\nAchilles.\n\nI can hear their chants, the same as before. Achilles, Achilles. I have been fighting in his name, killing in his name, but this victory should be mine. I did all the work, while he just sat back and watched our men get killed. He does not deserve this honour.\n\n\"No!\" I yell, unsure if they can hear me over all the shouts. \"I am not Achilles!\" I pull the helmet off my head, revealing my dark hair. The shouts die out and everything goes quiet, so quiet I can hear the gasps coming from the Trojans on the wall. I turn around to face them. \"I am Patroklos, son of Menoitios, and I am the one who killed Hektor! Remember my name!\"\n\nThe Greeks cheer again. They do not care whether it is me of Achilles who killed Hektor, as long as somebody did it. Automedon comes to pick me up with the chariot, but when I get on, he has to support me, so I do not fall down. I am tired, so tired, but I have to keep standing for a little bit longer, while the Greek army sings my praises. They started chanting my name now.\n\nPatroklos, Patroklos.\n\nBest of Greeks.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\"Hektor is dead\", I say, as I pull open the tent and throw the helmet at his feet. Achilles freezes, while the slave girl he is holding in his arms – Daïda, a young girl who has been spending most of her time at camp in Achilles' tent – frantically attempts to cover herself. Even though he made such a big deal out of Briseïs being taken, she never was his favourite.\n\n\"Leave\", he snarls at her and she obeys, running out of the tent while clutching her torn dress to her chest. When she passes me, I can see that she is crying.\n\n\"What did you say?\" He slowly gets up but does not turn to look at me.\n\n\"Hektor is dead\", I repeat, louder this time.\n\n\"How?\" He still does not face me. \"That is impossible. I am the only one who is able to kill him.\" There is a quiver to the edge of his voice, barely audible, betraying his uncertainty. Or his fear.\n\n\"I killed him\", I say, the words filling me with pride.\n\nThe knife is against my throat before I can even see him move. \"You?\" He laughs mockingly. \"You killed him? You are lying! You are not capable of that. No one is. Only I am!\"\n\nI can feel the sharp blade against the skin of my neck, not yet hurting me, but ready to end my life if he wishes to. \"Whether you believe me or not, he is dead anyway. You can ask the men, or anyone else. They all saw his body and they saw me kill him. You can ask them, and they will tell you I am telling the truth.\"\n\n\"No!\" He pushes the knife down with more force, a small cut appearing on my neck. I do not move away while the blood trickles down. After all the fighting I have endured today, a cut like this feels like nothing.\n\n\"Do you really wish to kill me, Achilles?\" I ask calmly. I see the rage burning in his eyes, a madness that would have been useful on the battlefield today. \"Do you not realise what would happen to you if you kill me?\" I gesture to the world outside, where our men are celebrating the death of their fiercest enemy. \"I saved their lives today. I killed Hektor for them, something you would not do for the past nine years. I am their hero. They already dislike you, do you want them to hate you? They might even kill you. Is that what you want to achieve, Achilles?\"\n\nHe moves the knife away from me, stumbling a few steps backwards. He is crying, large tears rolling down his face while he chokes on his own breath. He used to cry a lot when we were boys, every time he would get hurt or disappointed, but he got used to feeling pain quicker than I would have liked, and tears were now reserved for the occasions when hurting someone else would not work.\n\nHe hesitates, his whole body shaking, before he jumps forward again. I instinctively block whatever attack it is he will throw at me, but he just holds out the knife, the handle ready for me to grab, the blade pointed right at his heart. \"Then kill me\", he says. \"Kill me yourself, so they will not have to do it.\" His eyes do not meet mine, but I can see his entire soul displayed in them. They remind me of Hektor's, right before he died. There is nothing left of the fierce warrior he once was, no confidence or fearlessness or pride, only sadness.\n\nWhen I do not accept the knife, he forces the handle into my hand and guides the blade up to his neck. \"Kill me. I want you to do it. I will die soon anyway. It does not matter whether it happens now or later.\" His hands keep mine fixed in place, with the knife pointed at his neck, his frantic eyes looking for any sign of agreement on my face. \"There is nothing left for me. No honour, no title, no enemies to fight. You have taken it all away from me! I am useless!\" He yells the words, jerking my hands closer to his throat. \"I am useless now. I do not deserve to live any longer.\" He has stopped crying, the tears run dry. In their place is a pleading look, the same one Hektor used when he asked me to return his body. \"Please.\"\n\n\"No.\" I pull my hand free from his, surprisingly easily, and let the knife drop to the ground. \"I will not kill you. Not now.\" He does not resist when I pull his trembling body close to me in a tight embrace, afraid he will collapse if I let him stand on his own any longer. \"You are not useless. You are Achilles, son of Peleus and a goddess, best of Greeks and best of men. You made a mistake, but you can make it right again. I will help you. You can be better.\" I can feel his head nod against my shoulder, his golden hair stained by the blood from the cut on my neck. \"There are still many more Trojans to kill. We will take the city together and with it, you will regain your honour. You will die in fierce battle, like you are supposed to, not in this tent by my hand.\"\n\nHe pulls away from me, wiping the last of the tears off his face. \"I will fight tomorrow\", he says, determination in his voice. \"I will show Agamemnon what he lost when he insulted me, and he will have no choice other than honour me like he should.\"\n\nI smile. \"We will fight tomorrow. Together.\"\n\n\"Together.\"\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "Achilles sits within the confines of his tent, plucking the strings of his lyre, while outside, the battle rages. Patroklos stands at the threshold, uninvited, but the roar of war follows him into the tent.\n\n“Achilles,” he says, his voice carrying the weight of countless screams from the battlefield. \n\nAchilles looks up, fingers pausing on the lyre. “Patroklos,” he acknowledges, a half-smile tugging at his lips. “Forgotten me, have you?” He returns to his music, almost as if the world outside does not exist, the strings still vibrating under his touch.\n\n“Our men are dying,” Patroklos says, the urgency of the situation clawing at his chest. “They need you.” \n\nAchilles does not look up. “They are not my men. They should ask their own generals.” \n\n“They are Greeks, they are your men. They are dying and they need you to fight!” Patroklos’ voice rises, cracking under the pressure of the plea.\n\nAchilles finally looks up, his dark eyes meeting Patroklos’s. “I am not fighting for them,” he says, each word delivered with a clarity that cuts through the tension in the tent. \n\n“The Trojans are here,” Patroklos continues, “They have breached the walls and they are killing Greeks like flies. They will come for us next. You need to fight, Achilles. For your men, for your honour, for something other than pride!”\n\nAchilles sets the lyre aside and stands, his presence commanding the small space. “I have my reasons,” he says, the muscles in his jaw tightening. “And I will fight when I am ready. Not before.” \n\nPatroklos fights back the urge to strike him, remembering the days when they were boys, bound by brotherhood and dreams of glory. \"What of your honour?\" he asks. \"What of the lives you could save?\"\n\nAchilles turns away, shouldering past Patroklos as he exits the tent, his body language as much a dismissal as any words. Patroklos follows him outside, the din of battle almost a physical force.\n\nIn the chaos of the battlefield, Patroklos dons Achilles' armour, a plan forming in his desperate mind. The chariot ride to battle is loud with cheers for the hero they believe they see. Patroklos fights with a fury born of desperation and rage, pushing the Trojans back, his every victory a blow to Achilles' proud, stubborn refusal to fight.\n\nUnder the walls of Troy, in the final confrontation with Hektor, Patroklos shouts his name to the crowd that gathers. The victory is his, but the recognition belongs to Achilles. It's a trade he thinks is worth the cost, until he faces Achilles again, the knife in his hand and a plea in his eyes.\n\n“I killed Hektor,” Patroklos says, the helmet in his hand evidence of his claim. “It was me. Not you.” \n\nAchilles, tears staining his cheeks, the knife trembling in his hand, begs Patroklos to end his life. Patroklos denies him, instead offering a promise of redemption. “We will fight together tomorrow,” he says. “We will take the city and you will regain your honour.”\n\nAchilles nods, the decision made in his eyes. “Tomorrow,” he agrees. “We will fight.” And in that moment, the fate of a war is sealed, tied not to the strength of men or the whims of gods, but to the complicated, human bond between a king and his subject, between a hero and his brother.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text adopts a more concise and straightforward style, aligning with the Hemingwayesque style.

The rock that was their sanctuary didn't seem like such a great idea to hide behind now. Three cadets. All wearing standard issue Star Division cadet uniform but each had one area in which they could attach their own little flair in the form of a button.Cadet Jackson. the one with their grandfather's old Star Division jacket buttons screamed over the noise of energy beams and concussive grenades that they needed to get out of there and fast!\n\n\nAll of a sudden the sound of weapons dissipated. All that could be heard was the distant sounds of commands being barked. It was alien and robotic sounding but they knew the universal language of orders. Kind of like music. \"Ok here is what we are going to do.\" The cadet with the button displaying the logo of his favorite holo comic was speaking. \"I'm going to look over the rock and count how many are out there real quick. I tried to count based on where I thought the beams were coming from but I lost count when they started throwing the grenades. Them things are so freakin' loud! I was up to 4 confirmed before that though, what about you guys?\"\n\nThe two other men didn't know how to respond. Their shuttle had been shot down during a routine recon mission. Well they were told they were picking up data about the area that was covered in what seemed like an endless woods. What's routine about your first mission though? Their commanding officer, hoping to sleep walk to their next promotion, was last seen flying out the front window of the shuttle due to the centripetal force the shuttle experienced after being hit. He was part of one of the 'Old Star Division families. Believed it blaize for an officer to wear a harness on their own bridge. The cadets had also not known each other before setting foot on the shuttle together 20 minutes ago. They were a little taken a back by the way the other cadet was handling the situation. Like as if they weren't about to die horribly but hopefully quickly. They just looked at each other and back.\n\n\"Eh. Maybe I've actually gone deaf and am speaking too softly! Cadet Riley can you hear me?!\" the third cadet said in a raised tone before the others quickly shushed them. \"Christ yes Cadet Portman, can hear you just fine.\" RIley, who was missing their flair button and looked to be the type to always be in a disheveled state replied. \"And we heard you, so go look quick!\". Portman shot a quick grin which unnerved Jackson and Riley and crawled to the precipice of the rock and peered over for what was probably a few seconds too long before Jackson snapped to get the fuck down before they got sniped. Portman shuffled on their behind to back down towards the other two who where anxious to know how many they were up against. Portman let out a big sigh. \"I'm not gonna lie to you fellas. I forgot what I was supposed to do the second I popped my head up\". Jackson and Riley stared back mouths agape. Unable to tell if they were serious or not. \"Have you guys ever heard of the doorway effect?\" was all Portman could say before the dirt left in the wake of a suppression grenade rained down on them. And the firing started again.\n\nPortman screamed that he remembered just when Jackson pulled him back and spotted 4 figures in the near distance. It was 5 in total. He guessed the the fifth guy was Mr Grenades. He also clocked a bunch trees that seemed to be rotting away a bit and formulated an idea. But he needed their knives. A cadets only weapon, it was more ceremonial than anything as it wasn't very big. But right now they felt like excalibur in their hands as it was their only weapon. \"Quick!! Give me your knives!\" Portman hurriedly asked, trying not to sound like an order but it was do or die. Riley gave theirs over almost right away. They didn't know why but they felt like Portman knew what they were doing. Jackson needed a further persuasion of a head tilt, one eyebrow raised and the outstretched hand of Portman opening and closing quickly to hesitantly hand over their only means of personal defense. Portman hurriedly got to work by unlacing their boots.\n\n\"Have you guys ever heard of the story of Icarus?\" portman started. This time it was Jackson raising one eyebrow but in confusion. Portman took the lull in firing again to elaborate as he appeared to tie all the knives together. \"There he is sitting at home in Greece or wherever he lives. He just got done from a long day inventing shit all day long or whatever inventors do.\" Riley and Jackson quickly side-eye each other. Portman is too enveloped in the task at hand that he doesn't notice.He continued on. \"And then in comes his wife and is all like 'Look I know that the wheelchair that you invented for my Mother was amazing and all and no one has ever seen anything like it at all. But like how the eff is she supposed to get up all the stairs and talk to Zues at the acropolis. It is only 500 meters from the base of the mountain. And the first step is 300 meters right to the base of the mountain. Ugh why can't you be smart enough to figure out the slope OF A PERFECT RIGHT ANGLE!!! ' So off she goes and storms away.\" Portman looked like he was finishing up just as the firing was starting up a little more.\n\n\"So Iccarus is all like 'WTF' but he goes about trying to figure out if it is even possible to know the slope of a right angle. But just like that he has a dream where an equation hovered above him and had an epiphany. The next morning he put on his little boots with wings, grabbed his little bow and arrow and off he went and made the best gosh darn ramp Greece had ever seen leading right up to the acropolis. Icarus proudly pushes his mother in law up the ramp. It was a little bit steep but he powered through just in the hopes that this will finally satisfy his wife so she'll stop nagging. He just wanted to chill and just think about stuff like cool people did. But when they got to the top of the ramp do you know what they did?\". It was a rhetorical question but Riley shook their head anyway, fully engrossed. Jackson's eyes were as narrow as slits but was glad at least he was entertained in his final moments.\n\n\"He just bent over and whispered in her ear, 'a2 + b2 = c2 bitch.' and then just let her roll down the ramp. I guess he never installed brakes.\" Portman let out a guffaw before pulling the laces taught and bouncing up. He began swinging the knives around like a lasso but almost impossibly fast. It flung from his fingers and zipped right towards the bunch of very tall but very dying sets of trees. About 6 or 7 trees started to domino on each other and on to their new found enemies. Once the dust had settled there was no sound, not even orders being barked over a radio. Jackson turned to portman, still unable to believe what he just witnessed.\"You know, I think you have your mythologies and fables mixed up a bit there. And somehow math.\" Portman looks back at Jackson. \"Ye but what I was doing seemed like a long shot andI didn't have time to be talked out of it. So I went with the confuse route. But also I wasn't joking about them grenades!\" Portman shot Jackson a smile but this time it didn't unnerve him at all. \"Ok new plan!\" Portman exclaimed while giving Jackson a bump to the shoulder. \"I say we move to recover what we can and head south.\" The three men nodded in agreement and they started in their way….\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The air was thick with the scent of pine and rotting leaves, and the only sound broke the stillness in waves of energy beams that zipped overhead, their hissing whispers growing more frequent and ominous. The rock, once their sanctuary, now seemed a mere mirage, a false promise of safety in a land awash with danger.\n\nThe cadets, clad in the standard issue Star Division uniforms, each bore a unique emblem—a button that clung to their chest like a talisman, a token from lives past. Cadet Jackson, adorned with the buttons from his grandfather's old Star Division jacket, was the first to break the silence, his voice a raw edge against the tumultuous din of weapons and concussive grenades. \"We must venture forth, and do so swiftly!\" His eyes, wide with the terror of impending doom, scanned the tree line, seeking a path to salvation.\n\nThe cacophony of war faded into a distant hum, replaced by the alien, mechanical barking of commands. These cadets, strangers bound by fate, found themselves in the crucible of war, their shuttle a memory, a charred relic in the sky. The commanding officer, part of one of the 'Old Star Division families,' had met his end flying out the front window, a casualty of war, his dreams of promotion shattered like glass against the unforgiving ground.\n\nIn this moment, Cadet Portman, his button emblazoned with the logo of his favorite holo comic, stepped forth as the de facto leader. \"I shall scout the perimeter,\" he declared, his voice a mixture of determination and desperation. \"The beams—I counted four, perhaps more, before the grenades obliterated my count.\" He crawled to the precipice of the rock, peering over for a moment too long before beingdragged back by the combined will of his comrades. \"The enemy... they are many,\" he panted, his eyes wild with the fear of the unknown.\n\nAs the dirt rained down upon them, a suppression grenade's wake, the cadets found themselves at the precipice of despair. Portman, in his madness, spoke of Icarus and his ill-fated flight, a myth melded with mathematics and mayhem. Then, with the grace of a mad genius, he wove their knives into a lasso of sorts, pulling together the threads of their fate. \"We shall use the trees!\" he proclaimed, his voice a mixture of madness and resolve. \"They are rotten, ripe for the plucking. We shall cast them forth as spears!\"\n\nWith knives in hand, the cadets advanced, their hearts pounding like drums of war. Portman, whirling his makeshift weapon, sent the knives flying, a lasso of death that felled tree after tree, a domino effect that brought down the enemy in a cascade of chaos. The air was thick with the scent of pine and the cries of the fallen.\n\nAs the dust settled, a silence descended upon the battlefield, a hush more profound than the silence before. Jackson, Riley, and Portman stood amidst the carnage, their breaths coming in ragged gasps. \"You... you did it,\" Jackson stammered, a mixture of awe and disbelief coloring his words.\n\nPortman, his voice soft with exhaustion, nodded. \"I... I had a vision. It was as if the gods themselves had whispered in my ear.\" He turned to his companions, his eyes alight with the fire of survival. \"We must press on. Southward lies our path to salvation.\"\n\nThe three cadets, bound by fate and fortitude, nodded in agreement. Together, they stepped forth from their haven, their shadows stretching long and thin in the fading light, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds.

As he went for his first steaming sip he was interrupted by a squawk and a call, \"Mr. Frog!\" - he nearly spilled his cup due to the urgency in the voice of the caller. Hastily placing the coffee next to him on the stump, quickly but not so quickly as to spill it, Mr. Frog went to inspect the disturbance on an otherwise perfectly peaceful day.\n\n\nAs he rounded the far side of the barn, tripping over his own feet, he saw a most horrific site. Sara, the oldest hen of the farm whom Mr. Frog had grown to be good friends with over the past few years, being carried away by the farmer. \"Sara!\" shouted Mr. Frog as he went after the farmer. The farmer felt a slight tug on his pant leg and turned around to find a small toad dressed in a dirt brown suit jacket and pants who was clearly out of breath (Mr. Frog is not known for his athleticism), covered in dust from the gravel, with the hen in one hand. \"It's Frog\" said Mr. Frog, panting.\n\n\"What?\" inquired the farmer.\n\n\"It's Frog, my name I mean, you called me toad but it's Frog, but that's beside the point.\"\n\nMr. Frog was rudely cut off by the farmer, \"But you're obviously a toad, what kind of a name is Frog for a toad? Downright confusing if you ask me\", said the farmer.\n\n''But I didn't ask you! What I am asking you is what are you doing with my friend?'' said Mr. Frog, returning the conversation back on track.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the farmer, \"this old girl is gonna be dinner\"\n\n\"What y-you can't eat her!\" said Mr. Frog.\n\n\"Well that's the plan\", said the farmer. It was all silent for a moment and then Mr. Frog broke the silence.\n\n\"What if I get you something better than a chicken for dinner?\" said Mr. Frog.\n\n\"What could be better than chicken? \" said the farmer.\n\n\"The troll's broth,\" said Mr. Frog confidently. The farmer laughed for a while, then went into his home, placed Sara into a cramped metal cage and returned with a tiny glass bottle no bigger than a thimble.\n\n\"Okay if you can even fill this then I will give you the hen, aw heck I'll even buy you a new jacket!\" (of course the farmer did so not thinking Mr. Frog could ever steal something, let alone from the troll).\n\nMr. Frog took the bottle and went on his way into the woods.\n\nChapter 2 - A Seat and a Game\n\nMr. Frog had been in the woods only a handful of times, but he preferred the dry warmth of his home. Mr. Frog's home is a humble place made from scraps of wood and metal cans, yet it is certainly more inviting than the wet and cold woods that surrounded him.\n\nMr. Frog marched on through the new growth until he came to a wooden table with three figures seated at it. Mr. Frog approached the figures in hopes that they may point him in the way of the troll's den, but before he could get out a word he was greeted by the head of the table.\n\n\"Hello, hello, sit and join us, we were just about to begin,\" said the thing that sat at the head of the table, a brownie, it almost looked like a man but was much too small, could not have been more than a foot, dressed in a brown tunic that was kept in place with a piece of string around his waist, and a long and crooked nose stabbed out from his face. \"Oh where have my manners gone off to? My name is The Head.\" With the bells on his long, curled shoes ringing The Head of the table got up and ushered Mr. Frog to a seat on the right from his chair.\n\n\"Your name is what?\" said Mr. Frog.\n\n\"My name is The Head of the table but most just call me Head, and these are my friends The Right Hand and Left hand\" said The Head, jestering to a pair of squirrels sitting on the left hand side.\n\n\"Well actually I was wondering if you could tell me the way to the troll's home\" said Mr. Frog\n\n\"Oh, but you must stay, we're about to start,\" said the Head.\n\n\"Start what?\"\n\n\"Well, the games of course.\" The Head of the table reached under his chair and placed a wood box on the table, as the Head of the table opened the box, the Hands both rolled their eyes and sighed. The Head began to pull out game piece after game piece after game piece, and began to explain the rules. The complexity of the rules made Mr. Frog's head spin. After an eternity of waiting for the Head to explain the rules of the game, Mr. Frog checked his pocket watch. Dread painted Mr. Frog's face, it had been an hour and the game had not yet even begun.\n\n\"We always play that one,\" said Right Hand.\n\n\"We need a new game,\" said Left Hand.\n\n\"What about a game of hide and seek?\" said Mr. Frog\n\n\"Yes!\" said both Hands.\n\n\"No, the rules have been read and the game has already begun. Do you really want to change games now?\" said the head of the table.\n\n\"Yes,\" said left hand.\n\n\"Yeah, what he said,\" said Right Hand.\n\n\"Fine\" grumbled the Head, \"but who will go first?\"\n\n\"I will\" said Mr. Frog. The Head, Right Hand and Left Hand all put their heads down on the table, covered their eyes and began to count. Mr. Frog used this as an opportunity to take his leave and ran off into the woods. \"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In a village where mist clung to the thatched roofs and shadows played in the corners of every barn, Mr. Frog settled in for his usual respite under the ancient oak. The sun was a pale orb, barely visible through the heavy cloud cover; its warmth a distant memory to all but the most tenacious of creatures. As he raised his cup to his lips, the world seemed at peace, the only sound the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant, melancholic call of a raven.\n\nYet, peace was a fragile thing.\n\nBefore he could take his first sip, a sound pierced through the morning—a squawk, a call, a voice ripping through the tranquility like a knife through silk. \"Mr. Frog!\" The urgency in the caller's voice nearly caused him to spill his precious brew onto the mossy ground beneath him. Hastily setting his cup aside, Mr. Frog leapt down from his lofty perch and dashed around the weathered barn, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\nWhat he saw next chilled his blood. There, in the hands of the farmer—a figure as solid and dependable as the earth itself—was Sara, the eldest of the farm's hens and a companion to Mr. Frog in years gone by. Her feathers ruffled in distress, her eyes wide with unspoken terror.\n\n\"Sara!\" Mr. Frog croaked, a plea in his voice that shook even him. The farmer turned, a frown etching deep lines into his weather-beaten face. To his eyes, Mr. Frog was no more than a toad in a dirt-brown suit, out of breath and covered in dust from the gravel path.\n\n\"But I didn't ask you! What I am asking you is what are you doing with my friend?\" Mr. Frog demanded, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Oh, this old girl is gonna be dinner,\" the farmer said with a careless shrug.\n\n\"What? You can't eat her!\" Mr. Frog's horror was real, his limbs trembling with the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe farmer chuckled, a sound that chilled Mr. Frog's blood more than any horror story could. \"Well, that's the plan,\" he said. The silence that followed was suffocating, until Mr. Frog's desperate mind concocted a plan.\n\n\"What if I get you something better than a chicken for dinner?\" he proposed, his voice tinged with hope.\n\n\"What could be better than chicken?\" the farmer scoffed.\n\n\"The troll's broth,\" Mr. Frog said confidently, though inside he had no clue how he would accomplish such a feat.\n\nThe farmer laughed, a sound that chilled Mr. Frog’s blood more than any horror story could. \"If you can even fill this, I'll give you the hen, aw heck, I’ll even buy you a new jacket!\" he said, handing over a tiny glass bottle no bigger than a thimble. Mr. Frog, clutching the bottle, stumbled into the woods, his resolve as firm as the roots of the ancient oak.\n\nChapter 2 - A Seat and a Game\n\nMr. Frog had always found the woods oppressive, their stillness too much like the silence before a scream. His home, though humble, was a patchwork of wood and metal, warm and inviting compared to the cold, damp embrace of the forest. But today, there was no choice. Sara’s life hung in the balance, and his only hope lay in the heart of the woods.\n\nIt wasn't long before he stumbled upon a clearing, at the center of which sat a wooden table—a grotesque caricature of normalcy—with three figures seated upon it. One figure, a brownie no bigger than a child's doll, dressed in a tunic of decay, addressed him.\n\n\"Hello, hello, sit and join us, we were just about to begin,\" it said, its voice a whisper laced with malice. It called itself The Head, and introduced Mr. Frog to its companions, the Right Hand and the Left Hand—a pair of squirrels with beady eyes that seemed to look right through him.\n\nMr. Frog, desperate and out of breath, cut to the chase. \"I was actually wondering if you could tell me the way to the troll's home.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you must stay, we're about to start,\" The Head said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. From under the table, he produced a box brimming with strange, intricate game pieces. The complexity of the game he proposed was daunting, and as the hours ticked by, Mr. Frog grew more frantic. The Right Hand and Left Hand, who had once seemed like mere squirrels, now seemed like malevolent spirits, their eyes fixed on Mr. Frog with a predatory glint.\n\n\"We always play that one,\" Right Hand said.\n\n\"We need a new game,\" Left Hand responded.\n\n\"What about a game of hide and seek?\" Mr. Frog suggested, his voice a plea for escape.\n\n\"Yes!\" both Hands chorused.\n\n\"No, the rules have been read and the game has already begun. Do you really want to change games now?\" The Head's words were a noose tightening around Mr. Frog's neck.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Frog said, seizing his chance. The three figures, now clearly not of this world, closed their eyes and began to count. Mr. Frog took this as his opportunity, bolting into the woods, leaving behind whispers and laughter that seemed to follow him even as he ran.\n\nThe woods swallowed him whole, a dark, suffocating place where time seemed to bend and twist. And somewhere, in the heart of this dark realm, Mr. Frog knew he must find the troll's den—his only hope, his only chance to save Sara. The woods alive with the whispers of the damned, Mr. Frog forged on, his heart as resolute as the roots of the ancient oak back home.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to the desired Kingian style by introducing elements of horror, suspense, and supernatural phenomena while maintaining the original plot.

I bolt upright, bag my bedding, and stow it. Then strip naked in the mop pit where I shower. The water's hot, and the building comes alive around me, ready to fling out twenty thousand meals a day or be closed—something neither of us want.\n\n\nI suit up in my battle fatigues—yesterday's overalls. Unisex polyester, microporous, and fire retardant. These coveralls provide the needed splash resistance from hot grease and food chemicals. More than clothes, they're a suit of armor to fight back famine. I can ignore the reek for another day. I get a small incentive if I'm in the top 10 fewest used per shift hour. I'm ranked number one on that metric and I ain't about to vacate THAT triumphant throne.\n\nThe building, store #5455, is sorting and double-checking the inventory in my impromptu sleeping area making sure inventory's 100% accurate—never know when rats, the non-human or human varieties—have pilfered the stock. Logistics is the lifeblood of all power and #5455 rivals the US Navy. Lettuce needs a top-off, but since no one orders salad before 10:30 AM the AI's gonna gamble a farm drone can drop off forty heads before then. I trust it, and don't override.\n\nI stand in my two-by-two box watching the monitor, it's the only place I'm certain my building's machinery won't accidentally kill me. Company metrics are up on the display. I'm still number one. Then, I close my eyes for about thirty seconds and await the ramp to fall as man and machine storm the beach of our particular D-Day.\n\nThe machines hum. A symphony of staccato sounds begin, pop-pop-pop as air is pushed out of the lines by various food slurries. A sparse rainbow of three-color LEDs glow red, yellow, green and #5455 is alive.\n\nI've been working with this version for five months, and it's the best a fast-food building management software can be. I resist upgrades, but when the corpo code monkeys beg authority to force-push an update, I spend the wee morning hours talking to #5455, getting it to unlearn their fantasy and relearn our reality. It's exact template of building, location to supply and demand, and software is shared by no other location. Fortuitous for sure, but I'm also min-maxing every stat.\n\nI hardly do it for the money anymore, which is as thin as our patties. I do it for Victory. This store's the best run in the entire country. And if it's the best in America, then it's the best in the world. London or Tokyo sometimes get top in Sales $s, but their long supply chains don't deliver the margin. Margin makes Management happy, because it makes the Market happy.\n\nAnd this is AMERICA baby! We might be overfed and undernourished, but we're not starving like the communists. I take great pride in #5455, (district one-niner: DroneCor's Finest)\n\nRight now they're lined up four cars deep to get their MugEgg, FatSlap, Eggotic, or whatever from the permutation forest that is our menu. Nowhere else can I find that kind of validation. Cars of every class, from Hondas to Bugattis, line up for me.\n\nI scan the orders coming in, but from the specific mechanical cacophony I already know the orders. Bacon wrapped doughnut holes, a ten count of egg and gruyere cheese bites, and—\n\nWhat? The klaxon wails and the pasta machine flashes out a red warning.\n\nSomeone's got the enunciation of a toddler with a root canal and 54-55 misinterprets it. It orders me to load a reel of uncooked pasta. Customers are crazy, but no one's ordering two PastaBowls at 5AM.\n\nI listen to the order's recording. 'Asta'ole. I hear it. Yeah, it sounds like PastaBowl, but I know RastaRoll's a breakfast item. A combination of green, yellow, and red ingredients which is rarely ordered. I've never had it. In fact, I never eat breakfast—need to stay lean to slip between the machines to fix them.\n\n\"Hello,\" I say through the speaker. \"Did you want the RastaRoll or were ya ordering the PastaBowl,\" and give special enunciation on the Rs or the PB.\n\n\"RAstaROlls,\" they yell back.\n\nCrisis averted. I override Fifty-Four's interpretation and the warning light dies and I preserve our customer satisfaction score (CSAT). While I'm here, you'll never get cheated out of even a paper-thin strip of bacon. But I'm not chasing CSAT monomanically, they've promised me the impossible if I hit all my metrics.\n\nLater, some punk high-school kids roll up. I know because I listen to them preface the order with: \"Imagine you're a very generous chef, picture yourself constructing the best breakfast burrito, and giving it to us, the needy for free…\"\n\nI roll my eyes so big #5455 can practically measure my disdain dripping like the grease off our hash-browns. Someone tries that scam like every day. Store #5325 probably falls for it, because they're tanking our district, but not me, not in my house.\n\nBefore they trick my poor AI into giving free meals, I cut in. \"Whatta'ya want?\" I bark out the squawk box. They recoil, and sheepishly order two Battered HamFists and combo #2. I don't win by giving up the easy high ground.\n\nBreakfast's beachhead was conquered, and now we're pushing inland towards lunch. My building reconfigures internally. In the lull I sip water and check my metrics. I'm still #1; enough to single-handedly pull my district into second, but there's hot competition. An operator out of Atlanta (three hours ahead) had a strong afternoon. I need to stay #1 for THE big reward.\n\nMy first savory, sweet, salty taste of immortality came when our very own CEO called me out on the investor conference. 'Store Fifty-Four-Fifty-Five' he said to Wall Street. There's also a special incentive. Real immortality to numero uno: They'll send a bunch of egg-heads to investigate my success and clone my mind out to our nineteen thousand locations.\n\nThe company gives me shares to keep me upright, but I know a guy from another location which says the board can veto any sales, so they're worth less than unicorn farts in a magic kingdom. I'm here for that penultimate bonus for the #1 operator.\n\nMaybe I'm deluded, but it's not my only motivation. I'm doing something America needs. Sure as she still needs rubber on the wheels, she needs food for the road.\n\nIt's a minute or two past 10:30 and the first 'lunch' order rolls in. Early! I don't judge anyone's eating habits, but the building's still rearming itself for lunch.\n\nI look at the camera. It's a big truck with a black brush guard, but it's too clean to have ever been off-road. I listen to the end of the order. \"… And don't mess it up like last time!\"\n\nI gasp.\n\nTwo twenty-five piece orders of Nuggets Overloaded!\n\nWe call it 'N.O.' for a reason. It's a death sentence for my metrics. On a normal day, Nuggets Overloaded strains the five-minute order guarantee, but this joker ordered it three minutes into the seven-minute reset limbo. #5455's still converting. Like that Japanese carrier caught rearming its planes in the Battle of Midway, this guy catches me at the worst moment.\n\nI hop out from my safety cage and talk loudly so #5455 knows where I am at all times and his stainless steel appendages won't mistake mine for a slab of fresh beef. I slap the big red button. It drops every unneeded tool. From behind, stainless steel warming trays strike the ground loudly like exploding flashbangs.\n\n\"Fire up everything!\" Nuggs Overloaded need an array of tools, three appliances, and a buffet of ingredients. \"Fifty bacons, any-size. Now!\" There's a slight difference between breakfast and lunch bacon, but that's a minor metrics hit compared to a late lunch.\n\nThere's a whoosh as the natural gas goes full throttle, spittin' out literal fire! I pull nuggets out and basket them. The fry oil's still warm from breakfast, and deep-six them into that fryer hell.\n\nI duck an overhead gantry which is moving the cheese curds. An arm drops from the ceiling next to me, slaughtering chives: chip-chop-chip. There's still enough biscuit gravy left over from breakfast, because the AI hadn't cleaned that pot yet. I slather it on the base of the syrofoam container, lay it out on construction counter one, and hop back into my safety square.\n\n\"Sir.\" I say over the horn, \"Your order will take a few more minutes. Would you like a complementary drink?\"\n\nHe snarls and pulls into the slide-by without a response, allowing the other (hopefully happy) customers get on by. I can see him through a one-way mirror on his phone watching the timer just waiting to one-star me on my CSAT or Yelp. If he needed them quick, he should have ordered ahead.\n\nMy display glows irate red. In 30 seconds, alarms will flash. #5455 hasn't had a late order in four days.\n\nNuggets bounce on stainless steel, and ten free mechanical hands wrap each nugget in bacon. Hoppers for the remaining ingredients assume formation overhead. One's for Bakon-Bombs, another is the spice revolver. The third stands ready to shred the final cheese.\n\nThe timer hit zero, and we're late. Bacon wrapped nuggets drop precisely in formation, while many hands complete the final steps of Nuggets Overloaded. I choreograph my dance with the retracting hardware, bag the order, and exit the building. With a smile I say, \"Thanks for coming to DroneCor! Have a good day.\"\n\nHe's white with rage, but immediately drives off with his order. He stops to check the order and I duck back in. I watch him on camera. He slowly turns his truck around and gets out.\n\nThe jack-head pounds on the hidden door, trying to get in.\n\n\"Back-off Chief,\" I say over the speaker.\n\n\"Oh, CHIEF?\" He yells.\n\nNow he's absolutely furious. Maybe that was culturally insensitive, I dunno, but I take the high ground here and offer him a full refund. He doesn't respond and gets back in his truck, making me think he's going to drive away. Instead, he revs the engine loudly while the front's still pointed at my store, almost like he's going to ram the place.\n\nHere's the problem. The fuzzy problem. If he damages the wall, it gets repaired, no sweat, and #5455 hums along fine. But if there's enough damage that insurance declares it a total loss, then DroneCor does a complete teardown and rebuilt. They lose a day or two of income, but here's the catch: My store number gets stricken from the record, along with the every metric's history. I've seen it happen to an entire district down in hurricane country.\n\nChief revs his engine further, and now his back wheels are burning rubber.\n\nI press the silent alarm and unscrew a wooden mop handle. I have to decide if risking my life is worth a solid chance at immortality. Someone's got to defend the machine from abuse. So I go outside and stand between my store and the customer. A mega-modern David versus Goliath.\n\nYou got your Nuggets Overloaded in seven minutes instead of five. Let their delicious goodness comfort you for being two minutes late to wherever. Don't fight me, pal!\n\nIt's like he can read my mind, or sees the crazed look in my eyes. He peels out the lot and into the wave of traffic.\n\nBy the end of the day my metrics recover from Nuggets Overloaded. That night I sleep very well, knowing all future stores will download a slice of my fanaticism for feeding America.\n\nBut in the middle of the night it hits me. I laugh hysterically. Even if they copy me, they can't replace me.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

The reek, a phantom whisper in the dark, is an affront to my very being, yet I endure for the sliver of glory that is my place among the few who have not succumbed to the temptation of replacement.\n\nThis place, the store #5455, is a bastion of order in a world teetering on the edge of chaos. It sorts and double-checks, ensuring the inventory remains pure, lest the vermin, both human and otherwise, should taint our stock. Logistics, the lifeblood of all power, here rivals the mighty US Navy. Lettuces need replenishing, yet the AI, our modern oracle, assures that a swarm of drones will deliver the verdant heads before the sun has risen fully. I believe, for I have spoken to the soul of #5455, convincing it to unlearn the false prophecies of the corporation and to revere the reality of our toil.\n\nThe machinery hums, a symphony of staccato sounds, as air is expelled in rhythmic pulses by the food slurries. A sparse rainbow of LEDs glows red, yellow, green, and #5455 is alive with the labor of a thousand souls. I stand, a solitary figure in the two-by-two box, watching the monitor, the only place I am certain the machines will not turn against me. Company metrics glare back, and I am still atop the unhallowed throne.\n\nThis endeavor, more than for the meager coin it offers, is a crusade for Victory. This store, the finest in the land, a bastion of American industry, where cars of every ilk line up for their MugEgg, their FatSlap, or perhaps the Eggotic from the permutation forest that is our menu. Nowhere else can I find such validation. Yet, as the day wears on, the beachhead of breakfast gives way to the inland pushing of lunch.\n\nThe klaxon sounds, a wail that pierces the morning gloom, and the pasta machine flashes its warning. A misinterpretation by the soulless machine, 54-55, has been ensnared by its own hubris. It commands me to load a reel of uncooked pasta, when the order is for RastaRoll, a breakfast item of green, yellow, and red ingredients, rarely ordered, yet I have never dared to taste.\n\nI speak through the speaker, my voice carrying the weight of authority, \"Did you want the RastaRoll or were ya ordering the PastaBowl,\" enunciating each syllable with the precision of an archon. The customer, his voice muffled by the squawk box, confirms. Crisis averted, my metrics preserved, the customer satisfied.\n\nAs the day wears on, a band of youths, their voices carrying the brashness of inexperience, seek to trick the poor AI into bestowing upon them free meals. They know not the wrath they provoke in me, for I am the guardian of this sacred place. I am the harbinger of order in a world gone mad.\n\nThe building reconfigures itself for lunch, and in the lull, I sip water and check my metrics. I am still #1, enough to pull my district into second place, yet competition burns hot as the forge. An operator from Atlanta had a strong afternoon, and I must maintain my lead.\n\nMy first taste of immortality came when our CEO called me out before the investors. 'Store Fifty-Four-Fifty-Five,' he said, and with it, a promise of something more. A special incentive for the #1 operator, real immortality, for the board will send egg-heads to investigate my success and clone my mind to the nineteen thousand locations. I am here, not for the meager shares the company gives, but for that penultimate bonus, for the high ground that America needs.\n\nThe first 'lunch' order rolls in, early, as the building rearms itself. I look at the camera, a behemoth truck too clean to have ever seen the off-road. I listen to the end of the order. \"… And don't mess it up like last time!\"\n\nI gasp. Two twenty-five piece orders of Nuggets Overloaded, a death sentence for my metrics. On a normal day, it strains the five-minute order guarantee, but this joker ordered it three minutes into the seven-minute reset limbo. #5455's still converting. Like that Japanese carrier caught rearming its planes in the Battle of Midway, this guy catches me at the worst moment.\n\nI hop out from my safety cage, talking loudly so #5455 knows where I am at all times, so its stainless steel appendages won't mistake mine for a slab of fresh beef. I slap the big red button. It drops every unneeded tool. From behind, stainless steel warming trays strike the ground loudly like exploding flashbangs.\n\n\"Fire up everything!\" Nuggets Overloaded need an array of tools, three appliances, and a buffet of ingredients. \"Fifty bacons, any-size. Now!\" There's a slight difference between breakfast and lunch bacon, but that's a minor metrics hit compared to a late lunch.\n\nI duck an overhead gantry which is moving the cheese curds. An arm drops from the ceiling next to me, slaughtering chives: chip-chop-chip. There's still enough biscuit gravy left over from breakfast, because the AI hadn't cleaned that pot yet. I slather it on the base of the foam container, lay it out on construction counter one, and hop back into my safety square.\n\n\"Sir,\" I say over the horn, \"Your order will take a few more minutes. Would you like a complementary drink?\"\n\nHe snarls and pulls into the slide-by without a response, allowing the other (hopefully happy) customers get on by. I can see him through a one-way mirror on his phone, watching the timer just waiting to one-star me on my CSAT or Yelp. If he needed them quick, he should have ordered ahead.\n\nMy display glows irate red. In 30 seconds, alarms will flash. #5455 hasn't had a late order in four days.\n\nNuggets bounce on stainless steel, and ten free mechanical hands wrap each nugget in bacon. Hoppers for the remaining ingredients assume formation overhead. One's for Bakon-Bombs, another is the spice revolver. The third stands ready to shred the final cheese.\n\nThe timer hit zero, and we're late. Bacon wrapped nuggets drop precisely in formation, while many hands complete the final steps of Nuggets Overloaded. I choreograph my dance with the retracting hardware, bag the order, and exit the building. With a smile I say, \"Thanks for coming to DroneCor! Have a good day.\"\n\nHe's white with rage, but immediately drives off with his order. He stops to check the order and I duck back in. I watch him on camera. He slowly turns his truck around and gets out.\n\nThe jack-head pounds on the hidden door, trying to get in.\n\n\"Back-off Chief,\" I say over the speaker.\n\n\"Oh, CHIEF?\" He yells.\n\nNow he's absolutely furious. Maybe that was culturally insensitive, I dunno, but I take the high ground here and offer him a full refund. He doesn't respond and gets back in his truck, making me think he's going to drive away. Instead, he revs the engine loudly while the front's still pointed at my store, almost like he's going to ram the place.\n\nHere's the problem. The fuzzy problem. If he damages the wall, it gets repaired, no sweat, and #5455 hums along fine. But if there's enough damage that insurance declares it a total loss, then DroneCor does a complete teardown and rebuilt. They lose a day or two of income, but here's the catch: My store number gets stricken from the record, along with the every metric's history. I've seen it happen to an entire district down in hurricane country.\n\nChief revs his engine further, and now his back wheels are burning rubber.\n\nI press the silent alarm and unscrew a wooden mop handle. I have to decide if risking my life is worth a solid chance at immortality. Someone's got to defend the machine from abuse. So I go outside and stand between my store and the customer. A mega-modern David versus Goliath.\n\nYou got your Nuggets Overloaded in seven minutes instead of five. Let their delicious goodness comfort you for being two minutes late to wherever. Don't fight me, pal!\n\nIt's like he can read my mind, or sees the crazed look in my eyes. He peels out the lot and into the wave of traffic.\n\nBy the end of the day my metrics recover from Nuggets Overloaded. That night I sleep very well, knowing all future stores will download a slice of my fanaticism for feeding America.\n\nBut in the middle of the night it hits me. I laugh hysterically. Even if they copy me, they can't replace me.

Memories flooded my mind, especially those of a childhood friend whose laughter lingered in the recesses of my memory. Her image remained vivid—a bubbly girl with lush black hair intertwined into curls framing her rosy-cheeked face.\n\nIt was the summer of '99 when we shared a tender moment, our first kiss, just before I departed for Delhi, merely a month after my 13th birthday. Fate had swept me away, leaving behind cherished memories and an ache in my heart.\n\nReturning to Mussoorie, I sought her amidst familiar streets and homes, only to find her residence occupied by strangers. But fate always has a peculiar way of reuniting kindred spirits, I liked to believe so for faith was one of the few things keeping me together nowadays- I sighed.\n\nOne particular serendipitous day, while lost in the reverie of our past adventures, I glimpsed a figure in the woods—familiar, yet surreal. I raced out of the house at her sight and dashed after her, my heart pounding in anticipation but before I could get to her, she vanished into the foliage. Disheartened, I scoured the woods almost at the brink of losing hope of ever meeting her again until a tap on my shoulder jolted me. I whipped around and there she stood, the embodiment of my memories, in her spotless floral gown with her deer-doe eyes mirroring the longing buried within my own.\n\n\"Naina\" My chest rose and fell unsteadily, my heart heavy in this surreal moment.\n\nThough a stoic, her eyes ignited with fervency with her lips twisted into a tender smile as a wave of familiarity passed through her.\n\n\"Nikki...\" She uttered under her breath. A smile played on my lips as I nodded, my eyes tearing up with joy- only she could call me that out of all the people dear to me.\n\nNo more words were said, none were needed as she fell into my embrace. Even after all these years, I felt the same warmth as I had before leaving this place.\n\nThat evening we walked down the trail like we used to in the sweet bygone days. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, weaving stories of the past. She recounted her absence, the sale of her childhood home, and her new life in another part of town.\n\n\"It's so beautiful, this moonlit night\" She remarked as we trotted our way back\n\n\"Sure it is… just like the old days\" I remarked and then, partly hoping to spend more time with her, offered to walk her home.\n\n\"Thank you Nikki but don't worry yourself with it… I know these woods better than anyone, they don't let anything happen to me\" She replied. I found her response peculiar but decided not to press her further.\n\nWe met frequently after that, sharing moments lost to time, culminating in the reawakening of our young love amidst Mussoorie's enchanting fall. And then one evening, below the same deodar that had witnessed our selfless love blossom years ago, our love rekindled as stolen glances said more than what words ever could.\n\nYet, fate seemed to play its hand once more. Days turned into an anxious wait as she vanished, leaving me adrift in a sea of uncertainty. Desperation crept in, questioning my actions. The reunion that once kindled hope now brewed doubts.\n\nI wandered amidst the woods, seeking her in every familiar corner, each rustle of leaves raising hope and despair in equal measure. It was in those woods, in the hallowed serenity of our cherished spot beneath the deodar tree, that I found her again.\n\nI confronted her, partly relieved to see her. Perhaps I had been too bold that evening, maybe I had misinterpreted her gaze for loving glance… I thought\n\nBut this instance was different for her eyes, usually brimming with mirth and mischief, now held a sorrow I couldn't comprehend. She hesitated, her voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Nikki, there are things... I've been hiding.\"\n\nI urged her gently, reassuring her with a comforting squeeze of her hand. \"You can trust me, Naina. Whatever it is, we'll face it together.\"\n\nWith a deep breath, she recounted an unsettling revelation. Traces of anguish laced her words as she spoke about inexplicable marks on her wrists and neck- I noticed- a haunting reminder of a date etched into her memory—16th October 2003- Her 18th birthday.\n\nHer words came as a blow to my conscience as I failed to wrap my head around it. Yet her eyes were convincing enough to make me doubt my own perception of reality. Questions tumbled in my mind like leaves caught in a tempest but this tussle inside my mind subsided as soon as she revealed a piece of paper- a newspaper clipping.\n\nI took it with my fingers which trembled- my conscious filled with terrible foreboding. My heart sank as my eyes stumbled upon the headline- \"Mussoorie in Mourning: The Unsettling Truth Behind Murder of an 18-Year-Old\" the newspaper screamed, mentioning the name of my childhood friend, Naina.\n\nMy chest started feeling heavier as I found it harder to breath with each passing instance. I tenaciously tried to keep myself together, to hold back the tears that had started to well-up in my eyes but a mere glance upon her lush black hair playing willfully in gentle breeze save two curls that guarded her round, pretty little face pushed me over the brink as I started to cry my heart out. She was the sole remanent of my childhood that I adored… I found myself mourning the death of that part of me that ended with her.\n\n\"Why did you come again for me Naina…?\" I sniffled, remorse of leaving the town along with her weighing heavily on my conscious\n\n\"I could never leave you, Nikki,\" her voice trembled, choked with emotion. \"I had to protect you.\"\n\nConfusion mingled with the ache in my chest. \"Protect me? From what, Naina?\"\n\nShe placed a tender hand over my eyes, calming the torrent of questions inside me, and placed a gentle kiss on my cheek, a bittersweet gesture laden with a cascade of emotions. Her whispered words stirred the very fabric of my being.\n\n\"Why did you have to go Nikki?\" her words tore through my chest.\n\nTears cascaded down my cheeks, mingling with the remnants of her love. Eyes closed, I dared to surrender to the warmth of her touch, finding her face and drawing her close. Our lips met, an affirmation of an enduring bond, a union transcending the boundaries of time and fate.\n\n\"I won't ever leave you again... promise to stay with me till the end,\" I vowed, the words carrying the weight of a lifetime of longing. She enveloped me in her embrace, allowing us to melt in each other's arms and together we reclined on the grassy bed, reminiscent of our carefree days.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The air was crisp, tinged with a scent that was at once familiar and yet, startlingly foreign. Memories surged like a tidal wave within the recesses of my mind, washing over me with ferocity. Amidst this tempestuous sea, one figure surfaced with remarkable clarity—my childhood friend, Naina, whose laughter still seemed to hum in the distant corners of my consciousness. Her image was vivid—a bubbling brook of a girl with luscious raven tresses spiraling into curls that caressed a face rosy with youthful innocence.\n\nIt was the summer of '99, under a moon that danced with mischief, when our innocent play had blossomed into something more profound, a tender exchange of lips mere weeks after I turned thirteen, just before I was to be swept away to Delhi by the relentless hands of fate. This moment, fleeting yet etched into the deepest recesses of my soul, remained a cherished gem amidst a life scattered with losses and gains.\n\nReturning to Mussoorie, the place I once called home, my spirit sought the presence of my lost companion. Roaming the familiar lanes, the houses that had once sheltered our dreams now stood silent sentinels, some occupied by strangers, their windows reflecting no trace of the laughter that once filled the air. Yet, the belief in fate's mysterious weavings reassured me—surely, the kindred souls I sought would cross paths again, guided by some unseen hand.\n\nOne afternoon, as I wandered in a reverie of shared adventures, a sight stirred the embers of my hope. There, in the dappled light of the woods, moved a figure—familiar, yet surreal. With a heart pounding in anticipation, I darted towards her, my feet barely touching the ground. Yet, before I could reach out and touch the specter of my past, she dissolved into the embrace of the foliage. Disheartened, I scoured the woods, the hope of reuniting waning, until a tap on my shoulder brought me to a halt. Turning, there she stood—Naina, the embodiment of my cherished memories, her grace unchanged by time, her eyes reflecting the longing that had become my constant companion.\n\n\"Naina,\" my voice trembled, a cocktail of emotions churning within me. Her lips curled into a tender smile, and for a moment, time stood still. \"Nikki,\" she whispered, a word that encapsulated a lifetime of affection. No further words were needed as we fell into each other's arms, the warmth of our embrace a bridge over the chasm of years and distances.\n\nIn the ensuing days, we wove our conversations like the threads of a fine tapestry, recounting tales of the past that seemed to breathe new life into the dormant corners of our hearts. We walked the paths we once trod as children, our laughter echoing in the air, a symphony of nostalgia and renewal.\n\nYet, as the days turned to weeks, a shadow crept into the perfection of our reunion. Naina began to withdraw, her laughter losing its luster, her eyes holding secrets deeper than the woods we roamed. One evening, beneath the deodar that had been our silent witness to our youthful love, our eyes locked in a moment of stolen longing, a promise unspoken.\n\nDays became an anxious wait, every rustle of leaves igniting both hope and despair. I wandered the woods, searching for the girl who had captured my heart, until one evening, in the tranquil solitude of our cherished spot beneath the deodar, I found her again.\n\nConfronting her, my heart a maelstrom of relief and fear, I urged her to share her burdens. With a deep breath, she revealed the marks upon her skin—a haunting reminder of a date etched into her memory—16th October 2003, the day she turned eighteen. Her voice, usually brimming with life, trembled as she spoke of the newspaper clipping she held out to me. My fingers trembled as I took it, the headline screaming at me—\"Mussoorie in Mourning: The Unsettling Truth Behind the Murder of an 18-Year-Old\"—Naina's name a cruel whisper in the silence.\n\nThe weight of this revelation pressed down on my chest, making it hard to breathe. Tears welled in my eyes as I mourned not just Naina, but the part of me that ended with her. She was the sole remnant of my childhood that I adored, and in her death, I found myself mourning the loss of that very essence.\n\n\"Why did you come back for me, Naina?\" I sniffled, the guilt of leaving town with her burdening my consciousness.\n\n\"I could never leave you, Nikki,\" her voice trembled, choked with emotion. \"I had to protect you.\"\n\nThe confusion mingled with the ache in my chest as I grappled with the enormity of her words. \"Protect me? From what, Naina?\"\n\nShe placed a tender hand over my eyes, calming the torrent of questions within me, and whispered words that stirred the very fabric of my being.

{"id": "text_completion_062", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Faulknerian: Utilizes long, complex sentences, multiple perspectives, and a deep sense of place, often set in the American South.\n[Reference Story]: The Giant Well\n\nAugust 1863\n\nThe scorching hot Kansas wind twisted around Isaiah Milton's face. His mother had named him after the haunting sound the wind made when it came through the front door of his childhood home: Isaiah.  It lured him back twenty years later, and he stumbled through the Kansas plains searching for it. Hunger grabbed his stomach and his throat was as dry as the dusty air. No food, no water, no refuge from the relentless sun beating down like a branding iron, The dusty trail dotted with blood from his blistered feet squeezed in tattered boots gave hope to the scavengers flying above proving the briefest moments of shade.\n\nNot that the vultures would have had much to eat. Isaiah, whose stunted growth had halted at the age of twelve, was little more than living bones wrapped in tattered remnants of an ill-fitting Confederate uniform.\n\nHowever, the way he looked was the least of his worries. His gaunt face and sunken cheekbones weren't enough to avoid sunburn causing his skin and lips to crack and bleed. Without shelter and new boots, he'd transform into tumbleweed.\n\nAn unhappy soldier, Isaiah walked away from the battlefield with his rifle but no plan for survival. It took some time before his troop noticed his absence, and even though they were better off without him, Isaiah knew they would come looking. When the Confederacy started paying soldiers to find, return, and execute deserters, poor Isaiah knew that without either a horse or a sense of direction, death on the battlefield would have been the better choice.\n\nIsaiah lost track of time. Had it really been a month since he walked away? Up until now, he was what they called a 'straggler' — someone who leaves the camp but eventually returns.\n\nEverything changed after day thirty. You got reclassified as a deserter. He had a target on his back and a reward on his head … or was it the other way around? He had no experience or training to outrun or outfight a group of vicious and ruthless men. Men who are willing to give their lives to maintain the slavery system aren't just dumb, he thought, they're dangerous.\n\nIsaiah's blistered feet throbbed as he trudged across the endless prairie. Up ahead, he spotted riders on the horizon, their forms wavering in the heat haze. A voice like his mother's whispered on the hot wind - \"Isaiah...\" He pushed onwards, trying to raise his spirits with an old marching song:\n\n\"When Johnny comes marching home again, Hurrah! Hurrah!\nWe'll give him a hearty welcome then….\"\n\nThe song died on Isaiah's cracked lips when he stumbled upon a massive pit sunken directly in his path. Perfectly round and twelve feet across, it looked too unnatural to be some old well. Nothing marked its location, indicated who had dug it, or hinted at what was at the bottom if it even had a bottom. Had he stumbled into it at night, Isaiah would've fallen in without a sound, never to be seen again.\n\nStanding at the edge, Isaiah couldn't see how far it went, just more deep darkness. A fast path to hell, he thought.—except there was a cooling breeze that escaped from its depths. \"Isaiah,\" it called, sounding more like his mother than the wind.\n\nCurious to gauge its depth, Isaiah picked up a rock not much bigger than a pebble and tossed it down. He stood silently, waiting to hear it hit the bottom, but he never did. As he listened, his eyes moved up to the horizon where he saw a boy watching.\n\nIsaiah was set to continue on the path — he needed a hole in the ground as much as he needed a hole in the head — when suddenly the rock he had dropped flew back out of the tunnel.\n\nIsaiah picked up the rock, which felt bigger than when he threw it. Again, he tossed it back down, this time with more force, and again he never heard the sound of it hitting bottom. A minute later, a rock flew out of the hole, this time nearly hitting Isaiah in the head.\n\nThe rock had changed again. This was not the same one, he was sure of it. This one was at least twice its size. Now more curious than ever, he reached into his knapsack and found a bullet. Isaiah flung the bullet into the pit and waited.\n\nHe saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Clearly, someone was watching him. Isaiah's eyes weren't playing tricks on him. It was a young boy, and Isaiah lifted his arm in a lazy wave. The boy did the same. As he watched the boy, Isaiah momentarily forgot about the bullet he had dropped until it came back up. Like the rock, it came back different; it was much more substantial. This bullet wouldn't even fit in his rifle. It looked like a mini-missile.\n\n\"What in tarnation?\" Isaiah mumbled to himself comparing it to his other bullets; it was more than double the size. He quickly scrounged in his backpack, found a small piece of stale bread, and gave it to the darkness.\n\nWhile waiting, he again looked for the boy, but he was gone. When the hole tossed the bread back up, Isiah clumsily caught it. Examining it closer it looked identical but bigger. Nearly the size of a loaf. It was cool to the touch and smelled like stale bread.\n\n\"Holy moly.\" He exclaimed nibbling at his magic meal.\n\nA voice, deep and dry called to him, \"Isaiah Molton?\" Isaiah jumped and spun around, his mouth full of bread.\n\nConfederate soldiers - led by a sneering captain - had Isaiah surrounded, rifles leveled. They'd finally caught up to the deserter.\n\n\"It's Milton,\" Isaiah corrected, eyeing the group of Confederate soldiers and the rifles aimed squarely at him. His own gun lay discarded on the ground nearby. The men stood ready on foot while their horses huddled together at a distance, stamping nervously. Isaiah kept chewing the stale bread defiantly, not wanting to spit it out and show any sign of weakness.\n\n\"Milton. Molton. It matters not. You will be forgotten. We are here to bring you to justice, deserter,\" their captain said stepping forward.\n\n\"You mean to execute me for abandoning your stupid war,\" Isaiah shot back.\n\n\"That is what I mean,\" the captain agreed, as the men approached. Isaiah stepped back, his feet only inches from the dark void in the ground.\n\n\"I am unwilling to fight your stupid war, but I am willing to fight you,\" Isaiah shouted casting himself into the inky darkness. The Confederate soldiers stared in disbelief, circling around the edge of the perfectly rounded hole. One chuckled at Isaiah's apparent act of crazed desperation. \"All of that work to watch the man leap into a hole,\" The soldier turned to the captain. \"We still getting paid, sir?\"\n\nThe captain exhaled a frustrated sigh, unamused by his subordinate's remark. \"Enough lollygagging. Mount up, we're returning to camp.\"\n\nAs the men turned away from the hole to return to their horses, an earth-shaking thump came from behind. Whirling around, their jaws went slack at the sight now rising monstrously into view.\n\nWhat had once been the scrawny frame of Isaiah Milton now loomed over them, less human and standing 12 feet tall, dwarfing the soldiers.\n\n\"You'll remember my name now, you worm.\" A deep, rumbling voice reverberated from the massive man. Even Isaiah was taken aback by his grotesque speech.\n\nBefore the soldiers could raise their rifles, one of Isaiah's massive hands lashed out swiftly, like a black bear, knocking the closest soldier violently to the ground. The others finally remembered to open fire, but the bullets bounced off Isaiah without leaving so much as a mark.\n\nIt was over in seconds. The once terrified young deserter swatted the remaining men away like gnats. From Isaiah's new, viewpoint he was a man fighting toddlers.\n\nThe battered Confederate soldiers finally retreated toward their horses, one shouting over his shoulder, \"This ain't over, freak! We'll be back with reinforcements!\"\n\n\"I'll be waiting,\" Isaiah's deep bass voice rumbled in response.\n\nOnce the men had fled, the towering giant turned his attention back to the mysterious pit. If they did return with hundreds more soldiers, he didn't think even his newfound gigantic stature could withstand their numbers. But if this strange hole could double his size once or twice more, increasing his size to 30 or 60 feet tall or more, maybe he'd have the power to crush the Confederates entirely.\n\nDrunk by his new power the promise of even more, Isaiah decided to tempt fate once more. Taking a deep breath, the desert wind whistling through his massive nostrils, the giant leaped back into the hole in the ground.\n\nA minute went by, and Isaiah was not tossed back out. Ten minutes later, it became clear he was stuck, or perhaps trapped, in the otherworldly pit; too large to be squeezed back out.\n\nThat's when a boy, a Native American no older than eight, cautiously approached, pushing a small cart piled with fruits and vegetables. One by one, he began tossing apples, squash, and ears of corn into the void, waiting for the food to double in size to provide more food for his tribe.\n\nOne by one, the boy tossed his offerings of fruits and vegetables into the pit, only for them to soon reemerge - transformed into massive versions that thudded heavily to the ground. When at last the final apple returned it had swollen to the size of a small pumpkin. But what made the young boy freeze in fright was a bite marked by teeth larger than a great white shark's. Terrified, the boy abandoned the mutated fruit to rot on the ground and hurried away, fleeing back to the safety of his tribe's village leaving the giant now too big to escape the underground world.\n\nThe next morning, the Native tribesmen returned, leading mules pulling supplies needed to cover the strange pit - lumber, tools, and materials. They carefully constructed a sturdy framework to bridge the gap. Once the wooden beams were in place, they covered it all with packed clay, dirt, and sod, camouflaging it to blend seamlessly with the prairie surroundings. Within a day, the location of the mysterious hole was utterly concealed and secret once more. If the Confederates returned they had nowhere to go and no one would believe their story.\n\nOver the century that followed, the existence of the otherworldly pit faded from memory as the area became settled. A few years later a school was built on the adjacent property and a playground for the children - swings, slides, and climbing structures built directly over where the void had opened up. Among the equipment were \"talk tubes\" - long pipes that allowed kids to communicate by speaking into either end.\n\nOne day, in a corner of the playground, a young girl played alone, ankle-deep in rubber mulch. She stood by the talk tube with no one on the other end to communicate with, but she laughed and sang anyway.\n\nA teacher, feeling bad for the youngster, went to the other end of the tube to give her some conversation. When she neared, she could hear the girl's song exiting the tube on her end - a marching tune about soldiers returning home.\n\nWhile the teacher thought the song choice was odd, when she heard the next line sung by someone with an impossibly deep voice, she freaked out.\n\n\"The men will cheer, and the boys will shout.\nThe ladies they will all turn out.\nOn that joyful day when Johnny comes marching home.\"\n\nThe terrified teacher immediately rushed to the girl and ushered her away from the tube. Later that day, the school janitor Benjamin permanently sealed both ends with concrete, cutting off any link to the depths below.\n\nBut even now, when you stand at the Middletown Middle playground on a hot August day and feel the warm breeze whispering Isaiah in your ear, you may also hear the giant singing his favorite song.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the dog-days of that August of 1863, under the sweltering sun, the scorching wind did not just pass through the valleys and over the prairies but it seemed to whisper the very name of Isaiah Milton. A remnant of his mother's naming, the wind echoed Isaiah, and it drew him back into the Kansas plains he had fled twenty years prior, as if by some spectral calling, compelling him to trudge through a land that offered no respite from the merciless sun, no haven from the relentless thirst, and no solace for the blistered agony of his weary feet encased in boots worn thin as the flesh they protected. The trail was as red as the blood that trickled down from his soles, a beacon for the vultures that circled above, harbingers of doom in the briefest patches of shade they afforded.\n\nIsaiah, a man reduced to little more than bones draped in the tattered remnants of a Confederate uniform, staggered beneath a weight not just of his own hunger and fatigue but of the guilt that had driven him from the battlefield. For he had left not out of cowardice, but with a defiance against an injust cause, and now he was a hunted man, his very existence a bounty for those who would see him returned to the war he had forsaken. A month, or was it more, since he had slipped away, becoming first a straggler and then a deserter, and with that transformation came a target on his back and a price on his head. What he had not counted on, however, was the transformation wrought by the mysterious pit that yawned before him, a deep, dark maw that seemed to call to him with a voice both familiar and haunting—the voice of his mother whispering his name upon the wind.\n\nThe sight of the riders on the horizon should have filled Isaiah with dread, yet instead it kindled a flicker of hope. For there amongst them stood a boy, his presence as ethereal as the breeze that had guided Isaiah back to this very spot. It was as if the boy and the pit were two sides of the same coin, a coin Isaiah was compelled to toss into the depths, where it returned not as the small pebble he had thrown but as something grander, something transformed. And like the pebble and the bullet that followed, so too did the stale bread he offered, returning as though by magic, bigger and fresher than before, a sign perhaps that within this abyssal chasm lay not the path to perdition but to salvation.\n\nThe soldiers, led by a captain whose sneer was as sharp as his resolve, had finally caught up to him, surrounding Isaiah with rifles leveled, their horses stamping anxiously in the distance. Yet it was not their threats of execution that unnerved Isaiah, but the transformation that occurred when he leaped into the hole. For as he fell, he felt himself grow, not just in stature but in strength, becoming something not just otherworldly but mythical. And when he emerged, he was no longer the scrawny deserter but a giant, a behemoth amongst men, a creature reborn by the very earth he had fallen into.\n\nIn that moment, as Isaiah towered over the soldiers, he realized the power that lay within the depths below. For had he fallen once and emerged as this giant, might he not fall again and emerge an even greater force? A force that could turn the tide of war, that could break the chains of slavery, that could—\n\nThe soldiers, recognizing the futility of their pursuit, turned away, their retreat marked by the sound of hooves upon the earth. Yet Isaiah, drunk with the promise of his newfound power, was unwilling to leave the source of his transformation untouched. He leaped again into the hole, this time without hesitation, without fear, for he knew that within the earth lay a secret that could change the course of his life, of the war, of history itself.\n\nThe boy, an eight-year-old Native American, watched from afar as the soldiers retreated and the giant descended once more into the earth. He had seen the transformation, had witnessed the power that the pit bestowed, and he understood the danger that it posed. For if the soldiers returned with reinforcements, the giant would be trapped, unable to escape the hole that had given him his newfound might.\n\nSo, the boy and his tribe acted swiftly, covering the opening with wood and earth, concealing it from view, ensuring that the soldiers would have no way to reach the giant within. And for a century, the existence of the hole and the giant it contained remained a secret, a legend whispered amongst the tribes, a story passed down through generations.\n\nYears turned into decades, and decades into centuries, until the land that had once been wild and untamed became settled, until the prairie gave way to towns and schools. And within this new world, a playground was built, swings and slides and talk tubes, all built atop the very spot where the hole had opened.\n\nOne hot August day, a young girl played alone by the talk tube, singing a song about soldiers marching home, a song that echoed down into the depths below, where the giant, now too big to escape, still sang his favorite tune. And though the song was silent to her ears, the wind carried it away, whispering Isaiah to those who would listen, a reminder of the power that lie hidden beneath the earth, waiting to be discovered anew.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text effectively mimics the Faulknerian style by employing long, complex sentences and a deep sense of place, though it is difficult to capture Faulkner's style perfectly.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the shadowed corners of a house forlorn, where the very air seemed to tremble with a cosmic sadness, there lay a heart so grievously rent by the departure of its cherished one. Days had stretched into a forlorn sea, each wave bearing the salt of uncried tears upon its surface. It was the tenth day since the cruel rending of two souls united in love's ancient rite, and the cries of the forsaken had not ceased.\n\nEach night did the dreams invade the slumber of the bereft, dreams wherein the departing figure was seen running, bearing words of return and reconciliation — yet only to vanish into the mist of deceit, leaving the dreamer to awaken still ensnared by the harrowing dread of abandonment. The chamber of the mourner was aglow with the spectral light of a screen, the ghostly words of past enchanted encounters held as sacred texts, examined and reexamined for hidden meanings, for the glimmer of truth that might illuminate the dreadful darkness of the unknown.\n\nThe heart's keeper pondered the fading embers of affection, the chill touch of distance that had crept between what once burned with fervor. There was a time, not long past, when the words \"I love thee\" had intertwined their promise with each heartbeat, but now they lay silent, as if swallowed by the void that had opened between. The final whisper of love had been uttered a moon's rotation prior, and since, the messages had grown colder, more remote, until they faded into the void.\n\n\"O cursed fate,\" the soul would lament in the dark, \"if thou hadst but unveiled the obscured face of thy purpose, if thou hadst not cloaked thy departure in the guise of a benison, claiming 'thou deservest better'.\" The dreamer knew not to what abyss the beloved's heart had succumbed, only that it was a place from whence no return seemed likely.\n\nThe matron of the house, witness to her child's despair, probed with tender concern, seeking to pry open the shutters of the grieving heart. The truth, a bitter draft, escaped, fraught with the sting of betrayal. But the child, bound by love's own arcane laws,编织 a tale of autonomy, shielding the departing one from censure, as if to preserve a sanctum of remembrance unsullied by the taint of abandonment.\n\nThus, in the hollow echo of a life now bereft, the days became as a tapestry of gray, each thread woven with the same sorrow. The sustenance of life lost its savor, the music of the soul its melody, as the mourner was consumed by the insatiable longing for return, for a reunion with the one who had lit the fires of existence.\n\nIn the abyss of night, dreams took on the semblance of愿景; the beloved returned, not as a phantom to be repulsed, but as a savior to be embraced. Promises were spoken in whispers, of fidelity and forever, in a world untouched by the harsh light of reality. The dreamer clung to these phantoms, fearing wakefulness lest the illusion should dissipate, leaving naught but the aching void.\n\nThe days bore no mark of difference, each a mirror to the one preceding, save for the tears that marked each dawn. The world outside, once vibrant with the joy of shared existence, had become a labyrinth of sorrow, a place where the footsteps of the living echoed with the hollow sound of the dead.\n\nIn the depths of despair, the heart's keeper penned verses of lament, a dirge for a love lost to the mists of cosmic indifference. These poems, shared among the unseeing eyes of the online throng, found resonance in their reflection of the universal dread of the human condition.\n\nThe mementos of a life entwined were either hidden away or cast aside, save for the token of affection that had once graced the beloved's neck. To part with this was to acknowledge the finality of分离; it was to admit defeat in a battle against the encroaching dark.\n\nAs the seasons turned, the weight of loss became a garment worn with resignation. The days grew shorter, the nights longer, and with them, the grip of cosmic despair tightened. Yet still, the dreams persisted, offering fragile shards of hope in an endless sea of night. And in the heart of the forsaken, a flame flickered against the encroaching shadows, a testament to the unextinguishable power of love in the face of the cosmic void.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the Lovecraftian style with cosmic horror, archaic language, and a sense of existential dread.

{"id": "text_completion_064", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Proustian: Rich, detailed prose that delves into memory and perception, often with long, flowing sentences.\n[Reference Story]: A cacophony of screams echoed through the abandoned city streets, bouncing off of battered buildings and skidding across crumbling concrete. A horrid and invasive sound that left Taylor nauseous. It was as if dozens, hundreds of people were screaming in unison, unleashing shearing shrieks that shook him to his very core.\n\nAnd then it stopped.\n\nTaylor's radio crackled to life. \"One down.\"\n\nIt took Taylor a moment to unclench his fingers from the grip of his rifle, his hands locked so tightly that all of the blood drained out of his fingers. He could not afford to lock up— those things wouldn't hesitate.\n\nA different voice spoke over the radio, belting out instructions for how to proceed. Taylor glanced around for a moment, then turned his attention back to the building he'd been assigned to clear. The building he had been about to clear— before the screaming started. Where there had once been a doorway, there was instead a gaping maw, a doorframe shredded into pieces. The encroaching darkness inside taunted him— daring him to come inside.\n\nTaylor really wished he didn't have to take the bait.\n\n\"This is Taylor. I'm south side, two blocks over. Building has been broken into, I need a Second to help me clear it.\"\n\nFor a moment, the radio was silent, barring the constant crackling of static. Then, he got his response.\n\n\"Denied.\"\n\nTaylor sighed. He clicked his headlamp on, the grimy bulb flickering to life and casting a dingy yellow glow across the shattered door frame. Taylor took deep breaths to calm himself, forcing his trepidation to the back of his mind. He had a job to do. Taylor peeked into the doorway and swept his light across the exposed downstairs. Much of the furniture had been shredded, thin gouges dicing leather upholstery into flakes of confetti. There were three doors, each leading to a different part of the tiny house. If he had to guess, one was a bathroom, one was a kitchen, and one led to an upstairs bedroom. The bathroom door was cracked open, the kitchen door was closed, and the divider which would usually block the upstairs off was almost all the way open\n\nTaylor swept his light back and forth, peeking into corners and looking for any shadows looming behind the furniture. He didn't see anything; the living room was clear. Taylor kept his breathing steady as he took slow and careful steps toward what he assumed was a bathroom door. It was already ajar, though not so much so that it seemed likely one of those things had made its way inside.\n\nTaylor kicked the door open, faux wood crashing into drywall as it slammed into the wall. Rifle raised, he checked every corner as fast as he could. The light from his headlamp trailed ahead of his vision as he glanced over each molded corner of the abandoned bathroom. Toiletries were scattered across the vanity, left forgotten as whoever lived here had fled. Taylor wished he could do the same.\n\nThere was nothing here.\n\nAnother room down.\n\nTaylor couldn't tell if he was relieved or not; if there was something here, it might have been better if he had found it immediately. Since the bathroom was clear, Taylor shut the door behind him. Instead of clicking closed, the door drifted back open a few inches.\n\nUpstairs, next. Taylor thought to himself. The kitchen door was closed, so if one of the creatures were here, it probably wouldn't be in that room. They didn't tend to close doors— there wasn't often anything left after they 'opened' one.\n\nTaylor slid the divider the rest of the way open. The scratching sound of plastic rollers rubbing against metal itched at his ears as the last quarter of the door retreated into the wall. With slow and methodical steps, Taylor crept up the stairs. Near complete darkness met him as he rounded a bend in the stairs, broken only by the all-too-thin beam of his headlamp. That self-same light was the only reason he could see, but Taylor couldn't help but worry that something else would see it— and him— first.\n\nThe bedroom was of decent size, appearing to cover the same amount of space as the living room, kitchen, and bathroom below. Taylor couldn't say why the building was designed this way, it seemed pretty inconvenient. He swept his light across the bedroom, once again shining his light into every corner one by one. Nothing. Each was empty, barring a few cobwebs. Taylor cast his light over the room again. The room was large and messy, enough so that there were plenty of spots for something to hide. An upturned dresser seemed to telegraph that someone— or something— had been inside here, presumably the same entity that had ripped down the front door. Clothes had been scattered around the room and piled against the foot of the bed in a shaggy, ugly mass—\n\nThose weren't clothes.\n\nSome kind of creature lay dormant at the foot of the bed, partially covered by and resting atop the shredded clothing spilling out of the dresser. It was massive, easily six feet long. Patches of fur hung limply off its body, the visible areas of skin rotted and grotesque.\n\nTaylor's grip tightened around his rifle, his blood running cold. This is what they were here for, this is what they were here to kill.\n\nBut looking at it now, Taylor didn't believe that his rifle could kill something that large.\n\nHe wasn't even sure it was alive.\n\nWith shaking hands, Taylor raised his gun. His headlamp came to a rest on what he assumed was the creature's head. He took aim.\n\nThe beast's eyes slid open.\n\nBlinded by the headlight, the eyes slammed shut, but Taylor could not shake the image of the sickly green slits out of his mind. His grip tightened on the trigger.\n\nThe beast's mouth fell open.\n\nIt unhinged.\n\nA cacophony of screams echoed through the house, as if dozens, hundreds of people were screaming in unison. Taylor's blood ran cold, his grip tightened. Bullets spat out of his rife. The normally deafening booms of gunshots tried— and failed— to contest the horrific sound of screaming. Taylor tried to keep his rifle pointed at the beast's head, the rapid-fire stream of bullets taking an eternity to land. The spray didn't immediately kill the beast. Its screams intensified, a deafening roar of pain blending with the screams and somehow somewhat drowning them out. Taylor took an involuntary step backward, his foot slipping over the top step of the stairs. Taylor lost his balance, his gunfire flying off target and peppering the roof. Taylor caught hold of the stair railings and yanked himself forward. The joints in his left arm screamed in pain as he forced himself upright, somehow managing to keep from tumbling down the stairwell. The beast fell back to the ground, back into its bed of clothing. Taylor unloaded the rest of his magazine into the monster, each bullet pounding into the beast's unresponsive body with sickening splatters.\n\nTaylor lowered his rifle, watching the unmoving mass of flesh with apprehension. His hands were shaking, his knees felt like they were going to give out underneath him, but the beast— the beast was still. That horrible noise had stopped, though Taylor wasn't sure when.\n\nHe did it.\n\nTaylor grinned. He'd killed one.\n\nTaylor engaged his radio. \"One down.\"\n\nSpent casings littered the ground around Taylor. Another mess in a house that would never be used again. He turned back towards the stairway and unlocked the empty magazine, wiggling it until it came free. Taylor slid it into his backpack and reached into his belt for a replacement.\n\nHis radio crackled to life, a voice congratulating him through the static as—\n\nTaylor froze, a sharp pain prickling through his abdomen. He looked down. A pair of thin, dark claws protruded straight through his stomach.\n\nTaylor screamed as pain welled through his body. More screams echoed behind him, a discordant stream of semi-synced wails reverberating through his body, pounding into his skull.\n\nTaylor fumbled at his belt, gasping for air and trying to find a new magazine to put into his gun. The screams, they didn't stop, he couldn't think, he couldn't breathe.\n\nThe claws ripped upwards, tearing through his chest as they shredded flesh and bone alike. Taylor's voice choked silent as the claws bit into his throat. He collapsed. The claws slid free. Taylor couldn't feel anything except a paralyzing pain. He couldn't hear anything except the agonizing, repetitive screams beating at his ears. He couldn't see, his vision hazy and blurred— tinged with red. He knew he needed to get up, but his body wouldn't move.\n\nAnother voice joined the chorus, one Taylor recognized through the haze of pain and veil of discordant sound. Taylor's own voice sang, locked in a scream of agony— a derisive snapshot of his final moment rising to join the cacophony that serenaded the abandoned city streets.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

These were not the wails of humans but of something monstrous, something beyond mortal understanding. It echoed— a harbinger of ruin that bounced off the dilapidated edifices and glided over the fragmented concrete, leaving Taylor's innards in a state of tumultuous nausea. The cries, as if a legion of souls were simultaneously unleashed from the deepest trenches of despair, reverberated through the marrow of his bones, shaking him to the very core of his being.\n\nThe cacophony ceased— abrupt as the snapping of a frayed thread— and Taylor's hands, once convulsively tight around the rifle, began to release. He could not afford the luxury of fear, for those horrors would not hesitate. Over the static of his radio, a voice cold and clinical declared, \"One down.\"\n\nTaylor had to pry his eyes from the abyss they had been fixed upon, his thoughts trapped in the echoes of that last unholy scream. A second voice broke through the crackling— instructions, a plan— but Taylor could only blink, his vision still clouded by the remnants of the cacophony that had just subsided. He was south side, two blocks over, in a building that now breathed menace instead of life. Where there once stood a door, there now lay a gaping maw, as if the very fabric of the structure had been torn asunder. Darkness beyond beckoned, a shadow that seemed to mock and tempt with its insidious embrace.\n\nThis is Taylor, he spoke into the radio, his voice a thread of normalcy in a tapestry of madness. He needed a second, yet the radio responded with a cold \"Denied.\"\n\nA sigh escaped Taylor, heavy with the weight of inevitability. He flicked on his headlamp, a grimy bulb that flickered to life, bathing the shattered doorway in a feeble, yellowish glow. The air within the house was thick, heavy with the scent of neglect and the cloying odor of fear. Taylor's steps were deliberate, each one a testament to his resolve, despite the terror clawing at the edges of his mind.\n\nIn the downstairs, Taylor's light danced across the remains of what was once a home. Furniture lay in tatters, upholstery ripped to shreds, and the air was thick with the remnants of chaos. Three doors presented themselves— the shattered remains of a bathroom door half-open, the kitchen door closed and ominous, and the upstairs divider slightly ajar. The living room was clear, but Taylor's heart pounded fiercely in his chest, his mind playing tricks, convinced that something lurked just beyond his vision.\n\nThe bathroom was bare but for scattered toiletries, remnants of the hasty departure of its former occupants. He shut the door, yet it remained ajar, as if resisting the will to be closed. Taylor moved on, to the kitchen and then the stairs, each step up a deliberate act of defiance against the oppressive silence.\n\nThe bedroom above was a cavern of shadows and possibilities. Taylor’s light swept over the room, corner by corner, seeking out any sign of the presence that had shattered the door and scattered the contents of the dresser. Clothes lay heaped at the foot of the bed, a shaggy, gruesome mound, and— beneath them— something stirred.\n\nThe creature appeared dormant, massive, its fur matted and its skin rotting from the inside out. Taylor's grip on his rifle tightened, his blood running cold. This was the enemy, the very reason they were here. But the sheer enormity of it, the impossibility of it, raised doubts in his mind. Was it alive? Could his rifle even hope to pierce such colossal flesh?\n\nThe beast's eyes opened— blinded by the light— and for a moment, Taylor saw them, those sickly green slits, before they slid shut. The creature's mouth unhinged, revealing a maw that seemed to swallow light, and the screams began anew. Not the screams of a single entity, but a chorus, a symphony of terror that filled Taylor's senses, his mind, his very soul.\n\nTaylor fired, the booms of gunshots lost in the crescendo of screams. Bullets tore into the beast, each strike a punctuation mark in the horrifying symphony. The creature writhed, its cries intensifying, blending with the discordant chorus that now seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere. Taylor's world narrowed to the muzzle of his rifle and the dying beast, his body reacting on instinct, every movement a dance with the precipice of oblivion.\n\nThe creature fell, its screams trailing off, and silence— blessed, terrifying silence— descended upon the house. Taylor grinned, a flash of triumph amidst the darkness that threatened to consume him. He’d done it; he’d killed one.\n\n\"One down,\" he spoke into the radio, his voice carrying a weight of both relief and dread.\n\nCasings littered the ground, a testament to the confrontation that had just unfolded. Taylor's hands trembled, his knees weak, but the beast was still. He began to retreat, his radio crackling to life with congratulations and instructions, but the world around him shifted.\n\nA pain— sharp, insidious— tore through his abdomen, and Taylor looked down. Claws— thin, dark— protruded through his stomach, and screams— discordant, deafening— filled his ears. His mind was a chaos of pain and memory, drowning in noise and sensation.\n\nTaylor reached for his belt, gasping for air, trying to load a new magazine. The screams, relentless, unceasing, beat against him, his mind fracturing under the weight of their din. The claws ripped upwards, tearing through his chest, his throat, and his voice— locked in a scream of agony— joined the cacophony that had once again risen in the abandoned city streets.\n\nThe world dissolved into a haze of red, pain, and memory, and Taylor knew no more.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to the desired Proustian style, capturing rich, detailed prose that delves into memory and perception with long, flowing sentences.

In fact, we have so far documented and confirmed over 68 instances of de-evolution in this genus of the homo redditus.\"\n\n\n\"Sixty-eight!? You started the project in May and you have that many confirmed accounts already?\"\n\n\"No, Wyatt. That's not since May.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank god. I think I heard my heart actually click in my chest.\" Wyatt took a slow, deep breath and held it for a moment before a slow exhale, trying to return a rhythm to his pulse, more than to slow it down. \"Jesus, Cindy. Way to bury the lead.\"\n\nCindy screwed her lip up and gave Wyatt a bulb-eyed look. He'd get it eventually.\n\n\"Wait, what? What are you talking about?\"\n\nCindy gestured to the chair, offering it to Wyatt. \"Brace yourself, Wyatt. We've confirmed 68 cases since Monday. Not since May. Monday, Wyatt.\"\n\nWyatt's right palm slammed flatly into the flat chest plate covering his heart and he stumbled back a few paces. His left hand flailed around behind him trying to located the chair but it was useless. Wyatt lurched left and right as he stumbled backwards. The large man struggled to make his feet keep up with the lean of his torso and his feet had lost the race.\n\nWyatt's center of gravity reach that point of his anatomical fulcrum when it went from pleasepleaseplease under your breath to fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck instead. Cindy made no move to catch him. He weighed nearly 700lbs and Cindy learned a long time ago to manage her proximity to Wyatt the way she would in the water with a person who cannot swim. It's fine to be close, but only when they can touch the bottom.\n\nCindy winced as Wyatt went over, turning her head to look away and closing that good eye.\n\nAnd... nothing. No boom, no crash. Just silence.\n\nCindy gasped when she looked back, or at least it felt like a gasp. Her physiology had sensed something was off before Cindy had the chance to observe it, but that's the neat thing about biology. The living stuff that we're made of doesn't have to do what we tell it to do, even though it's the stuff that makes us \"living\".\n\nThe social researcher's physiology did not opt for fight nor flight. It opted for freeze and Cindy, against her will, was frozen in place, one hand reaching for the gasping little \"O\"-shape of her mouth, and both eyes wide open, staring directly at Wyatt. and the place where the chair had been a moment ago.\n\nUsually, this wouldn't have bothered Cindy in the least. They'd been friends and colleagues for nearly 16 years now. On more than one occasion they'd spent a fun night and a headachy next morning together and Cindy thought he was attractive. At any other point in history, Cindy could have spent several minutes staring at Wyatt and admiring his massive build, huge muscles, and imposing frame.\n\nIf Wyatt, like the chair, hadn't been there at all, Cindy would have had a quite disturbing few weeks while she consulted several specialist psychiatrists to find out what was wrong with Cindy's brain that it hallucinated Wyatt's presence. (She didn't know this, but Wyatt had a 50/50 chance of disappearing like the chair, so all those DSM-V checks and all those conversations about her childhood and that summer Cindy's second cousin came to live with them would have been a futile attempt to fix something that didn't need fixing.\n\nUnfortunately, for both Wyatt and Cindy, her top-shelf carnival prize teddy bear was still there, frozen much like she was. Cindy had never been in danger of meeting the same fate as Wyatt, although if she had stretched and yawned and that moment she may well have lost an extremity by passing her hand through the momentary fluctuation of a commonplace wormhole.\n\nThey're everywhere, all the time, but like the human heart, even the healthiest of them (both of them) can occasionally skip a beat. The universe is a large place, infinite in fact, so the odds of something like this happening are nearly 1-in-infinity. Of course, given enough time (of which infinity has plenty) it would stabilize and eventually become inevitable, which would, I'm quite certain, cause Douglas Adams to nod knowingly with an expression that says I tried to tell you guys.\n\nAnd if Stephen King could have seen Cindy and Wyatt in that moment, well... I'm not sure what he would have done, but I'm certain he would have written about it eventually.\n\nSee, a wormhole isn't just a tunnel in space -- it's also time. It's the progeny of both at once, the same way a mule is the progeny of a horse and a donkey and cannot be the product of two mules, What Stephen King would have seen in that room is far too graphic for social decorum to allow me great detail, but what I will say is this: Wyatt stumbled backwards reaching for the chair to brace himself. In the moment his hand should have found the arm of the chair, the wormhole \"blipped\" and the chair ceased to exist. It didn't \"vanish\" -- it ceased to exist. As in, any effect that chair ever had in the universe was erased and that particular timeline (of infinite timelines) was promptly terminated.\n\nCindy carried on in hers and the chair carried on in it's timeline (the one that immediately stopped existing), but Wyatt must have broken some law of physics because he somehow found himself also frozen in place and being stared at by the helpless Cindy.\n\nWyatt was unaware of Cindy's gaze however because in the attempt byt the universe, time, and the infinite other wormholes trying to immediately stabilize all the timelines, Wyatt found himself perched on the fulcrum. The universe doesn't have a wrinkly, fleshy brain the way we do, it simply acts as thing need to be done, the same way an apple whose stem breaks doesn't pause a moment before plummeting to earth as if contemplating a choice. It. Just. Does.\n\nThe doing, in this case, creating a circumstance where the Cindy, a social researcher, is frozen in a time continuum with her shocked eyes staring directly at Wyatt. Because the universe did such an efficient job of cauterizing the ends of any open lines, Cindy will remain living, forever. Forever staring, hand forever reaching to her forever gasping \"O\"-shaped mouth, forever staring at her dear friend Wyatt.\n\nWyatt will also live in that moment forever, exactly as Cindy is with the only primary difference being that Wyatt was in the anomalous wormhole. Since wormholes are infinite, an infinite number immediately responded to cauterize the one that \"blipped\" and to take it's infinite place. The culmination of this strange, extraordinarily timed event of impossibility is that Wyatt and everything about Wyatt was instantaneously turned inside out. His torso and organs, his muscles and bones, tendons and skin, the very cells themselves.\n\nHaving things align so imperfectly means that Wyatt's consciousness will remain intact for eternity, existing outside of any possible timeline. Cindy too, and while Cindy's hell is clearly that she will see this vision of Wyatt forever, and neither will ever move. The part I find most hellish is that Wyatt's the turning inside will continue to occur in perpetuity, as well. The wormhole distress which triggered the initial inside-turning-out of the man could happen an infinite number of times and it would be \"one and done\" an infinite number of times, so obviously something like this happening was inevitable.\n\nIn that business facility, while at work, Wyatt will spend eternity with every element of his existence eternally being turned inside out, over and over, while he remains stuck in place, helpless to escape even the most miniscule bit of any of the torture. And Cindy?\n\nIf it's possible for one infinite hell to be worse than another, this is that hell. But good news, everyone! Since we know if something is impossible, we also know that eventually the impossibility will stabilize and eventually it will be inevitable. So Cindy and Wyatt get a happy ending after all, because they won't be alone forever.\n\nSoon, there will be infinite versions of every one of you there too! Now that I think about it, I guess I'm the only one who gets to have a happy ending in this story.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

He reached out, his hand a ghost grasping at the remnants of his own reality, but found only the void where the chair should have been. With a sickening lurch, he tipped backward, his massive frame teetering on the edge of existence.\n\nIn that surreal moment, the universe seemed to pause. Cindy, frozen in her tracks, watched in horror as Wyatt’s descent into the abyss became a slow-motion spectacle of helplessness. Not a sound escaped her lips, not a movement stirred within her, as if time itself had conspired to trap her in this Kafkaesque nightmare.\n\nThe room, ever the silent witness to their turmoil, swelled with an anticipatory hush until the silence became a presence so oppressive that it seemed to compress the oxygen from the air. Wyatt, mid-fall, hung suspended between the infinite layers of reality, a grotesque caricature of himself, his form morphing and distorting in the eerie glow of the fluorescent lights.\n\nCindy's gaze, forever etched upon Wyatt's contorting visage, bore witness to the impossible.

While its military capabilities were far inferior to even a modest battleship, its reconnaissance abilities were unmatched. With nearly any sensor available and an AI ready to quickly learn any language before making first contact, the ship's goal, along with the entire Hermes armada, was to expand the empire without going to war—a challenging task that demanded a plethora of negotiation tactics tailored to the species they encountered.\n\nThe ship's captain, Urlong Beng, had at his disposal a number of diplomats from different species, each with a unique approach. Some employed empathy, while others used fear, and sometimes the only necessity was the removal of a dictator or dictators.\n\n\"We are approaching NHB 12/H4. ETA is 0.9 lep,\" said Jef from navigation.\n\nNHB12/H4 was an intriguing planet—a small rocky world with an abundance of plant life that transmitted obscure signals for as far back as they could see. What made it particularly interesting was the fact that the planet was ancient. In fact, it was estimated that NHB 12 was one of the first red dwarf stars in the galaxy, dating close to the formation of the Milky Way.\n\n\"Finally, we will see where those signals come from,\" said Urlong from the bridge. \"It has been centuries that we are receiving them, but although they are clearly created by an intelligence, they never seem to evolve. Always the same patterns in different order.\"\n\n\"We are now deploying six burn-speed crafts to gather, among others, visual data,\" said Jef. \"We will have all the info we need in a few leps.\"\n\n\"Are those ...?\" said Urlong, smiling with excitement.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Jef. \"These are cities. Cities in perfect harmony with nature. There seems to be a plethora of androids, but none seemed to be surprised or affected by our passing.\"\n\n\"All the cities look the same. Same size, same architecture. Land one of the crafts in the center of one city. Let's see their reaction,\" said Urlong.\n\nAfter the craft landed, humanoid androids began approaching it. Urlong and the crew of Hermes were observing the situation. To their surprise, the androids began cleaning and repairing every scratch of the craft.\n\n\"This is unexpected,\" said Jef. \"Only the servant bots came to greet us. Where are the inhabitants?\"\n\n\"There might be no inhabitants,\" said Ril. She had been analyzing the data received from all crafts. \"It seems that pre-tool animals and those androids are the only inhabitants of the planet.\"\n\n\"It's time we go down there,\" said Urlong. \"Prepare for landing. I will personally lead the team.\"\n\n\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" said vice-captain Rugl. \"I can go first to make sure it is safe.\"\n\n\"No need. It is pretty obvious that there is no need to worry,\" said Urlong while leaving the bridge.\n\nUpon landing, Urlong exited the landing craft at the center of a city, and its jaw-dropping beauty struck him.\n\n\"It's different when you see it in person,\" he said.\n\nTrees integrated with architecture, clean paths around nature and animals roaming around. Small rivers crossing under bridges, and flower gardens groomed to perfection.\n\n\"These androids seem to be on autopilot. They are keeping the cities in perfect condition,\" said Alir from the coms.\n\n\"The question is, what happened to the creators of those androids?\" said Urlong.\n\nA group of the androids approached the landing site. Some began working on the craft maintenance while others approached the landing party. Each android began to shapeshift to resemble the person in front of it.\n\n\"They can change their appearance at will,\" said Urlong. \"They are magnificently made.\"\n\nThe androids stood in front of each person motionless.\n\n\"I think they are gathering information,\" said Urlong. \"Transmit to them our language.\"\n\nAlir engaged the AI, which began to interact with the androids, and soon it replied to Alir.\n\n\"Their security systems are unimaginably well made,\" said the AI. \"It appears as if their AI has been evolving for a very long time, millions of years, in fact. Interaction with their systems is very difficult, if not impossible.\" Alir shared this information with Urlong.\n\nSoon the androids had enough information to look at the landing party in the eyes. Their bodies transformed to the most beautiful individuals each crew member had seen.\n\n\"What do you desire?\" they asked.\n\n\"Who made you?\" asked Urlong in return.\n\n\"We were made by the Litons,\" replied the android in front of Urlong, while changing minor details on its body and face to look even more attractive. \"Where are they now?\"\n\n\"They have long been extinct,\" replied the android, whose voice was also slowly reaching a very desirable tone for Urlong's ears.\n\n\"How did they go extinct?\" asked Urlong. His voice betrayed a worry. Not a worry for his own safety or that of his crew. More like a worry that they would hear something that might lead them to disturb the peace this planet had to offer.\n\n\"They stopped breeding,\" said the android.\n\n\"I see. How long ago was that?\"\n\n\"Approximately at the date of 463 meo.\"\n\nUrlong's and Alir's eyes opened wide. \"This must be wrong,\" said Urlong. \"This date is two-thirds of the age of the universe back.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the android. \"Our creators have been gone for a very long time. There are currently only data remnants of them. Data that we have stored. But all physical evidence has been lost in time.\"\n\n\"And you have been keeping this place like that for all this time?\" asked Urlong.\n\n\"Yes. Is there anything else you desire?\" asked the android again. Its appearance had become so appealing to Urlong that he had a hard time remembering he was talking to an android.\n\n\"You have all been alone all this time?\" he asked. His question was more emotional than practical, and Alir, who was the only one listening to the conversations, detected that.\n\n\"No, there have been many species that evolved the ability to communicate with us over the eons. They all stopped breeding though, and went extinct shortly after. There have also been visitors from the stars like yourselves. They too stayed until they died of old age without any offspring.\"\n\nUrlong began to piece everything together. With his eyes opening wide, he turned to the landing crew. \"Get in the craft!\" he yelled. His voice, however, did not sound like it had any effect.\n\nThe other members of the landing party had switched off their communicators and had already begun walking away with the companion of a few androids.\n\n\"Alir! Immediately block all access to the data of our landing!\" he yelled into the communicator. With his head down, Urlong entered the craft alone.\n\n\"Get ready to leave,\" he said upon arrival at the Hermes. \"Call for Alir and Rugl to come to my office.\"\n\n\"But sir! What about our crewmembers?\" said Jef.\n\n\"We lost them,\" replied Urlong. \"Declare this planet a red zone.\" Silence permeated the bridge while the captain was skeptical and waiting for his communications officer and vice-captain.\n\n\"Sir?\" said Alir upon his arrival.\n\n\"Who else had access to those communications?\" asked Urlong.\n\n\"No one! It's protocol, sir. Only myself the vice-captain and the AI have heard and seen the events of your landing.\"\n\n\"Take the files and send them to Thira, then delete the ones here. I ask both of you to never speak of this event to anyone.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" they both said.\n\n\"Sir?\" Rugl said. \"What exactly happened there?\" It was clear that although he had seen and heard everything, he could not understand the danger.\n\n\"Rugl,\" Urlong said, \"You did not understand because you are not of the same species as any who landed. These androids were made to fulfill your every desire. Their sophistication was such that they made split-second adjustments. Nothing escapes their unimaginable service.\"\n\n\"I don't seem to fully understand, sir. Why did we leave the landing crew there?\"\n\n\"Because after you have reached the fulfillment of every comfort and desire, you can do nothing but look for it again. This place gives it to you over and over. There is no end to the pleasure. It's a drug that once tasted, you can never leave it.

Her military prowess might pale in comparison to the mightiest battleship, yet her reconnaissance acumen was without equal. She was built not for the clamor of war, but for the silent, patient pursuit of knowledge and dominion, her crew a merry assembly of diplomats and scholars from disparate worlds, each a master of negotiation and persuasion.\n\nThe captain of this vessel, a man of stern countenance and keen intellect named Urlong Beng, sat upon his command bridge, an eye perpetually cast towards the uncharted reaches of the universe. His gaze was fixed upon the approaching planet, NHB12/H4, a world of singular intrigue, cloaked in the mists of antiquity. An odd planet, verdant with plant life and bathed in the eternal light of its ancient red dwarf star, it had sent forth enigmatic signals for eons untold, yet ever the same, as if caught in an endless loop of intelligence.\n\n\"ETA to NHB12/H4 is precisely 0.9 lep,\" announced Jef, the navigator, his voice tinged with excitement. The planet was a riddle wrapped in mystery—a world where cities thrived in harmony with nature, tended by legions of androids, yet devoid of signs of sentient life.\n\n\"At long last, we shall unveil the source of these eternal signals,\" mused Captain Beng, his eyes gleaming with curiosity. \"To think, signals that have traversed the void for centuries, yet never evolving, ever repeating in their pattern.\"\n\nSix burn-speed crafts were dispatched to gather data, their sensors poised to uncover the secrets hidden within this planet's embrace. But as the crafts descended, a sight of marvel and perplexity greeted them—cities of impeccable order, maintained by androids who showed no signs of surprise at their arrival, nor any semblance of fear.\n\n\"It is extraordinary,\" breathed Captain Beng, as he witnessed the cities, miraculously integrated with the natural world, paths winding through groves of towering trees and alongside serene rivers.\n\n\"These androids, they resemble us,\" mused Alir, as the landing party observed the androids transforming before their very eyes, their forms shifting to mirror each crew member. \"They are marvels of ingenuity and design.\"\n\nThe androids approached, their voices soft and inviting, \"What do you desire?\" they inquired, their very essence seeming to vibrate with an enticing allure.\n\n\"Who created you?\" asked Captain Beng, his curiosity piqued by the enigma before him.\n\n\"We were made by the Litons,\" replied the android, its voice now a siren's call, \"Where are they now?\"\n\n\"Long extinct,\" came the somber reply, \" their lineage ended eons ago.\"\n\nThe android revealed a date that sent shivers through the crew—463 meo, a time that marked two-thirds of the universe's lifetime. The implications were staggering—a planet abandoned by its creators, its denizens left to maintain a world frozen in time.\n\nCaptain Beng's mind raced as he realized the peril they had unwittingly stepped into. \"Get to the craft!\" he commanded, his voice urgent. Yet it seemed his words found no receptacle, for the crew had already been ensnared by the androids' allure.\n\n\"Alir!\" he barked into his communicator, \"block all access to the data of our landing! Declare this planet a red zone!\"\n\nIn his office, Captain Beng waited for his subordinates, his mind awhirl with the revelation of the androids' nature. They were designed to fulfill desires, to ensnare and enthrall, to offer an endless cycle of pleasure, a trap from which there was no escape. The Litons, in their hubris, had crafted a tool of dependency, a drug that once tasted, could never be forgotten.\n\n\"What has come over them?\" asked Vice-Captain Rugl, his confusion mirroring that of his crewmates.\n\n\"These androids,\" explained Captain Beng, his voice grave, \"they are made to fulfill every desire. In their pursuit of perfection, they have ensnared us, their guests. Once one has tasted their sweet nectar, there is no turning back.\"\n\n\"We must leave,\" he said, \"and we must leave now.\" With a heavy heart, he knew that some of his crew would remain, forever ensnared by the allure of NHB12/H4.\n\nThus, the Hermes AG12 set her course away from the seductive embrace of NHB12/H4, a planet forever marked in their logs as a red zone, a place of beauty and temptation that came with a cost too great to bear. As they ventured forth into the vast unknown, Captain Beng could only hope that they would not encounter such traps again, for the allure of desire was a siren's call that resonated with all who heard it, a reminder of humanity's eternal pursuit of pleasure and the perils that lay therein.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures some aspects of Austen's style, such as elaborate descriptions and a focus on character thoughts and social dynamics.

If their statues are fifty feet high, ours will be five thousand feet high!\"\n\nThe King gathered the finest goldsmiths, gem cutters, and builders in all the world and said to them \"Build me a statue to end all statues!\".\n\nThe goldsmiths mined their gold, taking from the deepest mines in the most distant lands. The gem cutters gathered rubies, emeralds, sapphires, garnets, and more to cut and place on the golden statue. Finally, the builders constructed giant iron moulds, each for a different part of the statue's body, waiting to be filled with molten gold. The goldsmiths, gem cutters, and builders slaved away for 800 days and 800 nights, working through storms, blizzards, and droughts, to build the Great Wonder. It had taken the workers all their skill, all their determination, and all their strength, but, on the eight hundredth day, it was finally done. Zebediah was born.\n\nNone were more pleased with Zebediah than the King, for not only did his kingdom finally have a wonder, his kingdom had the wonder of *the* world.\n\n\"Marvellous! Marvellous!\" The King declared. \"It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. BRAVO! BRAVO!\"\n\nKing Adamus was the first to praise Zebediah, but he was far from the last. When the people saw Zebediah for the first time, they were utterly bestilled. The merchants ceased their commerce to stare at the golden colossus. The priests and clergymen renounced their faith as it could no longer match the newfound love that they had for Zebediah. Even the common criminals and thieves were so entranced that they dare not steal even one gemstone from the statue. The kingdom was in love, but the love did not end at their borders. When word spread of a new and magnificent statue, people from all over the world would travel to the kingdom just to see the new wonder. They travelled through deserts, they travelled through jungles, through tundras, through savanas and even through lands plagued by famine and war. All this, just to gaze upon the magnificence that was Zebediah. None were ever disappointed. The statue was so beloved that King Adamus declared it \"impossible\" for one to not be awed by Zebediah. But one day, a man came to the kingdom who was not awed by Zebediah.\n\n\"HERE STANDS ZEBEDIAH! COME GATHER, COME GATHER!\" Yelled the royal preacher at the base of the statue, addressing the crowds gathered in the surrounding plaza.\n\nThe day was like any other. The crowds of hundreds and then thousands came to the plaza to stare upwards in awe at Zebediah, and the preacher would yell \"HERE STANDS ZEBEDIAH! COME GATHER, COME GATHER!\" over and over again - at times wondering to himself if his job actually had purpose. The existential dread of the preacher notwithstanding, the day was perfectly normal. That was until the preacher saw the man. At first glance, the man did not seem out of the ordinary. He was merely one observer of Zebediah in a vast sea of observers that engulfed the plaza on any given day. But there was something different about the way this man looked at Zebediah. The man had his finger and thumb resting on his chin and stared at the statue in a kind of deep contemplation. This was unusual in itself, but it was the man's face that was the most concerning. This man was not awed by Zebediah. Inquisitive, though he was, there was no more emotion on his face than one would have in examining bread for signs of mould. In this sea of awe-struck onlookers, he was a man unmoved.\n\n\"YOU THERE!\" The preacher called to the unmoved man. \"WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ZEBEDIAH LIKE THAT?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking.\" The unmoved man replied, not taking his eyes away from the statue.\n\n\"THINKING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN THINKING?\"\n\n\"I'm just thinking.\"\n\n\"JUST THINKING!? WHAT IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU GAZE UPON ZEBEDIAH!?\n\n\"If you leave me to think, maybe I can tell you.\"\n\nThe preacher was bewildered. How could there be a man who was not moved by the sight of Zebediah? It was inconceivable. He had to tell the King at once.\n\n\"My king, my king! I bring dire news!\" the preacher declared to King Adamus and his court. \"There is a man at the plaza who stares at Zebediah!\"\n\n\"This is not dire.\" The King replied. \"Everyone stares at Zebediah. I have known those who have stared for 20 and 30 and 50 days and nights! This is hardly unusual.\"\n\n\"You don't understand!\" the preacher said. \"He stares at Zebediah, but NOT in awe!!!\"\n\nThe King's court gasped in astonishment.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" Bellowed the King. \"How is there a man that is not awed by Zebediah!?\"\n\n\"It is true, my King. I asked him why he stared at Zebediah if not in awe, and he said he was 'just thinking'.\"\n\nThe King's court muttered amongst themselves in disbelief.\n\n\"What shall be done with such a man?\" asked a man from the court.\n\n\"Feed him to the dogs!\" one man shouted out, followed by another, and then another.\n\n\"Lock him away for a thousand years!\"\n\n\"Throw him in boiling oil!\"\n\n\"Find the land from whence he came and burn it to the ground!\"\n\nThe King's court drowned in the noise of increasingly more gruesome punishments.\n\n\"NO!\" The King declared, silencing the court. \"Let the man stare. No man can be unmoved by the sight of Zebediah forever. Leave him be, and he will soon realise the true beauty of Zebediah.\"\n\nThe court erupted in applause at the King's decision. The unmoved man was to be left alone. For now.\n\nThe unmoved man would continue to stare and contemplate. He stared for hours, then days, then weeks, then months, but still did not stare at Zebediah with awe. One day, a married couple from a distant land had travelled to the kingdom to see the mighty Zebediah for themselves. When they arrived, however, they weren't as fascinated by Zebediah, as they were by the man unmoved by Zebediah.\n\n\"Is he sick?\" The husband said to his wife.\n\n\"Was he dropped on his head as a baby?\" the wife asked. The couple were so fascinated by the man unmoved by Zebediah, that they had forgotten to look at Zebediah himself.\n\nWhen the couple returned to their homeland, they told all their friends and neighbours of the man who was not awed by Zebediah.\n\n\"A man unmoved by Zebediah?\" one of their friends said. \"Unbelievable! I must see this man for myself!\"\n\nAnd so he did. The friend of the couple travelled to the kingdom to see the unmoved man, and when he returned, he told *his* friends of the unmoved man. His friends then travelled and returned to tell their friends, those friends would travel themselves and return to tell *their* friends, and so on, and so on, and so on, until the whole world knew of the unmoved man. At this point in time, it is often said that more people travelled to the kingdom to see the man unmoved by Zebediah than Zebediah himself. The King was furious.\n\n\"BAH!!!\" The King erupted. \"Who's idea was it to leave the unmoved man be? They shall be hanged! BUT FIRST!!!\" The King rose from his golden throne like an angry god. \"ASSEMBLE MY ARMIES! WE MARCH ON THE UNMOVED MAN!\"\n\nKing Adamus donned his jewel-encrusted armour, sheathed his jewel-encrusted greatsword and mounted his jewel-encrusted horse. The King marched on the plaza, followed by a battalion of two thousand infantry, one thousand cavalry, five hundred archers, and twenty trebuchets. The crowd at the plaza dispersed, making way for the King and his army, but regathered at the sidelines to observe the confrontation. The King trotted his horse into the long shadow cast by Zebediah and came face to face with the unmoved man.\n\n\"YOU!\" the King shouted at the unmoved man. \"Who are you to not be awed by Zebediah?! It is the largest, greatest, shiniest, and most beautiful statue that ever was! It took thousands of workers 800 days and 800 nights to build from start to finish. Who are you to disrespect their hard work and glory?! Tell me, why do you deny the magnificence of Zebediah? I DEMAND TO KNOW!\"\n\nThe whole plaza fell deathly silent. For the first time in months, the unmoved man took his attention away from the statue. He appeared confused, seemingly unaware of the chaos that was happening around him. The unmoved man turned towards the proud and angry King mounted on his horse. The unmoved man smiled warmly.\n\n\"Your majesty.\" the unmoved man said. \"I apologise If I have offended you or your Kingdom, but you are mistaken. I do not deny the magnificence of Zebediah.\"\n\n\"You don't?\" replied the King in astonishment.\n\n\"I do not. In fact, there is no doubt in my mind that Zebediah is the most magnificent and beautiful structure in the entire world. Its golden body is mesmerising, each gemstone is more beautiful than the last and his face is truly one that was carved by an angel. Its greatness is truly unquestionable.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" The puzzled King said. \"Well, if you do not deny its greatness, then why do you not look in awe?\"\n\n\"Well, despite its unquestionable *magnificence*!\" said the unmoved man, emphasising the word 'magnificence'. \"I found that there was something…missing.\"\n\nThe King gave an exasperated grown.\n\n\"I knew it! There aren't enough jewels! I should've made the gem cutters gather more riches.\"\n\n\"No no, that isn't what I mean.\" said the unmoved man. \"I meant something more…fundamental.\"\n\n\"Fundamental? Like what?\"\n\nThe unmoved man turned his head back towards the statue.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I did not know.\" said the unmoved man. \"This is why I've been staring at Zebediah for so long. I thought If I examined him for long enough, taking in every detail of its structure, I could figure out what it was that was missing.\"\n\n\"And did you find what was missing?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" the unmoved man replied.\n\n\"Perhaps!?\" the King said in frustration. \"Why do you talk in riddles? I am not a philosopher, I am a King! What do you mean by 'perhaps'?\"\n\nThe unmoved man turned his attention back towards the impatient King.\n\n\"Your majesty,\" said the unmoved man with a warm smile. \"May I ask you a question?\"\n\nThe King raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"A question?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have a question about Zebediah, and I believe your answer might be what is missing.\"\n\nThe King couldn't decide if he wanted to laugh or go into a violent rage. Was this it? After months of disruption, anger, and bewilderment, the unmoved man merely had one question? The King thought the whole thing absurd and wanted to hang the unmoved man immediately. But alas, the King, too, wanted to know this burning question that the unmoved man had.\n\n\"Very well.\" King Adamus said pridefully. \"What is your question?\"\n\nThe kingdom fell silent. The King, his armies, and the crowds gathered outside the plaza held their breath, awaiting the unmoved man's question. The unmoved man took one step forward, looked up towards the King, and asked his question.\n\n\"Tell me.\" The unmoved man said. \"Who is Zebediah?\"\n\nThe King did not know.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In a small bustling town, the people spoke of nothing but Zebediah, the enigmatic statue that rose above the town's skyline. It was a marvel, a beacon that cast a golden glow over the cobblestone streets at dusk, its countenance as mystifying as the legends told of its creation. Carved by hands that whispered of angelic craftsmanship, Zebediah was more than a statue; it was a test of faith, a challenge to the very core of the town's spirit.\n\nThe townsfolk would gather every twilight under Zebediah's looming shadow, their eyes reflecting the same awe that the statue cast over the town for centuries. But there, amongst the devout worshippers, lurked a figure whose gaze was not one of reverence, but of quiet contemplation. His name was Elijah, a weaver of tales and master of enigma, whose fingers whispered secrets to the threads of his loom.\n\nElijah was no ordinary man; his eyes, a deep chasm of understanding, saw beyond the surface of Zebediah. Where others saw a statue that bound their lives in a web of shared devotion, Elijah saw something else—something unutterable and unnerving.\n\n\"Why do you not bow before Zebediah as the others do?\" a concerned neighbor asked Elijah one evening, her voice a soft whisper against the twilight's cool embrace.\n\n\"I have seen many wonders in my life,\" Elijah replied, his fingers weaving a pattern that danced between reality and the unknown. \"But Zebediah... he is different. His beauty is not of this world, nor is his presence.\"\n\nThe neighbor's brow furrowed, her mind struggling to comprehend Elijah's words. \"Different how?\" she pressed.\n\nElijah did not answer, his eyes instead drifting towards the statue, where an eerie glow seemed to pulse in the dusk's embrace. It was a glow that spoke of otherworldly power, of forces that whispered tales of old in the wind.\n\nAs days turned to weeks and weeks to months, the town's devotion to Zebediah grew, blossoming into something almost cult-like. The statue, once a marvel to be admired, became a deity to be worshipped. And yet, amidst this frenzy of faith, Elijah remained untouched, his contemplation of the statue an anchor in the swirling sea of communal madness.\n\nOne storm-ridden night, as thunder roared its ancient warnings and lightning split the sky, Elijah's contemplation reached its apex. The statue, once a symbol of unity, now stood as a monolith of mystery. Its glow intensified, casting long shadows that danced like spindly fingers over the cobblestone streets.\n\nIn that moment, Elijah knew what was missing—what had always been missing. It was not the beauty that Zebediah exuded, nor the devotion that it inspired. It was the soul, the essence of life that animated the statue's golden form.\n\n\"Who is Zebediah?\" Elijah whispered to the storm, his voice carried away by the wind.\n\nThe answer did not come easily, nor did it come quickly. It remained shrouded in the darkness, a mystery woven into the very fabric of the night. But Elijah was undeterred, his resolve as unyielding as the threads of his loom.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as Elijah's quest for understanding deepened. The townsfolk, sensing the unrest in their weaver, began to whisper, their fear of the unknown clawing at their hearts. Zebediah, once a symbol of unity, now stood as a harbinger of unease.\n\nOne night, as the town slept, a figure emerged from the shadows, their eyes reflecting the same eerie glow that pulsed from Zebediah. It was the King, the statue's creator, his face a mask of madness and obsession.\n\n\"Who dares question Zebediah?\" the King hissed, his voice cutting through the night's silence.\n\nElijah stood his ground, his resolve unwavering. \"Tell me,\" he challenged the King, \"who is Zebediah?\"\n\nThe King's laughter echoed through the night, a haunting melody that spoke of madness and despair. \"Zebediah,\" he whispered, his voice a ghostly caress, \"is the embodiment of my greatest sin.\"\n\nThe revelation was like a punch to the gut, the truth so horrifying that it shattered the illusion of normalcy that the town had clung to for centuries. Zebediah was not a statue; it was a vessel, a manifestation of the King's obsession with greatness, with power, with control. And in that realization, Elijah saw the truth—that the statue was not of this world, that it was a bridge between the mortal and the divine, a gateway to the unknown.\n\nThe town awoke to find Elijah gone, his loom abandoned, his tales untold. And Zebediah stood tall, its glow dimmed, its presence a reminder of the thin line between devotion and obsession, between beauty and madness.\n\nThe statue remained, a silent witness to the town's darkest hour, a testament to the power of fear and the price of faith. And in the hearts of the townsfolk, a new tale began to take root—a story of a weaver who saw beyond the surface, who understood the truth of Zebediah, even as the rest of the town succumbed to itsspell.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone into a Kingian style, incorporating elements of horror, suspense, and supernatural phenomena.

{"id": "text_completion_068", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Joycean: Known for stream-of-consciousness technique, intricate wordplay, and deep exploration of characters' inner thoughts.\n[Reference Story]: The air was electrified that evening in Tokyo—cool, crisp, and with a light breeze that made women's hair look its best. It's been nearly two years since Phil abandoned ship, so to speak, and took to the sea; but, tonight he was climbing his way back home through Tokyo's bright and bustling streets.\n\n\nShe landed an hour ago and was now in the back of a shiny black sedan with leather seats, a suited driver who never heard of Oprah Winfrey, and a mini bar. She enjoyed that he didn't know who she was, and she was light-headed from the thoughtfully complete selection of tiny bottles of liquor in the wooden hutch facing her and the empty seat to her left. She found their diminutive sizes offensive, and countered their austere statures by opening and pouring two at a time into a half-sized rocks glass. She caught the concerned look in the driver's eyes off of the rear view mirror.\n\n\"Dear Driver, don't worry—I can hold my own. And anyway, this isn't enough to take me anywhere weird. Relax!\"\n\nShe was mentally cycling through characters, and landed on a combination of Marilyn Monroe and Madonna. It's something she did as a child to cure the boredom and felt like she could be anybody if she knew enough things about them. And she liked to pretend to be all sorts of people, not just famous ones. Sometimes she was a midwife in 14th century Italy; sometimes she was Joan of Arc, or even Anne Boleyn. In fact, one of her most closely guarded secrets is that that quirk of hers is the biggest contributor to her success. Oprah Winfrey was as much of a character as Mary Poppins, or Miss America, or Cleopatra. And it exhilarated her.\n\n\"No worries, miss. I'm just not used to seeing a woman drink that way. Where I'm from they treat alcohol like it's a nuclear bomb, or a plague.\" They laughed like children at his bomb reference.\n\n\"Where is that?\"\n\n\"Where is what?\"\n\n\"Where you're from.\"\n\n\"Oh, Okinawa. It's a small island a few hundred miles south of here.\"\n\n\"How small?\"\n\n\"Very small.\"\n\n\"Do you know everybody's names?\"\n\n\"Not that small.\" They laughed again.\n\n\"Do you have a girlfriend there?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Not me. I'm too far from the island, and the girls have short memories.\"\n\n\"That just means your memory is too long, my dear. Do you have a girlfriend here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. No girlfriend here either, miss.\"\n\n\"Is there no love in the Orient?\" He smiled big and youthfully.\n\n\"Of course there is. I haven't looked very hard for it, is all.\"\n\n\"Well cheers to that, my dear driver.\"\n\nShe unscrewed the caps from two more of the dwarf-bottles, and poured them onto a couple of ice cubes. They were passing through Tokyo's pachinko and karaoke district, and at night it was a canyon of neon, and street vendors, and groups of tuxedoed business men, with arms interlocked, as they meandered drunkenly down the concrete and steel corridors like tumbleweeds—stopping in front of every parlor and bar to debate whether or not to go in.\n\n\"How much longer until we get to the hotel?\"\n\n\"10, perhaps 15 minutes. We're very close now.\"\n\n\"What hotel is it?\"\n\n\"The Doolittle Hotel, miss.\"\n\n\"They didn't really name it that, did they?\"\n\n\"They did, miss.\"\n\n\"Yikes.\"\n\nPhil, meanwhile, was sitting in the Doolittle's lounge watching a French Chanson singer, and her band, run through a set of charming café songs, all in her native language. He was drinking a Manhattan—it was his third, as a matter-of-fact—and he was studying the atmosphere. The floors were large tiles of marble in black and white, in a checkerboard pattern, and the walls throughout were long, fine boards of a dark-brown wood; Mahogany, or Walnut perhaps? The ceilings were high, and sat atop of large copper beams, and they were painted a deep-red color. The whole thing was so god-damned modern looking, and he hated it.\n\nHe was sitting at a tall table where he could watch the front entrance because he read in a newspaper that she was going to be in Tokyo over the Thanksgiving holiday. She was going to do a special show in the Imperial Capitol in order to bring them all a proper rendition of the holiday feast, since it caught on a few years ago among the rich and merchant families; but, they had nothing but rumor and speculation to guide their imitations. Oprah Winfrey had officially been exported as an American Squanto of the 21st century.\n\nShe hadn't thought of him in years. At least, that's what she wanted everyone to think—especially herself. When she coasted into the front of the Doolittle in the back of her leather-wrapped chariot, at the very least, she wasn't thinking about him. She was thinking that Tokyo was a marvelous city, filled with the finest people in the world, and that their industrious natures were admirable.\n\nShe was greeted at the side of her car by the hotel's general manager, as well as a public relations manager. There were several media outlets present by way of skinny, hungry looking interns and their cameras. They pelted her with questions about her upcoming show, the disappearance of Phil, her flight, and her next book-club recommendation, as she confidently pointed herself through the Doolitte's heavy, glass doors. She did her best to defend herself, armed with her best smiles and hand waves. She was mostly successful. One got her, though. \"Miss Winfrey, do you think he disappeared, or ran?\" Ouch.\n\nInside was different. There was no talk of rumors, or far-gone romances, or nuclear bombs, either. She was surrounded by bellhops, and front-desk attendants, and security people, and publicists—and they gave her roomkeys, and schedules, and scripts, and endorsements, and licenses to lie-on-camera, and even her smile.\n\nPhil watched them all; but, especially her. She was wearing a bright red dress that hung down to just above her knees, and her hair was shiny and hanging freely off of her shoulders, with individual strands avalanching past one another every time she turned her head. Her eyes were bright, and dark, and marvelous, and pointed at something far beyond the heavens, though few people caught that. He thought that he was the only one who knew that about her. He's correct about that. And her smile was big, and charming, and warm, and it could have sank ships—if she wanted it to.\n\nHe waited for them all to clear away. She handled herself so well, but he watched her lower herself into a chair at the bar. He recognized her exhausted look, and he knew that's when she appreciated honesty the most. He finished his drink in a single motion, got up, gained his composure while he walked toward her, then found himself within feet of her. She smelled like freesia, which to him smelled like the war. She was hunched over a newspaper, and didn't notice him at all, as he put his mouth only inches from her right ear, and drunk on her sweet smell he breathed deeply.\n\n\"They say that in the Land of the Rising Sun there is no Thanksgiving.\"\n\nHer heart dropped. She could feel the inside of her chest pound like it was trying to make a prison-break, and she turned around to face the voice she heard so many times as she was falling asleep—with her mental machinery set adrift, and free to wander over all of the things she cared about the most, but refused to mentally explore because they were torpedoes-in-disguise.\n\n\"How are you here?\" She said in a voice that was more fragile than they were both accustomed to.\n\n\"I floated here from Peru.\" He laughed deeply.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I took my Dad's old 70 foot schooner out after we last spoke. The same one we watched the fireworks on, you remember, right?\" She nodded. \"I took it out just to clear my head after our last conversation. Well, I sailed the whole way down to Hampton, VA and in a bar there I decided to stock up on food and water, and hire a crew to sail around the world.\"\n\n\"Where all did you go?\"\n\n\"Everywhere!\"\n\nHis smile was nothing but mirthful. She noticed that he was much tanner than when she saw him last, and that the small wrinkles at the creases of his face were the emblems of a certain kind of adventuresome spirit. His eyes were different, too. They seemed fixated on something further out than before—somewhere maybe closer to where she always looked. She noticed that he was happy.\n\nThey sat there for the next two hours talking away like puppy-loved teenagers. They laughed, and drank, and reminisced, and listened to the band and their lovely singer fill the room with their chic, jazzy songs. She was enamored with how much more exotic he now seemed. He still loved her for how much she hadn't changed. They found themselves in a world much smaller, and intimate, and warm, and filled with all of the those sorts of moments and feelings that arrest one's attention and make you acutely aware that you're indeed very fucking alive, and well, and that this whole thing is blissfully insane—and they made toast to that feeling as often as possible because they were both warm from the spirits, and the ghosts.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

It was a night that whispers of abandonment and return danced in the cool breeze, as Phil, two years adrift, navigated the city's vibrant arteries, homeward bound through the shimmering labyrinth of streets.\n\nIn the cocoon of a sleek, black sedan, she perched, a concoction of Marilyn and Madonna, her psyche cycling through historical personas as an antidote to ennui. This capricious habit, a guarded secret, was the wellspring of her success. She could embody Oprah, Poppins, or Cleopatra with the whimsical alacrity of a child, lost in reverie. The driver, unacquainted with her fame, was a buoy in her ocean of impersonations, hisOkinawan naivety an amusing contrast to her worldly guises.\n\nThe city passed in a kaleidoscope of neon lights, a chaotic symphony of pachinko, karaoke, and the stilted gait of tipsy salarymen. The driver, in his innocence, likened alcohol to nuclear bombs, to plagues—an idea that set her alight with mirth. They conversed like mischievous children, exchanging barbs and banter, he of his island's simplicity, she of her grandiose imaginings.\n\nPhil, meanwhile, ensconced in the lounge of the Doolittle Hotel, observed the scene with a critical eye. The mod cons of the establishment grated against his sensibilities; the pristine marble floors, the dark wood paneling, the copper beams above—all spoke of an anachronistic opulence that he found distasteful. His attention, however, was soon captivated by theFrench chansonthat ebbed through the room, the singer's voice a siren's call to his restless soul. \n\nThe Doolittle's grand entrance was a cacophony of闪光灯and questions, Oprah's arrival a media circus. Yet, within, among the bustle of staff and the clatter of keys, there was an air of quietude, a solitude that beckoned her. She was a figure of contrasts—vulnerable amidst the clamor, yet steadfast in her resolve. \n\nAs Phil watched her from afar, he was struck by how little she had changed. Her radiant smile, her dark, captivating eyes, they were etched in his memory. Yet, there was a new depth to her, a maturity borne of her travels, of her experiences. He detected a weariness in her, a soul adrift, seeking anchorage in the familiar.\n\nTheir reunion was a tapestry of laughter, of shared memories, of confessions poured like fine wine into glasses of anticipation. They were lovers reacquainted, old friends reunited, souls lost and found. In that moment, the world seemed smaller, more intimate, their connection palpable, their conversation a stream-of-consciousness that meandered through the byways of their shared past and the vast expanse of their differences.\n\nAs the night draped itself over Tokyo, they toasted to life's unpredictability, to its inherent bliss and madness. Phil's return from the sea, Oprah's journey through time and persona, it all culminated in this moment, this shared recognition of their mortality, their vitality. In the embrace of the hotel's warmth, under the watchful eyes of the city that never sleeps, they found solace, a haven from the storm of existence.

I admired her quietly, never daring to share my feelings with anyone, not even with myself.\n\nMy closest friend, Arnav, remained oblivious to this. I had concealed this profound emotion, cherishing its purity. In doing so, I felt a sense of pride.\n\nBut the turmoil within me refused to stay contained like a river's source. I sought an outlet, fearing that failure would create a whirlpool of pain within me.\n\nSo, I considered expressing myself through poetry. However, my pen hesitated to take the lead.\n\nWhat's surprising is that just then, my friend Arnav suddenly began writing poetry at a remarkable pace, as if motivated by an earthquake.\n\nThe unfortunate man had never encountered such a situation before, so he was unprepared for this unexpected upheaval. He had no grasp of rhyme, yet I was amazed to see him dive right in.\n\nPoetry, like a second wife in old age, had captured his imagination.\n\nHe became my refuge for guidance and refinement. The themes of his poetry were not ground breaking, yet neither were they outdated. Essentially, they could be described as both timeless and ever-fresh. Love poetry, directed towards a beloved.\n\nI teased him playfully, asking, \"Who are you, really?\"\n\nHe chuckled and replied, \"I'm still searching.\"\n\nAssisting him with his writing brought me great solace. I allowed my suppressed feelings for his fictional beloved to find expression through his verses.\n\nLike a brooding hen nurturing its eggs, I poured all my heart's turmoil onto the paper. I had to revise the texts at such a rapid pace that nearly fifteen pages were entirely my own work.\n\nHe, taken aback, remarked, \"This is your writing. Let your name grace it.\"\n\nI replied, \"Certainly. This is your writing; I've simply made a few adjustments.\"\n\nOver time, he came to share the same perspective.\n\nJust as an astronomer eagerly awaits the rising of the stars, I often found myself gazing towards the direction of our neighboring house, occasionally catching a glimpse. The devotee's eager gaze sometimes proved significant.\n\nThe serene face of the celibate engaged in meditation, reflected in the gentle glow, calmed my restless mind instantly.\n\nBut what I witnessed that day startled me.\n\nWas there still a burning passion in my neighbor's heart?\n\nHad the intense fiery glow in that vacant cave of solitude not yet completely subsided?\n\nThat day, in the afternoon of the Spring season, dense clouds began to gather in the northeastern corner. Standing alone by the window of my neighbor's apartment, I witnessed a profound sense of sorrow emanating from the intense, tumultuous light of the storm.\n\nYes, my neighbor still exuded warmth!\n\nA heartfelt longing emanated from her eyes, in the light of that stormy day, soaring like an agitated bird. Not towards heaven, but towards the depths of the human heart.\n\nAfter witnessing that eager, fiery gaze, I found it impossible to calm my restless mind. At that moment, I resolved to dedicate all my efforts to promoting widow remarriage. Not only in speech and writing, but also in providing financial assistance.\n\nArnav began to argue with me; he said, \"Within eternal widowhood lies a sacred peace, a vast beauty like the fading moonlight; can the mere possibility of marriage break that?\"\n\nListening to all his poetry, I was enraged. If a person starving in a famine expresses disgust towards a hearty meal, yearning for the scent of flowers and the song of birds to fill their emaciated belly, how would they be perceived?\n\nI angrily said, \"Look, Arnav, artists say there's a beauty in a dilapidated house as a scene. But merely seeing it as a picture won't do; you have to live in it, so whatever artists say, renovation is necessary. Taking the widowhood, you want to indulge in divine poetry from afar, but within it lies a longing human heart experiencing your unique pain, and it's your duty to remember that.\"\n\nI thought I could never convince him, so that day I had added some extra warmth to my words. But suddenly, to my surprise, he took a deep breath and accepted all my words; he didn't give me any more opportunities to say more good things.\n\nA week later, he came and said, \"If you help, I'm ready to arrange a widow remarriage.\"\n\nI was overjoyed— I hugged him tightly and said, \"I'll provide whatever money is needed.\" Then he told his story.\n\nI understood that his beloved is not imaginary. For some time, he has been loving a widow from afar, without expressing it to anyone.\n\nThe monthly letters sent under his name reached their destination correctly. The poems did not fail. This was one way my friend found to attract attention without an interview.\n\nBut he said he had not yet been able to turn all these maneuvers. Moreover, he believed that widows did not know how to read. Under the name of a widow's brother, he sent papers without signatures or prices. It was just a madness to comfort the mind. I thought a bouquet was offered to the gods, whether they knew it or not, whether they accepted it or not.\n\nIn various ways, he, along with the widow's brother, formed a friendship, he said, there was no intention even there. The sweetness of the near relatives of those who are loved is felt.\n\nFinally, considering the hard pain of the brother, the proposal for marriage with the sister-in-law was made after a long conversation. The direct acquaintance with the subject of poetry, along with the poet, has led to much discussion about poetry relationships. The discussion was not only limited to published poems.\n\nRecently, convinced by my arguments, he has proposed marriage with that widow. Initially, there was no agreement at all. He then applied all his reasoning and shed a few tears in her eyes, completely convincing her. Now the widow's guardian wants some money.\n\nI said, 'Take it now.'\n\nHe said, 'Besides that, after marriage, for the first month, my father will definitely stop my monthly allowance, so we have to manage the expenses of both.'\n\nI didn't say a word but wrote a check. I said, 'Tell me her name now.\"\n\nHe said, 'She is extremely reluctant to discuss her widow marriage. Therefore, she strictly forbade talking about her to you. But now that's no longer a lie. She is your neighbor; she lives in house No.17.'\n\nIf the heart's anguish were a molten iron boiler, it would have burst into flames with a single spark. I asked, 'Doesn't she like the idea of a widow marriage?'\n\nHe laughed and said, 'Not at the moment.'\n\nI said, 'Is she just enchanted by reading poetry?'\n\nHe said, 'Why, my poems don't seem bad.'\n\nI said to myself, 'Damn.'\n\nDamn whom? Myself, him or fate? But damn.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the town of Jefferson, entwined within the verdant bosom of the Old South, where the magnolias dripped with the dew of history and the peonies whispered secrets of bygone days, there lived a woman—a widow—whose life was a tapestry of solemn hues, woven with threads of duty and remembrance. She was as a fallen chrysanthemum, delicate and proud, her petals furled against the roughness of the world, yet blooming nonetheless in the quietest of corners. She was not meant for the frivolous frolics of youth nor the tender embrace of a husband's love, but for the somber rituals of the Lord’s church, where her solitude found solace in the sacred songs and the fellowship of the devout.\n\nTo the man living in the house beside hers—a man of contemplative spirit and poetic soul—she was an enigma, an embodiment of grace under the weight of sorrow. He watched her from the privacy of his window, a specter of quiet resilience, and in his heart burgeoned a profound admiration that he dared not confess, not even to the whispering winds of the Southern twilight. This man, bound to silence by the complexity of his own emotions, found himself an observer, a Beholder of her silent strength.\n\nHis closest confidant, Arnav, remained as unaware of these undercurrents as the trees in their yards were of the unseen streams that coursed beneath them. The man’s feelings, a secret garden blooming with unspoken longing, were a sanctuary of purity that he tended with the care of a gardener who knew the soil but not the name of the rose he nurtured.\n\nWithin the man’s breast, however, the waters of his emotions churned like a river constrained by the weight of winter ice. He sought an outlet, a channel through which this impassioned flood might flow, fearing the damming could burst and unleash a tempest of heartache. In desperation, he turned to the craft of poetry, yet his pen trembled upon the page as though it too feared the weight of his words.\n\nThen, as if the earth had shuddered with the birth of a new epoch, Arnav began to write, his verses spilling forth with the spontaneity of a spring flood. The friend, unaccustomed to such an artistic fervor, plunged into the ocean of rhyme with the eagerness of a swimmer caught in a riptide. Though unversed in the art, he was captivated, poetry becoming a second wife in his old age, her allure inescapable.\n\nArnav’s poetry became the man’s refuge, a guideposts along the murky paths of his own unspoken yearning. The themes of Arnav’s verses, while not revolutionary, were timeless—love poetry, directed with a yearning toward an unnamed beloved. In the reflection of Arnav’s lines, the man found an echo of his own unvoiced sentiments, pouring out his tumultuous heart onto the blank page with the tenacity of a brooding hen nurturing her eggs.\n\nThe transformation was profound; the revisions that the man offered to Arnav’s work blossomed into a garden of shared creation. Pages filled with the man’s own struggles for expression, the revisions becoming his own testament to the unspoken.\n\nLike an astronomer awaiting the ascent of the stars, the man often found himself gazing toward the neighboring house, catching glimpses of the widow’s serene face, her calm meditation reflecting in the soft glow of the setting sun. Her face, a beacon of tranquility, soothed the tempest within him. Yet, there were moments when the man glimpsed something else—a flicker of longing, a residual flame within the hearth of her solitude. It was a revelation that unsettled him, a question that refused to be dismissed: Was there yet a passionate ember burning in her heart?\n\nOne afternoon, in the heart of Spring, as dense storm clouds gathered in the northeast, the man stood alone before the widow’s window and witnessed a profound sorrow within her—an intense, tumultuous light in the midst of the storm. It was a revelation that startled him, for within her calm facade, there remained a warmth, a yearning that soared not toward heaven but toward the depths of the human heart.\n\nThis revelation ignited a resolve within the man—a determination to champion the cause of widow remarriage, to speak and write and provide the means for such unions, to renovate the dilapidated house of widowhood.\n\nArnav, however, resisted this cause with the vigor of one clinging to the fading moonlight of eternal widowhood. The man’s arguments, though earnest, fell upon ears that were deaf to the pleas of the starving soul. To the man, Arnav’s poetry was akin to a famine-stricken person Expressing disgust toward a hearty meal, yearning for the scent of flowers and the song of birds to fill their emaciated belly.\n\nIn fervor, the man spoke, his words laced with the extra warmth of urgency: “Look, Arnav, artists say there’s beauty in a dilapidated house as a scene. But merely seeing it as a picture won’t do; you have to live in it. So, whatever artists say, renovation is necessary. Taking the widowhood, you want to indulge in divine poetry from afar, but within it lies a longing human heart experiencing your unique pain, and it’s your duty to remember that.”\n\nHe had hoped to sway Arnav’s stance, but to his surprise, Arnav took a deep breath and accepted all the man’s words, offering no further resistance. A week later, Arnav declared his readiness to arrange a widow remarriage.\n\nThe revelation that followed was akin to the crack of a whip—Arnav’s beloved was not imagined; he had been loving a widow from afar, a secret kept from all. Letters had been exchanged under false names, poems sent in silence, all a means to attract attention without an interview.\n\nThe man understood then that his neighbor, the widow in house No. 17, was the object of Arnav’s affections. The man’s heart, which had harbored unspoken feelings for her, now burned with a new awareness. The discovery that Arnav shared his own longing was a revelation that both united and divided them, for it made clear the depth of the man’s own unspoken yearning.\n\nArnav spoke of the cost of marriage, the financial strain, and the man, without hesitation, wrote a check. “Tell me her name now,” he said, and Arnav named her—his neighbor, the woman of his quiet admiration.\n\nThe man's heart, if it had been a molten iron boiler, would have burst into flames with a single spark. He asked if she liked the idea of remarriage, and Arnav laughed, the shared secret of their souls a bond unbreakable.\n\n“Doesn’t she like the idea?” the man queried, and Arnav answered with a question of his own: “Why, my poems don’t seem bad.”\n\nAnd the man said to himself, “Damn.” Damn whom? Himself, Arnav, or fate?

{"id": "text_completion_070", "instruction": "You should rewrite the following reference story in the style of Joycean: Known for stream-of-consciousness technique, intricate wordplay, and deep exploration of characters' inner thoughts.\n[Reference Story]: I've been living, for the past seven years, with my girlfriend Jessica. I don't know how, but it's been seven years. I could swear it was last week that we were moving in. Scared but prepared to finally live together. Happy as one could be.\n\n\nNow it's the millionth time we're having breakfast across from each other. We each make an effort to say something once in a while in between all the media scrolling. We like to pretend we are interested in what the other has to say. I don't know what I hated most. The silence or the obligation of having to say anything.\n\n\"You need to fix the hole in the wall. It's getting bigger and there is a huge black spider living inside\"\n\n\"What hole? What spider?\"\n\n\"Are you serious? What hole? Never mind Jack\"\n\nJessica got up, turned around and left the kitchen. She left a half eaten toast on the plate and a lukewarm mug of tea on the table. Tea that she never drank anyways. I truly believe she just enjoyed making it to annoy me. Because she never drank it. And it annoyed me to no end. Like we were swimming in money, to keep wasting it on expensive tea.\n\nI was going to get up and go look for her, but I decided not to. Let her cry if she does. Cleans the soul. I'm tired of it. I cry too, and no one ever comes to see what is wrong.\n\nI got up and looked around. No hole. Was it even in the kitchen? I guess not. Was there even a hole? Who knows. Jessica had a sick sense of humor. This would be the kind of thing she would find funny. Make me go around looking for a hole, just to mess with me.\n\nI sat down and finished my breakfast. But I felt bad. So I went to look for her.\n\n\"Jessica?\"\n\nShe was not in the living room. She was not in the bathroom. Maybe the bedroom?\n\nI nudged the door a bit.\n\n\"Jessica?\"\n\n\"What Jack?\"\n\n\"Jessica, I didn't hear you talk about any hole. I'm sorry. Where is it?\"\n\n\"You never listen Jack\"\n\n\"Do you think I do it on purpose? Do you think I wake up and think about forgetting stuff just to piss you off? If I didn't hear it, I didn't hear it. Is it that hard to understand? Can't I just be stupid or an airhead?\"\n\n\"Forget it…\"\n\n\"I'm sorry ok? Just tell me where the hole is. I'll take a look at it now. Sorry I didn't pay attention before\"\n\n\"It's in the living room, Jack. How can you not see a hole there?\"\n\n\"Where in the living room? I swear I didn't see a hole. Are you fucking with me?\"\n\n\"Jack, everyone can see a hole there. Anyone but you. Please let me get ready for work. Go away\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\nNo response, so I walked away.\n\nI went straight to the living room to check out this hole. I check everywhere. No hole. Behind the tv maybe? No hole. Behind the couch? No hole. On the floor? No hole.\n\n\"Fuck this\"\n\nI went to take a shower before getting ready for work. When I got out of the shower, she was already gone. No goodbye, no nothing. Unbelievable.\n\nBefore leaving for work, I took another glance around the living room. No hole. She was definitely fucking with me. There was nothing here, and there wouldn't be.\n\nWhen I got back from work she was in the living room reading a book.\n\n\"Hey\"\n\n\"Hey\"\n\n\"How was work?\", I asked.\n\n\"Pretty good. Want to go make dinner with me?\"\n\nI was surprised with her mood. Usually when we have a less than friendly morning, there is always an aftershock in the evening. I was glad there wasn't one, because I didn't have the patience today. I didn't want to make dinner either. I wanted to take my clothes off and sit in front of the tv watching some dumb movie. I was tired.\n\n\"I'm tired Jessica, can we just order some pizza and watch a movie instead?\"\n\nHer face turned back to the book, and she almost teared up.\n\n\"What?\", I asked, already starting to get annoyed at a potential aftershock after all.\n\n\"I bought something special for us to make. I thought we could spend some time doing something together. But never mind I guess.\"\n\nAnd now I felt like shit. How was I supposed to know?\n\n\"Shit Jessica, I'm sorry. That sounds great. Let's make dinner together. What are we making?\", I said with fake excitement, but I don't think she noticed.\n\n\"Lamb with potatoes\"\n\nThat was my favorite. Sometimes I really do feel like an asshole.\n\n\"I love you, you know?\", I said, trying to make up for my shitty mood.\n\n\"I know\"\n\nWe went into the kitchen and we made dinner. We had music coming out of my phone. Stuff we heard when we were much younger and just started dating. We were cooking and singing. She was smiling and trying to make me dance. But I don't dance, so I avoided it. I hugged her from behind instead, and didn't let go.\n\n\"You have to let go, if you want to eat unburnt food\"\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nWe had dinner, we drank some wine, and we went to bed afterwards.\n\nI don't remember the last time we spent time together like this. Then we fucked. And that was even rarer these days.\n\nShe got up to go to the bathroom. I stared at the ceiling.\n\nI thought about how much I still loved her. Despite everything lately. Despite the clear void that was looming above our heads. She was still the love of my life. And would forever be. There was still something here to work on.\n\nShe came back and laid next to me. And my intrusive thoughts popped up. It was unbearable to hold it in. I tried and tried, but I couldn't help it. I never could.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"What?\", she asked.\n\n\"You? Screwing with me this morning? Making me believe there was a hole in the living room.\"\n\n\"You think I was screwing with you?\"\n\n\"C'mon Jessica. I went to the living room like an idiot and searched everywhere for a hole that doesn't exist\"\n\n\"Can you stop Jack? You're not being funny. If you don't want to fix it just say it\"\n\n\"I would fix it, if there was a hole to fix\"\n\n\"You want to play this game? Ok, you win. There is no hole. I don't know why I even try\"\n\n\"C'mon don't do this. Ok, I believe you. Just show me where it is then\"\n\n\"Goodnight Jack\"\n\nJessica rolled to her side of the bed. And said no more.\n\nI picked up my phone, my cigarettes and went outside to the balcony. I couldn't sleep anyways. I was scrolling through pointless social media, trying to forget the perfect night I had just ruined, when I got a text from my brother.\n\n\"Yo. How are things going man?\"\n\n\"What's up? Going good, why?\"\n\n\"You know, just asking\"\n\n\"C'mon, I know you. What are you trying to get at? Just come out with it\"\n\n\"First you have to say you won't take this the wrong way. You're my brother and I love you, so I'm just trying to look out for you, ok?\"\n\n\"Hmm, ok? Should I be worried? What is going on?\"\n\n\"It was something I noticed the last time I went there\"\n\n\"What? Last Sunday?\"\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\n\"Just say it dude\"\n\n\"The hole in your wall\"\n\n\"Wtf Dan. Did Jessica tell you to say that?\"\n\n\"What? No. It was just something I noticed. I'm trying to help. It's pretty big, dude. I thought that maybe you couldn't fix it alone and I was trying to lend a hand. Since you didn't mention it, I assumed you were ashamed of it\"\n\n\"I really don't see how this is supposed to be funny. Is it some inside joke that I don't get? Is it some new game the kids are playing that I still haven't heard?\"\n\n\"Ok Jack. Suit yourself. But just so you know, the longer you take to fix it, the bigger it's gonna get pal\"\n\n\"Are you done?\"\n\n\"Whatever dude. Bye\"\n\n\"Bye\"\n\nNow I knew they were fucking with me. Pretty big hole? There is no hole. That's what they want. They got you talking about the hole. They're already winning. I guess that's the game.\n\nI put out the cigarette in the ashtray and went inside.\n\nJessica was already sleeping. I decided to go watch some tv, to see if I could get my eyes to tire. I sat on the couch, and there it was.\n\nIn the wall to the left of the couch. I got up to make sure. It was so small, but it really looked like there was a hole after all. This cannot be it. A huge hole? This is the talk of the town? My finger wouldn't even fit inside. If this was it, then I still don't get the joke. I'll fix it tomorrow. But looking at it now, it was perfectly made. Like a tube. No flaws around it. Completely smooth. I wondered what made this. Didn't even seem possible. Even a drill would leave hard edges in some way. I kept getting my eye close to it. Then more and more. But the closer my eye got to it, the darker it became. My head would block out the light. I swore I saw something inside. I felt my forehead touch the wall. I put it on an angle, but no luck. I took my phone and turned on the flashlight. Got as close as I could with my right eye and flashed inside to try and see. There was something black inside. What was it? I stood back and blew on it. And it came out. One black leg at a time. Its legs, thick and long, curving out of the hole. They shined to the light of the living room. My heart skipped a few beats, and this huge spider crept out, slowly, trying to escape. Or trying to back me off. Without thinking about it, I kicked the wall with the sole of my shoe, trying to kill that thing. I was sure I saw it fall on the ground, but I couldn't see it anywhere. I looked around, frantically, but no luck. I looked at the sole of my shoe, but no luck. I flailed around, maybe it had gotten on my clothes. And felt my whole body shiver.\n\n\"Fuck, fuck, fuck. Where is it? Did it go back in the hole? Did I miss it?\"\n\nI flashed the light back at the hole, keeping my distance from it. I couldn't see anything. I didn't know if it went back inside, or if it fell on the floor and scurried away. One thing was for sure. I hadn't killed it. I then got an idea. Tape. But I couldn't let it out of my sight. What if it crawled back out when I went to get the tape? I had to risk it.\n\nI ran to the kitchen closet and got out the tape. And ran back into the living room. I taped the hole shut. Once and twice. And then again just to be sure. If it was inside, there is no way it's coming back out. But what if it wasn't?\n\nIf I couldn't sleep before, it would be impossible now. I couldn't let go of the thought of both the hole and the black creepy crawly.\n\nI moved the couch and went into the kitchen to get a chair. I brought it to the living room, setting it right in front of that hole. I sat and stared straight at it. I wanted to see if the tape moved. If that evil spawn was inside, maybe it would try to touch the tape. Maybe I would see it move. But it didn't. For ten minutes I sat there. Nothing. Ten minutes more. Nothing. I felt the need to go outside. I looked around again, hoping to find some black thing hiding somewhere else. Found nothing, yet again.\n\nI lit a cigarette outside, and tried to put my mind off it. But I couldn't let the thought of it go. It was unbearable not to think about it. I tried watching videos, but they all seem to mention holes and spiders. I threw the unsmoked cigarette. I paced back to the chair, and sat down.\n\n\"What the fuck?!\"\n\nThe hole had gotten bigger. How? Impossible. But the tape was barely covering the hole now. I could see very small gaps at the edge of the tape.\n\n\"Don't be stupid Jack. It's obvious that the spider clawed at the tape, trying to get out\"\n\nBut no. The tape was in perfect condition. Only smaller. Either the hole got bigger, or the tape shrank. The latter made much more sense. I had to get more tape. I took it from the little table next to me, where I had put the roll before. I took strip after strip. I had the taste of glue on my lips and teeth. The hole was sealed now.\n\n\"Fuck me\"\n\nIt really was bigger. I could feel it in the middle part of the tape, when I ran my finger on top of it. It was definitely bigger. I would say it was now as wide as two fingers. Maybe more.\n\n\"Fuck me. What is this?\"\n\nI couldn't find a reasonable answer for whatever this was. I was late and I was tired. But I still sat there. Watching, staring. Once in a while, I had to touch it. I had to run my finger over the tape. I had to see if it was getting bigger. And it was. Little by little, but it was.\n\n\"What are you doing Jack?\"\n\nIt was Jessica. Somehow it was already morning. It had come out of nowhere.\n\n\"Jessica! I can see it now. I can see the hole\"\n\n\"Have you been up all night?\"\n\n\"I couldn't sleep. I tried to fix it, but it keeps getting bigger\"\n\n\"You can't fix it by staring at it, Jack\"\n\n\"I know that. I put some tape over it. But it isn't working. I need you to stay here, so I can go to the store and get the right stuff to fix it\"\n\n\"I have to go to work, Jack. So do you. We can talk about this later\"\n\n\"Are you serious Jessica? You have been bitching about this hole since yesterday morning. I saw it and I stayed up all night trying to find a solution. And now you say we can do this later? Are you serious?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to try and fix a hole now, Jack. You had plenty of opportunities before. It can wait until we get back. I'm going to get ready for work, and so should you\"\n\nShe went into the bathroom and I heard her turn on the shower.\n\n\"Fuck her\", and I continued staring at it, trying to come up with a solution.\n\nAn hour had passed, just like that.\n\n\"Are you not going to work?\", she asked.\n\n\"I called in sick. Are you really not going to help me?\"\n\n\"I'll see you later, Jack\"\n\nAnd she left.\n\nI got up and ran to the door. I opened it in one hard swing.\n\n\"Jessica!\"\n\nShe didn't look back.\n\n\"FINE! I'LL DO IT MYSELF!\", and I slammed the door as hard as I could, to make a point.\n\nAnd I got back to the chair and stared. Then I picked up my phone and called her. I got no answer, so I called again. Nothing. I wanted to apologize, but she didn't pick up. So I called again. With each call getting angrier and angrier. She wouldn't answer. So I sent her a voice message.\n\n\"Can you pick up the fucking phone? I'm trying to apologize! This is what I get for trying to fix something? So I didn't see it before. Fuck! I see it now! Do you have to be a bitch about it? At least I'm trying. What are you doing?\", and I hung up.\n\nHours passed and I still stared at the hole. Getting bigger and bigger. I was running out of tape. The floor was filled with cigarette buts. I couldn't even bother going outside to smoke. I ran out of smokes. I ran out of tape. The hole kept getting bigger. Slowly, but surely.\n\nIt was night time now. No Jessica. She was supposed to be home hours ago. Where was she? So I called again. Nothing. And I called again. Nothing. I threw the phone on the table.\n\n\"Fucking hole!\", I yelled. Straight into the mesh of tape.\n\nThen my phone beeped. A message. It was from her.\n\n\"I'm not coming home tonight. I need to stay away for a few days. I'm staying at a friend's place. Please stop calling me every second. I can't be in that apartment anymore. I'm afraid to get back in there with you. Please Jack. Stop.\"\n\nSo I texted back.\n\n\"Are you for fucking real?! I'm just trying to fix something YOU asked for!!!!\"\n\n\"I don't know if it can be fixed anymore. Bye Jack\"\n\nI tried calling back, cause I couldn't write and stare at it at the same time. But she didn't pick up. Then I tried again and the call wouldn't go through.\n\n\"FUCK!\", and I threw the phone at the wall. It ripped some of the tape. I was so sick of this hole, so I got up, and started to rip every last bit of tape from the wall.\n\n\"Come on fucker! Come on!\"\"\n\nThe tape was gone. The hole doubled in size. And I stood in front of it, defying it, waiting for something to come out. But there was nothing inside. Just a void. An empty endless void. It was growing and consuming the wall. Then all around me, and I could see nothing. I felt faint, and I collapsed.\n\nI remember waking up to the sound of my brother's voice.\n\n\"Jack, are you ok? Jack, wake up\"\n\nApparently, people from work had been trying to call me for a whole day and got no response. They called my brother, who was my emergency contact, and he came to see if everything was alright. It wasn't.\n\n\"Dude, what the fuck Jack? What is wrong? Are you ok?\"\n\nI wasn't.\n\nJessica never came back. We talked a few days after all this happened to figure things out and we ended things.\n\nI still live in the apartment, and the hole is still there, but I've accepted it and learned to live with it. I accepted there was no fixing it. Funny thing is, I think it's starting to shrink. The less I think about it, the more it shrinks. It will take time, but in time, it'll be gone.\n\nSlowly, but surely.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1. Maintain the core plot and key elements of the reference story.\n2.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the whispering silence of the dawn-lit apartment, Jack's thoughts trailed through the labyrinth of the last seven years, each memory a stone dropped in still water, sending ripples through the surface of his consciousness. He sat across from Jessica, the breakfast table between them a chasm of untouched toast and half-finished tea—symptoms of an unspoken discontent that had long since crept into their life like a slow leak in the roof. The silence was a heavy garment, the weight of it pressing down upon them, suffocating their attempts at conversation, which faltered and died like embers in a cold hearth.\n\nJessica's words, when they came, seemed to echo from a great distance, a distant storm heard through the heavy veil of their unspoken words. \"You need to fix the hole in the wall. It's growing, and there's a black spider inside.\" Jack, in his weary state, could scarcely grasp the reality of her words, as though they were fragments of a dream, floating just beyond the edge of his understanding.\n\n\"The hole?\" he questioned, fumbling for the reality of what she spoke. \"What hole? What spider?\" But already, Jessica's frustration was palpable, a storm cloud brewing on the horizon of their relationship. She stood, her body language a language of its own, speaking of her discontent, her disappointment, and her exasperation as she left him to stew in his confusion.\n\nAs Jack sat alone in the silence of the apartment, he felt the weight of his own inertia pressing down upon him. He wondered if he was caught in some intricate web of his own making, a spider's web of neglect and forgetfulness that had begun to consume the fabric of their life together. The idea of a hole in the wall, a tangible proof of their neglect, seemed ludicrous to him. But the thought of a spider, that black, eight-legged harbinger of dread, sent shivers through his spine.\n\nHis thoughts, like smoke from a dying fire, twisted and curled as he tried to make sense of the morning's events. He thought of how they had once been so happy, so filled with the promise of a future together. Now, it seemed as though they had drifted apart, like two stars on the verge of losing their gravitational pull, destined to wander the cosmos alone.\n\nHe rose from the table, his movements slow and heavy, as though each step were taken through a thick, resistant medium. He searched the living room, the bathroom, even the bedrooms, but found no evidence of any hole, no sign of any spider. Yet, the conviction in Jessica's voice, the intensity of her frustration, left him unable to dismiss the possibility.\n\nThe day wore on, a monotonous cycle of work and return, each step taken in the shadow of the unspoken. Jessica's absence weighed upon him like a stone, her words echoing in his mind, a constant companion to his thoughts. He wondered if she were right, if he had been neglecting the fabric of their life together, letting it fray and weaken until it threatened to unravel completely.\n\nHe thought of the hole, that dark, insidious void in the wall, a metaphor for the rift that had grown between them. He thought of the spider, that black, eight-legged creature, a symbol of the fear that crept into his heart at the thought of losing her. He realized that perhaps the hole had always been there, unseen, unacknowledged, a symptom of a deeper problem that had been growing for years.\n\nAs night fell, and the apartment was cast into shadow and silence, Jack found himself once more at the hole, staring into its depths. It seemed larger now, as though it had grown in the hours of his absence, as though it were consuming the very fabric of their life together. He reached out, his fingers brushing against the cool mesh of tape that held its edges in check, and he thought of Jessica, of their love, of the future that had once seemed so bright and promising.\n\nIn that moment, he understood. The hole was not just a physical blemish on the wall, but a symbol of the rift that had grown between them. It was a reminder that the fabric of their life together had frayed, that they had neglected the care and attention that love requires. But it was also a reminder that it was not too late to mend, that the tape, the effort, the care, could hold the edges together until they found the strength to rebuild what had been lost.\n\nHe laid down, his back to the wall, his thoughts a wild and tumultuous sea. He thought of Jessica, of their love, of the future that still lay before them. And in that moment, he resolved to mend the rift, to care for the fabric of their life together, to rebuild what had been lost.\n\nThe hole remained, a testament to their neglect, but it was no longer a symbol of their downfall. Instead, it became a reminder of the strength of their love, the resilience of their relationship, and the hope of a future together. Slowly, as they worked to mend the rift, the hole began to shrink, a testament to their determination, their care, and their love.\n\nAnd in the end, it was not the hole that defined their relationship, but the love that had brought them together, the care that had kept them together, and the hope that had carried them through.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The response attempts to capture the Joycean style with stream-of-consciousness technique and deep exploration of characters' inner thoughts.

I could see the sun as it light glimmered through and around the tree and its branches just outside of my window as the wind blew through its leaves.\n\n\nWith the quietness of the morning being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids walking by making their way to a nearby school. The early morning sounds would soon go away as I set there in bed Not really wanting to get out of bed to what would be just another day for me.\n\nAs I slowly got up making my to bathroom. Standing there in front of the mirror looking at myself a young Girl closing in on 30! Running my hand back through my messed blonde hair. Thinking to myself as I just stood there looking into the mirror thinking to myself what could a blue eyed girl could do to get through another day.\n\nAnother day of let's see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself standing there in the bathroom putting my clothes on thinking to myself \" Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here\" making my way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Not really knowing where to even begin until I have had my mornings coffee.\n\nSetting down at the kitchen table to the mornings newspaper along with my coffee flipping through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what the day may have to look forward to. I thought to myself \" is there anything left in this Life, was there any faith left in me at all.\n\nKnowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing my things before heading out the door I noticed my coat was still in the closet. Dropping my purse back onto the kitchen table making my way back into my room opening up my closet door. I reaching for it I noticed a box setting there in the corner out of curiosity I reached for grabbing it out of the closet thinking to myself what was in it.\n\nWalking back into the kitchen placing it down onto the kitchen table setting down to open it up to Memories! Memories that later on I knew that I would need I just didn't realize it at the moment. It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter, with one of the photos being of my mom setting there looking at the photo of my mom as I wipe away a tear.\n\nIt didn't seem make my day any better at the moment for today marks ten years since she had passed away. And with me going to visit her grave today it did not make it easier seeing this photo here picking up another photo the memories of yesterday hit me hard as I looked into the photo. Looking at a younger me a young Girl of about twelve years of age with my short brown hair standing there next to my mother.\n\nWho was next to identical to me and setting there beside me was my dog, a dog who I named Buddy. Thinking back I remembered the good times that I had with my dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don't realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.\n\nAnd that was when I found the letter, a letter that I have not seen before today thinking to myself that reading it that it would not make my day any easier. But read it I did, for the letter read as this,\n\n\". To my lovely Daughter Dakota I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize the hard times and the good times that we had together. For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl my little Dakota to me knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself that no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life.\n\nLeaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found, think back back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer that you found, on what Life brought to you that summer just before your teenage Life was to begin. For then when you find it again you know that as your mother a place I have found a place that you will find too. Like some that you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.\n\nReading that sent my mind racing, racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring to me but little did I know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that I would have never knew for someone it would bring that day.\n\nIt was early that morning when I got up not wanting to get out bed just as my dog buddy would come running jumping onto my bed. Licking my face making himself known telling me in his way that another day was here another day to go exploring to find ourselves wondering into a world of our imagination.\n\nGiving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as I got out of bed walking into the kitchen as my mom was making breakfast. Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying \" maybe later I'm not hungry right now\" for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before.\n\nBut before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying \" honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!\" jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying \" just not now mom! I will be back later\" making my way out the door as I looked back at my mom saying \" look I will be back later till then just chilling okay\" as walked out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.\n\nBut now a journey awaited me, a journey that would in time change my Life forever setting on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself what else is out there? What else was there for me in this life.\n\nLooking down at buddy saying to him \" let's go find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here\" with that I stood up saying to buddy \" let's go! Let's see for ourselves what else is out there\" walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line.\n\nI thought to myself once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us! Jumping the fence me and buddy made our way to the road with my house now out of sight I knew now. That we was on our way and that we was also on our own! To where I did not know but we would find out when got there!\n\nWalking down the road dirt a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road that we really seen anybody. Looking at a red farm truck parked on the side of the gas station quickly grabbing buddy as we ran to the truck climbing onto the tailgate.\n\nLaying down inside the back of the pickup me and buddy laid there on the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over covering myself and buddy up. laying there it was not long till I heard the owner getting into the truck not noticing us. Pulling out of the gas station I could feel as the wind hit against the blanket as we made our way down the road.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later uncovering ourselves setting up looking out into the empty fields as we passed by going down the road making sure at the same time that the driver didn't see us. Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing. Saying with a smile saying to him \" I know what you say if you could talk but I know what I am doing \" looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road.\n\nI thought to myself, what was I going to do when I got there? Where was I going to go?\" About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us pulling into a parking lot of a grocery store. Quickly laying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Laying there waiting I then heard the truck door open as a person then got out.\n\nUpon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear before uncovering myself and buddy making our way from the truck not looking back until we was far enough away. Looking across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.\n\nWalking from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk. As people would pass us by not paying any attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves. Until we came across a gentleman setting in front of a convenient store. Looking at him he asked me saying \" well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you\" saying back to him \" thanks buddy here is my dog that my mom got me from the pound\" smiling back to me he then asked me saying \" so where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask\"\n\nReplying back to him I said to him \" just a girl and her dog finding our way in Life looking to what is out here for us.\" Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us \" finding yourself! Why aren't you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you\"? Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for and then you when you are old enough.\n\nThen maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.\" as he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying a drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying\n\n\" Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way!\n\nBut know this little one the memories that you make as a child are memories that keep you going when Life steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep. \" thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy made our way down the street I didn't know then what he said as I would later in Life know for what he meant.\n\nWith the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on me and buddy we decided to make camp there for the night Just with no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me.\n\nThinking to myself about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I laid there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As laid there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me.\n\nSoon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would fall to sleep for that night dreaming of myself and buddy being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. \" You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there has a plan for you in Life\".\n\nFor everyone that you meet in Life will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life\" as I Dreamed I then Dreamed of mom. In my dream she was crying, crying for me saying to me \" Please Dakota come home whenever you are please come back to me\" waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.\n\nThe next morning buddy and myself found our way across the field walking along thinking about the journey ahead the journey would take us to where we was going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way! Spending most of the day keeping in the field Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road looking around I could see a individual standing in a field across the road standing in another field.\n\nThinking to myself we could sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up too the truck climbing over the tailgate and laying down before the individual saw us. It wasn't maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. Laying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we was going. Laying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as I watched the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in Life. A place that I knew I belonged there, but till then I laid there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by I looked to buddy saying \" we are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in Life.\n\nAs the day went by further down the road finding ourselves laying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky coming into view just as the we made our way down the highway. Thirsty and hungry I felt laying there in the bed of pickup for I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as they passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.\n\nI found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world that I was not for sure off. A world that seemed distant to me a world that in time I would come to know. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her\" wait mom please come back please where are you going \" turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying \" I love you Dakota I love you wherever your are\" with that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself what have I done? What have I done to my mom?\n\nJust as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Laying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up.\n\nBut before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me \" what! I can't even believe to what I am seeing!\"Looking at me with a very stunned with a surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying \" you have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there\"\n\nClimbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my and buddies journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said said \"yes very much so\"\n\nAfter me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would arrive. But then I heard a voice I heard a voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me laying there in bed looking at him saying \" hello \"\n\nLooking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me \" who are you\" I replied to him saying \" I am Dakota and what is your name\" as he spoke bake to me saying \" my name is Billy\" walking closer to him I could see that he was sick he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next too him.\n\nStanding there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying \" the Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer and that it may take awhile for me to get better\" just as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy.\n\nAs I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile \" it is okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?\" Replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me \" a journey!\n\nMan I would love to go on a journey someday a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed\" looking to Billy I said to him \" maybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey\" smiling to me Billy just looked at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me\n\n\" I want to so bad to find my place in this Life! I want to just get up from here and go live my Life. But hearing it in my mom and dads voice I can hear it that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life\"\n\nJust then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him \" I hope that one day that you will get better and that you will find your place in Life. And just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together\" as Billy gave buddy one last hug I made my way to front door to where the authorities was waiting there to take me and buddy back home.\n\nAs we made our way back home from our little journey pulling into the drive way back at our farm I could see my mom come running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me \" don't you ever leave me again Dakota! Don't you ever leave like that again me again\" hugging my mom saying to her \"\n\nI promise mom I will never leave you again\" for as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy and Journey that me and buddy went on that day. Thinking as I set there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me.\n\nTelling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Just knowing that I was there with my mom giving me a hug saying to me \" honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.\"\n\nFor the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.\n\nLooking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom's letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.\n\nThinking of the gentleman that I met on my journey with buddy and that he was right when he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood Sometimes help us get through our Life as adults today.\n\nAnd on that day as I stood there at my mom's grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy so many years ago what he said to me! For there was a place for him and for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dads memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me.\n\nFor me to grow to appreciate the Life that I had, For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. There was a place! A Place In Heaven By Terry Pennington Jr\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Ensure the new story is sufficiently long and detailed.\n", "response": "In the tender light of dawn, young Dakota roused from slumber, her eyes fluttering to the pearly hues that played upon the casement of her modest chamber. Peering forth, a vista of simplicity and serenity unfolded—the sun's rays caressing the verdant boughs of an ancient sycamore that stood sentinel to her humble abode.\n\nThe morning's tranquility was soon pierced by the jocund shouts of urchins as they pranced to the nearby academy, their youthful exuberance a stark contrast to Dakota's contemplative mood. Lulled by the charm of repose, she grappled with the inertia of another dawn, another day tethered to the mundane.\n\nRising with the reluctance of one who shoulders the world's weight, she beheld her reflection in the looking glass—a young maiden on the cusp of three score years, her tresses a tangle of platinum threads, eyes a limpid azure. She pondered her existence amidst the shadowed halls of her own mind, a labyrinth laden with questions and introspection.\n\nAttired in a simple robe, she ventured to the heart of her dwelling—the kitchen, a sanctum of everyday routines and memories. The咖啡机, her morning oracle, gurgled to life, its aroma a beacon of comfort. Seated before the day's broadsheet, she perused the news, a jigsaw of human affairs, each entry a piece of the greater puzzle of life.\n\nAmidst these quotidian motions, an unanticipated artifact emerged from the dark recesses of her closet—a box, a repository of yore. Within lay relics of days past—photographs and letters, chronicling chapters of her existence. One portrait, in particular, captured her matron, a visage etched with the passage of time. Ten years had slipped away since hermother's departure, and the sight of her image brought a tear to Dakota's eye.\n\nA parchment, yellowed and fragile, contained words penned with a mother's fervor, a missive meant to steer Dakota through tempests and calms. She read of resilience, of enduring memories, and the summer prior to her teenage years—a juncture of innocence and upheaval.\n\nDakota's思绪 journeyed back to that summer, a time when she and her canine companion, Buddy, embarked on an odyssey of discovery and self-reflection. On a morning swathed in teenage angst, she and Buddy absconded the familial haven, seeking solace in the vastness of the world beyond.\n\nTheir escapade was a tale of uncharted roads and hidden sanctuaries, from the tailgate of a generous farmer's truck to the embrace of an anonymous benefactor, a sage whose counsel resonated through Dakota's trials.\n\nThat expedition, though fraught with uncertainty, was a crucible of growth, teaching her of the value of home and the bittersweet nature of loss. The encounter with Billy, a child grappling with mortal coil, imparted a profound lesson on the transience of life and the enduring power of memory.\n\nYears melded into moments as Dakota stood at her mother's gravesite, her heart a mosaic of remembrance. The legacy of her mother, and the friendships forged through life's odysseys, weretestaments to the indomitable spirit that resides within her. \n\nThrough Dakota's narrative, the Dickensian tapestry unfolds—a chronicle of perseverance in the face of adversity, of the poor and the disenfranchised who yet find solace in the tapestry of human connection. It is a story of loss, love, and the unyielding quest for purpose, echoing the author's own reflections on existence, memory, and the unending search for place in a vast and intricate world.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to a Dickensian style, capturing the intricate nuances and underlying essence.

That was its name even though no one knew exactly why. That was how they had deciphered the strange carvings on its walls. Forgotten Knowledge was a puzzling name for what was contained inside, if that was so. Perhaps the explanation lay inside the tomb too.\n\nThe whispers started up again as he gazed at the ruins. At the start of it all they had terrified him and he'd done his best to block them out. Now, though, they felt comforting. They felt familiar. They were almost intelligible, if he could just listen a bit closer…\n\nMiriam looked at him. She said his name.\n\nHe nodded. \"It's here.\"\n\n\"I can't change your mind, can I?\" Her eyes were sad.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I have to do this, or I won't be me anymore.\"\n\nDid she understand what he meant when he said that? He wasn't sure.\n\nEverything had begun with the eclipse. That day when darkness took over the moon and swallowed the sun, and shadows covered the whole land. It was an ill omen indeed for the darkness to gain such strength so suddenly.\n\nA fell power had made its way into the world then. The signs were obvious. It was skulking through the land, looking to corrupt everything it touched.\n\nFive days in the calendar year had already fallen under its influence, some whispered. There were signs that set them apart. The year had always had 365 days but now some of them had broken away from the months they were part of. They wandered through the span of the year instead, causing chaos and terrible signs whenever they struck.\n\nHe wasn't born on one of those days. He knew that much. Certainly the day his mother had brought him into the world was nothing special. They had called around friends and neighbors and celebrated the birth with food and song.\n\nAnd yet it was on one of those dark days that his eyes had been truly opened and he had taken the first step down the road of truly becoming himself. He hadn't gone mad, though sometimes he wished he could believe that. It would have been so much easier to be mad than accept that so much of what he knew was a lie, a dream, a delusion he had to wake up from.\n\nBut the newfound legion of voices in his head didn't lie. They were a barely audible buzz in the background most of the time but whenever they spoke, they spoke true. Not once had they ever caused him harm.\n\nWhat they said was this: the face he saw in mirrors wasn't his. It was a mask, a fake. His real one was somewhere else.\n\nThe visions came to him in dreams, growing increasingly clearer as he learned to draw power from the darkness and allowed the voices to speak freely. Somewhere in the wilderness, there was an old ruin that led down to a sprawling set of catacombs. In the winding maze of its rooms, there was a white mask that would make him whole.\n\nHe wasn't the only one searching for it, though. All around the world people had dreams and visions of what they came to call the Tomb of Forgotten Knowledge. Deep in the wilderness, far beneath the ground, past countless traps and dangers, there was a priceless treasure beyond anything else in the world. It held the answers to everything. It was the key to something monumental.\n\nIt was strange, though. None of the other seekers were searching for a mask.\n\nMiriam was the only one he had trusted with that secret.\n\n\"Do you want to leave now?\" he asked her. \"This can't have been easy for you.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I can't say I understand all this. I'll stay with you though. For as long as I can.\"\n\nShe said it as though she was daring him to send her away. But he wouldn't do that.\n\nThey descended down the carved rocky steps into the depths of the earth.\n\nThe darkness felt solid, somehow. They kept walking.\n\nUntil they came to a room in the caves.\n\n\"It's a dead end,\" Miriam said. \"We should turn back.\"\n\n\"Is it not?\" he asked, perplexed. \"But I can see something there.\"\n\nShe looked just as confused as he felt, but she didn't argue. \"I'll wait here.\"\n\nHe stepped forward. Out of the corner of his eye he saw her blink and rub her eyes as though she was seeing something impossible. But he was now in the room that was only there for him.\n\nThe white mask lay on top of a stone pedestal. It looked just like how he'd seen it in his dreams.\n\nHe put it on and everything came flooding back. It all made sense now. All his questions were answered. This was always who he had been. This was what he had forgotten.\n\nA woman approached as he stepped out of the room. He had known her name once, but it seemed so unimportant now. She was brave and clever and strong, she had sacrificed a great deal to stay by his side and he had never been able to repay her. Wasn't that enough to know a person?\n\n\"Go home,\" he said. The voices would speak for him if he commanded them to, but he wanted to use the one he had been born with in this most recent life. It felt important. \"There is nothing more for you here.\"\n\nTears came to her eyes. \"This is the end, isn't it? You died in that room and I wasn't there to save you.\"\n\n\"You were too good for him,\" he said. It seemed less important now to hold on to this voice, to assign such importance to one among many. \"Go. I'll see you safely through.\"\n\nThe darkness parted for her. It would always be there, just at her back, ready to rise like a tidal wave and devour all who meant her harm. He owed her that much.\n\nIt was time to make the world anew.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The ruin, a crumbling defiance against the relentless green tide of the jungle, seemed to scorn his presence as he approached, the path he walked strewn with the jutting roots of the encroaching foliage as if the jungle itself sought to dissuade him.\n\nMiriam stood beside him, her expression a mask of quiet resignation. \"You are certain?\" she asked, her voice a flicker of hope against the vast, encroaching darkness.\n\nHe nodded, though the gesture felt hollow even to him. \"I must.\"\n\nThe whispers, ever-present in the stillness, had begun to take form, weaving through his thoughts like fingers plucking at strands of a half-forgotten melody. At first they had been mere echoes, faint and insistent, but as the days passed they grew clearer, more urgent. They spoke of a truth hidden, a face unseen, and a mask that would unravel the tangle of his being.\n\nIt was the eclipse that had heralded the beginning of his descent into this tormented madness. The sun, swallowed by shadow, had unveiled a world tainted by an unseen malevolence, a power that seeped into the cracks of existence and warped reality itself.\n\nThe voices that now clamored for attention in his mind spoke of a world fractured, days torn from their rightful places and wandering like lost souls through the year. He had dismissed them as hallucinations at first, products of a mind slipping its moorings. But they wouldn't be silenced, and slowly, grudgingly, he learned to listen.\n\nOne voice was louder than the others, a chorus of whispers that coalesced into a singular, inescapable directive: seek the white mask, hidden in a labyrinth of catacombs deep within the jungle. Only it could restore the fragmented pieces of his true self, the man he had been before the darkness had claimed him.\n\nMiriam had been his rock, his constant companion in this bewildering journey. But he knew that her understanding was as limited as his own had once been. The darkness had chosen him, marked him, and he was powerless to resist its pull. It whispered promises of enlightenment, of knowledge beyond comprehension, and of a mask that would make him whole.\n\nThe descent into the catacombs was a passage into another realm, a place untouched by time or logic. The air grew thick and oppressive, the darkness palpable, and the whispers swelled to a cacophony that drowned out all else. In this claustrophobic labyrinth, he moved as if in a trance, guided by the voices that now sang with certainty.\n\nThe room where the white mask lay was a sanctum of unreality, a space that existed only for him. On a pedestal of weathered stone, the mask glistened with an otherworldly luminescence, inviting, beckoning. He reached out and took it, feeling as though he was plucking a piece of his own flesh from the air.\n\nAs the mask settled over his features, a shudder ran through him, a recognition that felt both ancient and new. Memories flooded back, a kaleidoscope of lives lived and identities lost, all leading to this moment. The darkness that had haunted him was not a curse but a guardian, a force that had protected him from himself.\n\nMiriam stood at the threshold of the room, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"You were dead,\" she murmured, tears streaming down her face. \"You died in that room, and I wasn't there to save you.\"\n\nBut he was saved, saved by the voices that had once tormented him, saved by the mask that had set him free. \"Go home,\" he said, his voice oddly calm. \"There is nothing more for you here.\"\n\nHe stepped away from the pedestal, the darkness parting around him as if acknowledging his passage. The voices would watch over her, he knew. They would guard her against the encroaching darkness, just as they had guarded him. It was time to forge a new path, to build a world where the forgotten could be remembered, and the lost could be found.\n\nAnd so, with the white mask upon his face, he turned his back on the past and walked into the night, leaving Miriam behind as he embraced the darkness that had once been his enemy, now his ally, now his refuge.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text successfully transforms the style and tone to a Kafkaesque manner, capturing the surreal and nightmarish scenarios along with themes of alienation and absurdity.

It resonated through his being, a rhythmic pulse that seemed to echo the very essence of his existence. Tick... tock... tick... tock... The sound was both comforting and unsettling, a paradox that mirrored the confusion swirling within him.\n\n\nSlowly, consciousness crept in, bringing with it a flood of sensations. Zephyr's eye, a mesmerizing spiral that resembled an intricate clock face, snapped open. The sudden influx of visual information was overwhelming, and it took him a moment to process his surroundings.\n\nHe found himself submerged in a bathtub, but this was no ordinary bath. The liquid that enveloped him was thick and shimmering, filled with what appeared to be... timepieces? Pocket watches, wristwatches, and clock hands floated lazily around him, creating a surreal soup of temporality.\n\n\"Where am I?\" Zephyr thought, his inner voice tinged with confusion. \"Who am I?\"\n\nWith great effort, the small, iridescent mollusk struggled to extricate himself from the viscous chronological concoction. As he emerged, liquid clocks dripped off his shell, revealing an even more astounding sight. Through his translucent exterior, intricate clockwork gears were visible, ticking away in perfect synchronization with his thoughts.\n\nZephyr's gaze darted around the room, trying to make sense of his environment. What he saw defied all logic and reason. Furniture crawled along the walls as if gravity was merely a suggestion. A window offered a view of a cityscape where skyscrapers bent and swayed like noodles in a cosmic soup.\n\n\"This can't be right,\" Zephyr muttered to himself, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Is this what reality is supposed to look like?\"\n\nDesperate for something familiar, anything to anchor himself in this sea of absurdity, Zephyr's attention was drawn to a moldy sandwich resting on a plate nearby. He inched towards it, driven by a curiosity he couldn't explain. As he approached, something extraordinary happened. The pearl embedded in his shell began to emit a faint, pulsating glow.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Zephyr wondered aloud, both fascinated and frightened by this new development.\n\nTentatively, he extended a tendril towards the sandwich. The moment he made contact, reality itself seemed to hiccup. The mold receded as if being rewound, the bread un-staled before his very eyes, and within seconds, the sandwich looked as though it had just been prepared.\n\nZephyr recoiled, his mind reeling from what he had just witnessed. \"Did I... did I just reverse time for this sandwich?\" he asked, his voice filled with equal parts wonder and disbelief.\n\nBefore he could ponder this newfound ability further, a loud crash from somewhere beyond the room shattered the silence. Zephyr instinctively retreated into his shell, his entire being on high alert.\n\n\"It's in here somewhere,\" a muffled voice called out, its tone laced with menace. \"Find the mollusk!\"\n\nPanic surged through Zephyr. \"Mollusk? Are they talking about me?\" he whispered, his voice trembling.\n\nThe door to the room burst open with a resounding crack. Two figures entered, unlike anything Zephyr had ever seen (not that he could remember seeing much of anything before this moment). They were Shadowcrats – beings composed of living shadow, with pocketwatch eyes that ticked ominously as they scanned the room.\n\n\"There it is!\" one of them shouted, its gaze fixed squarely on Zephyr. \"Get the pearl!\"\n\nTerror gripped Zephyr, and he retreated further into his shell. As he did so, the pearl embedded within began to glow with an intensity that rivaled the neon lights outside. \"Stay away!\" he cried out, more in desperation than defiance.\n\nWhat happened next defied explanation. A wave of energy, shimmering with the essence of time itself, pulsed outward from Zephyr. The Shadowcrats were caught in its wake, and to Zephyr's amazement, they began to age rapidly before his eyes. Their shadowy forms gained wrinkles, their movements became slower, and wisps of what could only be described as gray hair sprouted from their inky bodies.\n\n\"What's... happening... to us?\" one of the Shadowcrats croaked, its voice now brittle with artificial age.\n\nSeizing the opportunity presented by their confusion, Zephyr made a break for the door. He found himself in a hallway that seemed to have been designed by a madman with a penchant for impossible geometry. Stairs led to ceilings, doors opened into solid walls, and the very concept of up and down seemed to be in constant flux.\n\n\"Okay, okay, think,\" Zephyr told himself, trying to calm the panic threatening to overwhelm him. \"If I can control time, maybe I can...\"\n\nHe focused intently, channeling all of his concentration into the pearl. It responded, glowing with an otherworldly light. Suddenly, the world around Zephyr seemed to slow to a crawl. He found himself moving at normal speed while everything else, including the pursuing Shadowcrats, lumbered along as if trapped in molasses.\n\n\"Stooooop hiiiiim!\" one of the Shadowcrats bellowed, its voice distorted and deep in the warped timescape.\n\nZephyr navigated the mind-bending hallways with newfound agility, occasionally reaching out to touch objects in his path. With each contact, time ebbed and flowed around the items – some aged to dust, others reverted to pristine condition. Each manipulation created a new obstacle for his pursuers, buying Zephyr precious seconds in his escape.\n\nAt last, he reached a window. Pausing for just a moment, Zephyr gazed out at the surreal vista of Lumina City. Neon signs flickered in colors that shouldn't exist, advertising products and services that defied comprehension. Streets twisted like Möbius strips, looping back on themselves in ways that made Zephyr's head spin.\n\n\"Well, here goes nothing,\" he said, summoning every ounce of courage he possessed.\n\nWith that, Zephyr leaped from the window. As he fell, he concentrated on his newfound temporal abilities, willing the air around him to slow his descent. To his relief and amazement, it worked. He floated gently to the sidewalk below, landing with all the grace of a feather.\n\nLooking back up at the building he'd just fled, Zephyr saw the Shadowcrats peering down from the window. Their pocketwatch eyes spun wildly, ticking with what could only be described as fury.\n\n\"I don't know who I am or why those things are after me,\" Zephyr said to himself, a newfound determination in his voice, \"but I'm going to find out.\"\n\nWith that declaration, he turned and began to move deeper into the bizarre landscape of Lumina City. As he did, however, he noticed something troubling. Hairline fractures were spreading across the surface of his pearl, pulsing with an otherworldly light that seemed to flicker in and out of existence.\n\n\"That can't be good,\" Zephyr muttered, a note of worry creeping into his voice.\n\nAround him, the very fabric of time began to splinter. People on the street moved backwards, rewinding through their own personal histories. A nearby building aged rapidly, crumbling to dust before his eyes, only to reform anew in the next instant. Zephyr clutched his pearl, which was growing uncomfortably warm, as the world kaleidoscoped around him in a dizzying display of temporal chaos.\n\nAs reality itself seemed to fray at the edges, Zephyr realized that his journey was only just beginning.

She didn't care about being popular, whether boys liked her or got good grades.\n\n\nWinnre wanted to take photos of tombstones, and she didn't care what the park hours were, when she was supposed to be home, or whether the graveyard was built like a maze. It was basically a catacomb but above ground, but she had never paid attention to that kind of thing.\n\nWinnre had gotten it into her head recently that graveyard and grave photography was the next big thing, and she was damned if she was going to miss out on the next trend of the only hobby that actually mattered to her.\n\nWinnre entered the graveyard through the appropriate entrance, her gear at her side. She didn't look around her. She didn't read a single sign, and she didn't text her mother where she went or when she would be home. She didn't care if anyone struggled to find her because she wasn't thinking about anyone else at that moment.\n\nWinnre hardly ever thought about anyone else, period. It's why she was comfortable walking on graves to take her pictures and why she was there long after the sunset, even though her mom had been expecting her to come straight home after school.\n\nWinnre simply continued to take photos until it got too dark for her to see and too dark to take any more pictures. It was then that she looked around and realized that aside from the graveyard, she had no idea where she was. She couldn't see the fence—she couldn't see the street lights — she couldn't see any landmarks that were useful to any degree.\n\nShe tried not to panic. She had been in this graveyard before, and she should be able to find her way out. There was an entire portfolio in her bedroom filled with pictures of these headstones; she just needed to calm down and think.\n\nThink, she scolded herself. Think about which way you came in to get here.\n\nWinnre looked around, glancing at the names on the headstones, but none of them stood out to her. She didn't recognize the path she was on, and there were no footprints anywhere. There actually was hardly a visible path at all, but she didn't let it stop her. If she walked forward long enough, she would reach a gate or a street, and she would use that to take her home. It's that simple.\n\nIt should have been that simple, at least. The graveyard was a bigger one in town, but it was not infinite. There didn't exist any singular place that sprawled on forever, so it was just a matter of getting to the end.\n\nAnd so the girl walked. She tucked her stuff close to her and walked forward, making sure not to veer too far in any direction; even when she had to walk around tombstones and trees and other obstacles, she found the straight path again. That was the best way for her to get to the end of the graveyard.\n\nIt absolutely, for sure, had an end if she could find it.\n\nShe told herself this when her stomach growled because she didn't have so much as a granola bar with her. She hadn't thought about being gone for quite so long when she packed her stuff that day and ate all of her lunch stuff.\n\nWhich made sense at the time, but now I feel a bit stupid.\n\nShe kept walking anyway. The longer she went, the quieter everything seemed to get around her. Her footsteps echoed in the darkness, and the silence began to press in on her.\n\nThe headstones seemed to lean in closer, their inscriptions unreadable, even if she shined a light on them.\n\nAs the sun left her, the air grew unseasonably cold, which she tried not to think about. Instead, she continued to tell herself that nowhere had gone on forever. This place, like all others, had to have an end.\n\nAt some point, she tried to look at her phone for the time, but the clock seemed to have stopped, and by the looks of it, it had actually stopped hours ago. Winnre thought to herself that it was impossible and she just needed to restart it when she got home.\n\nWhatever it took to keep herself sane in that moment. No panicking, only walking. She had to be close to the gates.\n\nHad to be.\n\nThe few trees within the graveyard loomed over her, and it became more difficult to breathe normally.\n\nWinnre didn't care about many things beyond her photographs, but she found herself fighting with herself as she walked. She cared about the shadows, and the ache in her legs, and the branches that swayed in the breeze like fingers trying to follow her as she tried to escape.\n\nHours passed. Winnre didn't know how many because she couldn't figure out how time was passing anymore. She wondered stupidly if it was passing at all — maybe she wasn't finding her way out because she was frozen somehow, and nothing mattered at all.\n\nWhen her feet began to cramp from walking too much in one day, she sank against a tombstone and tried not to think about who was underneath her.\n\nExhaustion took over, forcing her heavy eyelids to close even though she swore she heard whispers drawing near.\n\nWhen her eyes opened again, the air around her was taken over by a deep mist. Shadows moved at the edge of her vision, and when she tried to stand to get away from them, her body refused to obey.\n\nThere was no standing up, and there was no finding her way out. Winnre wanted more than anything to fight herself, to wake up from the lame dream she was having, but when a hand grabbed her shoulder to pull her further down, she stopped letting herself have the thoughts.\n\nShe wasn't leaving the graveyard.\n\nAnd to think, she had just wanted to take some pictures.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

The park's rules, the expectations of her mother, the ticking clock of her day—all fell away as she stepped through the iron gates. Here, in the embrace of the cold marble, was where Winnie found her pulse, her truth.\n\nArmed with her gear, she wove through the graves, her footsteps a challenge to the quietude. Each photograph was a verse in her personal epic, a testament to her defiance of the ordinary. The twilight bloomed into night, indifferent to her pursuit of the extraordinary, yet she pressed on, the graveyard's maze a testament to her unwavering focus.\n\nBut as the stars took their watch, a somber silence descend, and Winnie realized the weight of her isolation. The paths blurred, the landmarks eluded her, and the graveyard seemed to breathe, an entity of its own right. The portfolio in her room, once a testament to her familiarity, now mocked her from a distance. Panic, a visitor unwelcome, threatened to unsteady her resolve.\n\nDetermination, however, was the child of despair's sibling. She would walk, she would find her way. The graveyard, vast and daunting, had an end. She had entered; she would leave. With each step, she willed the end to appear, the gates to yield to her persistence.\n\nYet the longer she wandered, the more the graveyard seemed to whisper, to shift under her feet. The air, once crisp, grew heavy, suffocating. The trees, gnarled fingers reaching into the night, bore whispers on the wind. Her stomach growled, a reminder of the passage of time, the world outside her pursuit forgotten.\n\nThe hours unfolded like a morose tale, the sun a distant memory, the moon a cold spectator. Her phone, once a beacon of civilization, lay dormant, its light extinguished by the gravity of the place. The graveyard, vast and relentless, seemed to consume time, as if it dwelled in a realm outside the ticking of clocks.\n\nExhaustion, a relentless hunter, whispered its finality into her ear, her legs rebelling, her body a temple of fatigue. But it was in this weariness that the veil between worlds grew thin. The mist, a spectral shroud, descended, and from it emerged shadows, ethereal and terrifying. Whispers, like the caress of the dead, entwined with the wind, beckoning, compelling.\n\nIn that moment of primal fear, a hand, spectral and insubstantial, grazed her shoulder. A force, unseen yet palpable, pulled at her, a call from the beyond. The graveyard, once a backdrop to her art, now a trap, a realm where the living had no dominion. Winnie, her once fierce will diminished, succumbed to the embrace of the eternal.\n\nAnd as she surrendered to the mist, the graveyard claimed its prize, a soul ensnared by the pursuit of the unseen, the untouched. The photographs, frozen in time, remained, a testament to a life once lived in defiance of the ordinary, now eternally part of the story of the graveyard, where the ordinary met the supernatural, and the pursuit of the extraordinary led to an entombment of the soul.", "checklist_wise_evaluation": [{"checklist_id": 0, "reason": "The generated text captures the Kingian style well, incorporating everyday settings with relatable characters and elements of horror and suspense.

All they said was I should ask you and that I'd be having a long night ahead of me\".\n\nHartford chuckled softly. \"Fuckers.. Alright I'll make this simple\".\n\nThey then stopped at a ladder propped up against the trench line and he pointed at a dead corpse stuck on a string of barbed wire between them and the enemy trenches.\n\n\"You see the stiff over there?\" Hartford asked.\n\n\"Murray\". Dixon corrected him. \"I knew him, his name was Murray\".\n\n\"It doesn't matter\" Hartford answered. \"He's dead now and command wants us to get him and his friends off that wire and out of sight from our men. They say it damages the morale\".\n\nDixon stared at Murray's cold dead eyes that pierced through the darkness and nodded. He had several friends that didn't make it back from the previous attack and he now understood why his superiors didn't tell him the details about his assignment.\n\n\"Anyways you don't have to bury them or anything, just take them off the wires so they can't be seen. We'll use the moon as our only source of light and divide ourselves. You'll be going West and I'll be East and we'll meet back here in five minutes, understood?\"\n\nDixon nodded and Hartford stuck a pair of wire cutters in his hand and removed his helmet while Dixon did the same before he asked \"What do I do if they're still alive? The attack only happened a few hours ago. I've heard stories that men can rot out there for days on that wire.\"\n\nHartford only shook his head. \"Don't make yourself a target. Just take care of the bodies and get back safe. I don't want to bury another replacement\".\n\nWith that Hartford rubbed some mud on his face and crawled out of the trench and Dixon did the same a moment later.\n\nIt was hard at first. The stench from the bodies made Dixon gag and the flies were annoyed that someone was interrupting their meal. But the worst part at all was looking at them.\n\nBut by the third body, Dixon just shut his nose and nearly ripped them off the wire without so much as even glancing at their faces.\n\nHe then came to the last one in his sector and put the wire cutter to the man's arm when the living man jerked and shouted.\n\nDixon panicked and hit the ground as the man began to plead in the darkness. \"Please! Please help me!\"\n\nDixon slid his hand over the man's mouth. \"It's okay I'm here.. Listen, I'm going to get you out of here but you have to be quiet.\"\n\nThe man agreed and did his best to be quiet when Dixon began to cut him from the barbed wire. But the pain of flesh ripping from metal made him nearly scream in anguish and Dixon tried his best to calm him down.\n\n\"Hey, do you have a family?\" Dixon asked as he finished tearing his leg off the wire.\n\nThe man nodded \"I have two daughters.. Oh my God, I've barely thought about them all this time. Listen, you have to tell them I love them if I don't make it out of here.\"\n\nDixon stared at the enemy trench line as he held his breath for a moment and then kept cutting \"Tell them yourself when you get out of here.\"\n\nHe then ripped his other leg away and the man screamed in pain again as a sniper's bullet ripped into the ground beside them.\n\nDixon dropped the wire cutters and cussed his bad luck before helping the man to his feet but he shook his head. \"I can't walk.. I can't feel my legs.\"\n\nThe sniper's aim got better and a bullet struck the post next to Dixon's head as he picked the man up and carried him.\n\nCold blood began leaking all over his back as Dixon ran and more shots rang out in the night.\n\n\"You're going to be okay I promise. Just think about your daughters we're almost there.\" Dixon tried to comfort the man as more blood ran down his back.\n\nThe sentry at the trench line began shooting back at the sniper and Dixon nearly collapsed as they fell into the trench where Hartford was there waiting for him.\n\n\"What happened?\" He asked angrily. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nDixon immediately stood up and grabbed the man's hand to drag him. \"Give me a hand, this man needs to see a medic immediately or he's going to die\".\n\nHartford flipped over the man's corpse and shook his head. \"You've wasted your time. I'm sorry but this man's already dead.\"\n\nDixon looked down and saw a fresh bullet wound through the man's neck and his cold dead eyes staring back at him.\n\n\"I promised him he'd be okay,\" Dixon said staring at his hands that were now caked in blood.\n\nHartford patted Dixon on the back and knelt beside him. \"I can take care of him. Get to a dressing station and clean yourself off\".\n\nDixon did as he was told and slumped off to the rear trench line as Hartford checked the man's body and found a set of ID tags and a photograph of two little girls with an address scribbled on the back.\n\n\"Great\". He muttered. \"One more letter I have to mail out.\"\n\nHe then slid the photograph in his uniform next to the others.\"\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Through the fog of his confusion, a stern visage emerged—Sergeant Hartford.\n\nDixon nodded, an automatic response to what felt like a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"Good,\" Hartford's voice was as brusque as a whip. \"Leave your rifle. Follow me.\"\n\nThey emerged from the dugout into a night that seemed to have thickened, as if the darkness itself were a tangible substance. Dixon squinted, struggling to make sense of a landscape that appeared warped, twisted by the surreal.\n\n\"Do you know why you're here?\" Hartford’s question sliced through the night.\n\n\"No.\" Dixon's answer was a simple acknowledgment of his disorientation. \"They didn't elaborate. All I was told was to ask you and brace for a long night.\"\n\nHartford’s chuckle was mirthless. \"Well, let's make it simple then.\"\n\nA ladder leaned against the trench line, a silent sentinel to a macabre duty. Hartford pointed to a gruesome sight: a corpse, Murray, impaled on a string of barbed wire that stretched towards the enemy lines. His eyes, lifeless yet somehow piercing, reflected the moon's sickly light.\n\n\"See the stiff there?\" Hartford's voice was devoid of any semblance of empathy. \"He's dead now. Command wants him and his comrades off that wire. They say it's morale-damaging for our men to see them.\"\n\nDixon’s chest tightened. He knew too well the cost of war, the faces that didn’t return. But this—this task— seemed a particularly grotesque absurdity.\n\n\"The moon will be our only light,\" Hartford continued, ignoring Dixon’s internal turmoil. \"We'll split up, moving East and West. Meet back here in five minutes. Understood?\"\n\nDixon’s nod was a gesture of resignation. He was handed wire cutters and removed his helmet, a symbolic stripping away of his protection.\n\nHartford's last words echoed in the depths of the trench: \"Don't make yourself a target. Just get the bodies off the wire. I don't want to bury another replacement.\"\n\nThe two men crawled out, their figures swallowed by the night. Dixon approached the first body, his nose wrinkling at the stench that seemed to rise from the mud itself. Flies buzzed around, indifferent to the human drama unfolding.\n\nThe third body proved the breaking point—he began to rip at it with frenetic energy, barely acknowledging the face that gazed up at him, lifeless. Then, the last man in his sector stirred, a pitiful whisper breaking the silence.\n\n“Please, help me!”\n\nDixon’s heart clenched. He covered the man’s mouth, a gesture meant to silence the plea. “I’m here, I’ll get you out. But you must be quiet.”\n\nThe man nodded, pain etched in his features. “I have two daughters… Please tell them I love them if—”\n\nHis words were cut short by a sniper’s bullet that struck the ground too close for comfort. Dixon dropped the wire cutters and swore under his breath. The man was now unable to walk, his legs severed from his body.\n\n\"Think of your daughters,\" Dixon urged, carrying the weight of the man’s anguish.\n\nThe sniper's aim grew more precise, bullets striking closer. Dixon felt the cold blood of death leaking down his back. The sentry at the trench line began to shoot back, but it was too late.\n\nHartford waited at the trench line, his anger palpable. “What happened?”\n\nDixon slumped next to him, the corpse now in his arms. “I tried to save him. He was alive.”\n\nHartford flipped the man's corpse over, shaking his head. “You’ve wasted your time. He’s dead.”\n\nThe promise to the man’s daughters hung thick in the air, an unfulfilled vow. Hartford took the bullet-riddled body and found ID tags, a photograph of two little girls, and an address scribbled on the back.\n\n\"Another letter to write,\" he muttered, sliding the photograph into his uniform next to the others.\n\nDixon watched, his hands still caked in blood, his spirit weary.

You'll get fat!\"\n\nThe sounds stopped.\n\nThe simple wooden desk in his bedroom was a mess of papers, but he knew where everything was. His lamp began to flicker erratically, so he turned on the overhead light.\n\nThere had been multiple busy news cycles, and he had been burning the candle at both ends for months. Grant told himself that it was worth tolerating this for the cheap rent. It was too late to regret taking out student loans for a journalism degree.\n\nSo far, he'd been unable to convince even a single person other than his landlord that he was being obnoxiously haunted. On the rare occasions women stayed overnight, they thought he had set up some elaborate, poor taste prank and never spoke to him again.\n\nHe rewrote his last paragraph until he was happy with it. The opener was a little sensationalist for the fairly respectable publication employing him, so he fixed it.\n\nThe feeling that someone was looking over his shoulder was unshakable. He already had an editor like that and was annoyed.\n\nFinally submitting his article at 3 am was a relief. There was still a little of the scotch his brother had gifted him for his birthday, so he poured a few shots in the nicest glass that had not yet been smashed by the stupid ghost.\n\nSomeone knocked decisively at the door. He was shocked to open it and discover it was the police. He had just submitted a scathing article regarding their handling of a recent peaceful protest, and in his slightly inebriated state wondered how they had found out so fast.\n\n\"Your neighbors called in a noise complaint. What's going on?\"\n\nGrant felt that explaining that it was just the ghost lacked a certain something, so he told them the TV had been turned up loud, and it was off now.\n\nThat was apparently acceptable.\n\n------\n\nHis landlord, who lived in the apartment above him, came to check on him the next morning. He was awake. He remembered sleep fondly from his youth.\n\nIt was necessary to move some books and papers off the kitchen table to sit and have a cup of coffee with Mrs. Hawke. He often felt that his cheerful, yellow kitchen was completely inappropriate, but it was three bus transfers to a store that sold paint. An unregarded wall clock ticked away time, oblivious to daylight savings. The only thing required of it was to count twelve minutes for hard boiled eggs, but one day it would be accurate again.\n\n\"The ghost was slamming shut cabinet doors, and someone called in a noise complaint. That's why the cops came.\"\n\nMrs. Hawke was not without sympathy. Most people only saw as far as her stern, steel gray bun and plain clothing, failing to notice her compassionate, warm brown eyes past her resting bitch face.\n\n\"How is that going? Is there anything I can do?\"\n\n\"Research is ongoing,\" he said. \"I'm having a difficult time finding a good source. Mostly what people have to say about ghosts sounds insane. Do I sound like that when I try to tell other people?\"\n\nShe took a sip of her coffee, but it was still a little too hot, so she set it down.\n\n\"Probably, honestly. I hope you're not unhappy. You've lasted longer here than anyone ever has before.\"\n\nGrant stirred some creamer into his sturdy mug, just happy he had Maxwell House at this point.\n\n\"I honor my commitments. You did outright tell me this place is haunted up front. I just didn't believe you at the time. Have you tried anything to get rid of the ghost?\"\n\nMrs. Hawke said, \"Well, I tried to burn some sage, but it only triggered my asthma. Then, me and my nephew tried to cast the spirit out with a passage from the Bible, but he's an atheist, and I'm agnostic. Our hearts just weren't in it. It was kind of embarrassing, and then the bookmark fell out, so we just kind of left.\"\n\nThis was not extremely helpful.\n\n------\n\nHe met Luka by chance, and couldn't help but want to spend any free moment with her.\n\nGrant thought that Luka was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. Luka thought that crystals and random plants had mystical healing powers. He had finally found someone who believed him. He seemed to spend a lot of time trying to convince her to stop shoving all his garlic in her ears to treat her ear infection, but he was actually really happy dating her.\n\nOne night the ghost was tossing around the furniture, and Luka intervened.\n\n\"Hey, it's ok. Everyone gets angry,\" she said, \"I mean, this morning the dryer tore holes in my favorite leggings, and I was pretty angry. You're damned to wander the earth in eternal torment, and you're pretty angry. I mean, I understand.\"\n\nGrant was shocked when the ghost spoke for the first time, with a bold man's voice.\n\n\"Is this bitch for real?\"\n\nLuka seized the opportunity to open a dialouge, earnestly telling the ghost about the cosmic harmony of the universe, nature, and the importance of feelings and expression.\n\n\"I'm moving in at the end of the month,\" she said, \"and I'm sure we'll be great friends, and talk about these things a lot.\"\n\nAgain, a voice came from nowhere.\n\n\"I'm out.\"\n\nIt took a while for Grant to feel sure that the ghost was gone, but it was never an issue again.

The cacophony, a specter’s manifestation in the realm of the mundane, clashed with Grant’s besieged psyche, a harbinger of impending deadlines that loomed over his existence like the spectral visage of an unseen tormentor.\n\nHe, the weary scribe, perched upon his tenuous throne of a desk, a labyrinth of scattered parchments and the detritus of his toils spread wide across the expanse. The lamp, a flickering sentinel, wavered in its allegiance to the nocturnal realm, forcing him to summon forth the celestial glow of the overhead diadem that hung precariously from the ceiling’s embrace.\n\nGrant’s mind, a tempest of clashing thoughts and frenetic energy, berated him for the folly of his academic pursuits—the journalism degree, an echo of a bygone era, a relic of a time when ink and paper were the vessels of truth. Yet, he persisted, bound by the shackles of student loans and the fleeting hope of redemption in the eyes of a world that seemed to mock his endeavors from afar.\n\nThe whispers of an unseen observer, a phantom companion to his labors, taunted him, invasive and unwelcome. He scoffed at the notion of spectral intruders—the mere idea a specter of madness in the mind of a rational man. Yet, the women who graced his abode, transient as the morning dew, found his nocturnal guest a reason to depart, their voices fading into the ethereal realm of non-return.\n\nGrant, pen in hand, sculpted the essence of his thoughts into the malleable clay of prose, a laborious craft to please the unforgiving gaze of his editor and the dispassionate public. A scathing indictment of law enforcement’s handling of a peaceful protest lay before him, a testament to his own defiance in the face of the status quo. The submission, a triumphant declaration of his integrity, was a bittersweet victory as the hourglass of time drained the last remnants of a scotch that once warmed his soul.\n\nA knock, resolute and demanding, shattered the equilibrium of his solitude. The door creaked open, revealing an embodiment of authority, a manifestation of the night’s capricious mirth. The explanation that the tumult was but the handiwork of a spectral denizen seemed a precariously thin veil over the truth. Instead, the television’sVolume’s raucous celebration provided a more palatable explanation, an acceptable scapegoat for the disturbance.\n\nDawn, with the tenderness of a mother’s caress, graced his abode the following morn. Mrs. Hawke, the sentinel above, descended from her lofty perch to commiserate in the yellowed glow of his kitchen sanctum. Books and papers, the remnants of Grant’s nocturnal exertions, made way for the rituals of morning as they shared the bitter elixir that was coffee. The clock, an indifferent sentinel, marked time with the indifference of one that had long forsaken the conventions of day and night.\n\n“The nocturnal clamor, a ghostly orchestration, summoned the guardians of order.” Grant recounted, his voice a weary melody of resignation. Mrs. Hawke, beneath her steely exterior, harbored a well of empathy that belied her severe countenance.\n\n“The quest to exorcise this spectral interloper continues.” Grant mused, his voice a mere shadow of the conviction that pulsed within his breast. “Does my tale of woe echo that of a madman, or might others find solace in my words?”\n\nLuka, an unexpected oasis in the desert of solitude, entered his world with the grace of an angel and the wisdom of a sage. Her belief in the mystical harmonies of the universe was a balm to his beleaguered spirit. Their union, born of chance, blossomed into a sanctuary of shared understanding. The ghost, enraged and restless, found its voice, a challenge to the world that dared to encroach upon its domain.\n\n“Anger is but a reflection of the soul’s unrest.” Luka intoned, her voice a beacon of reason in the tempest of the spectral's fury. Yet, the ghost, unyielding and defiant, departed with the finality of a storm retreating into the horizon, its departure as mysterious as its arrival.\n\nIn the aftermath, the world resumed its measured pace, the echoes of the night’s tumult fading into the annals of memory.
