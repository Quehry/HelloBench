http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/ ) , ucsc human genome browser ( ucsc database .\nwhen the cnvs reported in the databases or papers were too small to be detected by our bac - acgh methods , we assumed that they were different from our cnvs .\nthe cnv data obtained in our studies , including an indication of the presence or absence of cnvs already reported in other databases , are summarized in tables 1 and 2 .\ncompared to caucasian populations , very little information about cnvs in japanese populations has been systematically screened .\nwe compared our data with the data of japanese populations from the hapmap project as reported by redon et al . ,\nin addition to the data by bac array , three groups , including redon et al .\n, reported the data of japanese populations based on examinations conducted using oligo - array methods , although each group used a different array platform [ 24 , 25 ] .\nthese results are also summarized in tables 1 and 2 . in the case where a multiple number of cnvs were identified in our study ( table 1 ) ,\nmoreover , regarding one individual , the cnvs identified in nine of 27 bac regions were reported in the data reported by the others , although we should emphasize again that the cnvs identified in our bac region are not exactly the same as those reported by the others .\nthe majority of cnvs identified in our study tend not to be identified in the other reports .\nwe summarized some of the genes and disease - related genes that overlap with the bac - clone region for our cnvs ( table 3 ) .\nin addition , mrnas also have been reported in the databases , but they are too numerous to describe here .\nall bac - clone regions contained at least one mrna , although the functions of a majority of the mrnas are not yet known ( data not shown ) .\nwe examined 213 unrelated japanese individuals using bac - acgh and found a total of 126 cnvs on 52 different bac regions in the genomes .\nthe cnvs observed on 27 of the 52 bac - regions were found in only one unrelated individual .\nthe family studies were conducted for 23 cnvs , and the results demonstrated that these were inherited from one of the parents .\na fraction of the regions involved in the cnvs observed in our study ( i.e. , 34 of 126 or about 27% ; tables 1 and 2 ) were not reported previously in other studies listed in the database .\nthus , they are considered novel cnvs . in contrast , the data of highly polymorphic cnvs   demonstrated that only 8% ( 55 of 680 ) had not been reported .\nthis result showed that a significantly large number of novel cnvs have been identified among relatively less frequent cnvs (  = 36.64 , p = 5.10  10 ) .\nthis finding suggests that the structural rearrangements for creating less frequent cnvs are evolutionarily recent .\nwe thus paid attention to differences in the number of cnvs identified in hiroshima compared to nagasaki .\nwith respect to the cnvs observed multiple times , 12 of 25 were identified in one city .\nthese cnvs appear to be so - called  private polymorphisms  occurring more recently than the others . on the other hand , quite a small number ( 21 of 126 ; about 17% ) of the cnvs in this report were found on the bac clones that overlapped with segmental duplication ( tables 1 and 2 ) . a majority ( about 63% ) of highly polymorphic cnvs ,\nhowever , were observed on the bac - clone overlapping with segmental duplication ( see table 1 in ) .\nthis result suggests that segmental duplication might play a significant role in the creation of highly polymorphic cnvs .\nthese observations are supported by previous data from sharp et al . , who reported the sharing of cnvs among several populations , meaning that the specific genomic imbalances either predated the migration of modern humans from africa or arose independently in different populations .\non the other hand , the data representing japanese populations are based on reports from three groups .\nwe compared our cnv data to that of these other reports [ 4 , 24 , 25 ] .\nthe cnvs found in 27 of 52 bac regions ( about 52% ) were not identified by the other groups .\nspeculation as to the reason for this includes the possibility that since the cnvs were private polymorphisms as mentioned above , they were not identified in the japanese populations used in the other works . in humans , it is estimated that around 23% of currently known cnvs reside in known or putative genes .\nmany cnvs that lie outside genic regions of the genome may still have a significant influence on gene expression by affecting gene regulatory elements .\nanother important area of exploration is linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) , that is , nonrandom association between alleles at different loci , between cnvs and other genomic variants ( especially snps ) , which may provide important insight into the genomic evolution ( e.g. , the recombination patterns ) of cnvs [ 31 , 32 ] .\nhowever , studies of ld between cnvs and snps are hindered by the fact that cnvs generally reside in genomic regions associated with segmental duplications and/or repeat - rich regions , which are difficult to sequence and use for detection of snps .\nrecent association studies have attempted to link cnvs with expression profiles , diseases , and known phenotypic differences . on the other hand , distribution of cnvs\ndiffers depending on genetic background , and population - specific cnvs might account for the divergence of some physiological traits and disease prevalence among populations .\nlike snps , cnvs also show variability among populations ; therefore , comprehensive cnv information is needed when applying cnvs as genetic markers in disease or trait studies . for the reasons cited above\n, we made plans to accumulate japanese data in which we provide information about the relation between japanese cnv data and phenotypic differences correlated with reported diseases . in our previous paper , we summarized such data by focusing on highly polymorphic cnvs found in 5.0% of the individuals .\nmore recent studies based on advanced molecular technologies , such as genome - wide association studies [ 33 , 34 ] and next generation sequencing [ 35 , 36 ] , reported that many genes appear to play important roles in the etiology of common diseases .\ndepending on newly developed technologies , rare variations have recently received attention from scientists who espouse a hypothesis called  common disease and rare variants .\n in this paper , we summarized cnvs that were identified in fewer than 10 individuals in our previous population study .\nwe focused on genes reported in the dgv , ucsc , and ncbi databases ( table 3 ) , although many mrnas were also listed in them .\nsince these genes are good candidate markers for enabling us to examine the etiology of common diseases and phenotypical heterogeneities among individuals , our cnvs have the potential to become useful markers in future studies .\nin this study , 34 cnvs were new , indicating that cnv coverage of the human genome is still incomplete and that there is diversity between the japanese and other ethnic populations .\nmoreover , the cnvs found in about two - thirds of the bac regions examined in our study were not identified in the studies in which three groups examine japanese populations using different array platforms .\nthe newly identified cnvs extend the coverage of cnvs in the human genome ( also the general japanese population ) .\nmoreover , it is expected that the cnvs could now be taken into consideration when genetic studies , for example , cnv association studies , are conducted . \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nIntroduction\nEconomic factors, new technologies, environmental concerns and associated regulatory policies, and other developments are changing the energy sources used to generate electricity in the United States. One notable change is increased generation from variable renewable energy (VRE) sources such as wind and solar. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), combined generation from wind and solar sources increased from 1% of total electricity generation in 2008 to 9% of total electricity generation in 2018. These sources have weather-dependent availability, meaning that changing weather patterns can change available electricity supply from those sources. In contrast, conventional sources for electricity generation, such as coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy, are usually available under normal weather conditions. Power system operators have adjusted existing reliability standards and planning practices to accommodate weather-dependent wind and solar sources. Further adjustments are being discussed as generation from wind and solar sources continue to grow. \nCongress required the setting and enforcement of electric reliability standards in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58 ). These standards are developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the United States. These mandatory standards apply to the bulk power system, which is comprised mostly of large-scale generators and electricity transmission systems. Small-scale generators (e.g., rooftop solar electricity generation), publicly owned utilities, and local electricity distribution systems are generally under the jurisdiction of state public utility regulatory commissions (PUCs).\nTo date, generation from wind and solar sources does not appear to be causing electric reliability issues at the national level. NERC's 2018 annual report on reliability showed that, of the 13 metrics it uses to assess reliability, 9 were stable or improving over the 2013-2017 period and 4 showed trends that were, at least partly, inconclusive. Of the four metrics with inconclusive trends, three improved over this period for a subset of bulk power system components. Data from NERC also indicate that reliability performance is currently stable in regions such as the Midwest and California where the shares of generation from wind and solar sources are above the national average. Questions remain about how higher levels of generation from wind and solar sources might impact electric reliability moving forward. \nThis report provides background on reliability planning in the United States with an emphasis on the effects of daily and seasonal variability in wind and solar sources on the bulk power system. Members of Congress might consider how reliability could be impacted if generation from wind and solar sources increases, as many analysts expect. Other reliability concerns, such as cyber and physical security, small-scale generators, and local distribution networks, may be of interest to Congress but are not discussed at length in this report.\nElectric Power Sector Overview\nAs shown in Figure 1 the electric power sector consists primarily of three systems. The generation system consists of power plants that generate electricity. The transmission system consists of high voltage transmission lines that move power across long distances. The distribution systems make final delivery of electricity to homes and businesses. This report will refer to the combined generation and transmission systems as the bulk power system, following the definition Congress established in EPACT05: \nThe term \"bulk-power system\" meansâ(a) facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network (or any portion thereof); and\n(b) electric energy from generation facilities needed to maintain transmission system reliability.\nThe term does not include facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy.\nNotably, the discussion in this report generally excludes distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar electricity generation. These resources might pose separate reliability challenges that Congress might choose to consider.\nOwnership structures for bulk power system components vary across the country. In some regions, shown in Figure 2 , competitive markets exist for wholesale electric power, and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) manage the generation and transmission components of the power system. In RTO regions, electricity generators compete to sell power to distribution utilities. The RTO manages an auction process to select the sources for generation that distribution utilities resell to end-use customers. The RTO is also responsible for managing the transmission system and overseeing reliability within its boundaries. In RTO regions, market signals primarily determine investment decisions. Some RTOs operate separate auction processes specifically for essential reliability services. According to FERC, two-thirds of U.S. electricity demand comes from RTO regions. \nIn non-RTO regions, vertically integrated electric utilities are largely responsible for power generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity to end-use customers. These utilities are regulated as natural monopolies and, unlike utilities in RTO regions, do not face competition for generation and transmission services. These utilities may also take responsibility for some aspects of reliability as discussed in the Appendix . State regulators generally oversee these utility operations and are responsible for authorizing new investments, including those related to reliability. \nEven in RTO regions, municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives may own generation and transmission system components and oversee their operation. These systems and operation are generally outside of federal and state regulatory jurisdiction.\nWhat Is Electric Reliability?\nA colloquial definition of electric reliability is \"having power when it is needed.\" Operators of bulk power system components, though, require specific and highly technical definitions for reliability. For purposes of regulation, these definitions are provided in the form of NERC reliability standards. NERC develops individual standards for each set of power system components, which may include separate standards covering different reliability timescales for each set of components. As NERC defines \"reliability standard,\" it\nincludes requirements for the operation of existing Bulk-Power System facilities, including cybersecurity protection, and the design of planned additions or modifications to such facilities to the extent necessary to provide for Reliable Operation of the Bulk-Power System, but the term does not include any requirement to enlarge such facilities or to construct new transmission capacity or generation capacity.\nWhen all bulk power system components meet reliability standards, NERC expects the vast majority of individuals to have the full amount of electricity they desire. NERC reliability standards do not apply to local electricity distribution system components and operations (see discussion in text box, \"Distribution System Reliability\"), so localized outages could still occur when reliability standards are met. An analysis found that from 2008 to 2014, upwards of 90% of power outages originated in local distribution systems. This measure includes major events (e.g., hurricanes), but may not capture the full scope or severity of large-scale outages.\nNERC's reliability standards are meant to ensure an Adequate Level of Reliability (ALR) for the bulk power system during normal operating conditions and following localized disturbances such as lightning strikes. For economic reasons, some risk of occasional power loss is accepted in reliability planning. A common goal is to limit outages to no more than 1 day every 10 years under normal operating conditions. \nAchieving ALR is not the same goal as preventing all brownouts and blackouts. Bulk power system outages could still occur when reliability standards are fully met. These outages might follow a major event such as a hurricane affecting large areas of the bulk power system. \nGenerally, factors that increase uncertainty reduce reliability, and factors that reduce uncertainty increase reliability. Wind and solar are types of variable renewable energy sources of electricity, and weather is a key source of uncertainty for forecasts of generation from these sources. In contrast, conventional sources such as coal and nuclear have long-lasting, on-site fuel supplies that reduce the uncertainty about their availability. This difference has raised questions about how to integrate large amounts of VRE sources into the existing bulk power system, since it was not originally designed to accommodate large amounts of weather-dependent sources of electricity. \n Figure 3 shows typical patterns for electricity generation for wind and solar sources in the United States. Wind generation tends to peak overnight and during winter months. Solar generation, on the other hand, tends to be highest during the middle of the day and during the summer. Though these typical patterns are well established for most of the United States, actual generation from wind and solar sources at any particular moment will depend upon specific weather conditions.\nChanging Electricity Generation Profile\nThe electric power sector is increasing its use of sources associated with more uncertainty in availability. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, combined generation from wind and utility-scale solar sources increased from 1% of total electricity generation in 2008 to 8% of total electricity generation in 2018. Of the generation in 2018 from wind and utility-scale solar sources, 80% came from wind. Conventional sources such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear comprised a large majority of generation over this time period. The annual share of generation from different sources from 2008 to 2018 in shown in Figure 4 .\nNational-level data are not indicative of how generation from wind and solar sources varies across the country. Similarly, annual data do not show how electricity generation varies throughout the day or during different seasons. For example, during brief periods in some regions, wind and solar sources have provided a majority of the energy for electricity generation. Some examples are \nGeneration from wind sources supplied 56% of electricity demand in ERCOT, the RTO covering most of Texas, at 3:10 am on January 19, 2019. Generation from solar sources supplied 59% of electricity demand in CAISO, the RTO covering most of California, at 2:45 pm on March 16, 2019. Generation from wind supplied 67.3% of electricity demand in SPP, the RTO covering many central states, at 1:25 am on April 27, 2019.\nThese events all set records for maximum share of generation from renewable sources, and the bulk power system maintained reliability during them. Some advocates for increased use of wind and solar sources have pointed to events like these as evidence that VRE sources can be used to an even greater degree without impacting reliability. \nExtrapolating these events to scenarios of correspondingly high national levels of generation from wind and solar sources, however, is complicated by several factors. First, these events were all short lived, typically five minutes or less. Further, these events all occurred when electricity demand was relatively low, namely weekend days during cool months. During times of the year when electricity demand is high, such as the summer cooling season, the share of electricity generation from renewable sources is lower. For example, SPP has reported that during its peak demand hours in 2016, wind supplied 11% of generation while conventional sources such as coal (47%) and natural gas (33%) supplied the majority of electricity. The seasonality of VRE availability also likely contributed to these record-setting events, especially for wind, which tends to have maximum generation during winter and spring months. \nBalancing Variable Renewable Energy\nElectricity is essentially generated as a just-in-time commodity, due to limited energy storage capacities. If electricity supply and demand differ by too much, system components could be damaged, leading to system instability or potential failure. The operations that keep electricity supply and demand within acceptable levels are known as balancing.\nBalancing involves increasing or decreasing output from generators according to system conditions over timescales of minutes to hours, and it is a critical aspect of maintaining reliability. Balancing authorities, discussed in the Appendix , issue orders to generators to change their output as needed to maintain reliability. Balancing authorities can be utilities, or RTOs can act as balancing authorities in the regions where they exist. The rules for selecting which generators must increase or decrease output typically reflect an approach known as security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED). Under SCED, system operators ensure that electricity is produced at the lowest overall cost while respecting any transmission or operational constraints. When generation from a low-cost source would jeopardize reliability, a higher-cost source is used. In other words, SCED has two goals: affordability and reliability.\nSCED favors sources with low operating costs, and wind and solar sources do not have to pay for fuel. As a result, wind and solar sources typically generate the maximum amount of electricity they can at any moment. Balancing typically involves quickly increasing or decreasing output from other sources in response to variable output from wind and solar sources. The capability to quickly change output is known as ramping, and electricity sources differ in their ramping capability. \nSystem operators use a variety of electricity sources to balance generation from wind and solar sources. Some may be more commonly used in certain regions of the country, depending on local factors. Each has different benefits and limitations, some of which are summarized below. \nReciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) have seen an increase in installed capacity since 2000, partly in response to higher levels of generation from wind and solar sources. These sources have high ramping capabilities and use mature technologies. They usually use natural gas or fuel oil as fuel, so they have associated fuel costs and environmental impacts. Steam turbines, usually fueled by coal or nuclear energy , have historically been operated at steady, high output levels, barring maintenance needs, because that is the most efficient and lowest cost operational mode for them. These sources are capable of ramping to some extent. This operational mode may provide revenue for certain sources located in regions of the country with low wholesale electricity prices. It might also result in higher costs for electricity from these sources, compared to when they are not ramped. Wind and solar sources located in one area can balance wind and solar sources in other areas, since it is rare to have cloudy skies or calm winds over broad regions of the country simultaneously. This could have the benefit of using sources with zero fuel costs and zero emissions for balancing; however, existing electricity transmission system constraints limit the extent to which this is possible. Energy storage can be used for balancing because it stores electricity during periods of high supply and then provides electricity when supply is low. Many experts also see storage as a way to address the daily variability shown in Figure 3 and thereby expand the utilization of installed wind and solar sources. Many energy storage types are expensive and not currently deployed in large amounts. Energy storage can be co-located with wind or solar generators, or it can be located at other sites in the power system or the distribution system. Demand response, sometimes called demand-side management, involves adjusting electricity demand in response to available supply. This is counter to how the power system has historically been operated, but has become more commonly used. Demand response includes programs in which electricity consumers voluntarily reduce their usage in exchange for financial compensation. Demand response can be a low-cost balancing option because it does not require electricity generation; however, it comes at a social cost because consumers do not use electricity at their preferred time.The electric power sector is working to improve the use of weather and power forecasting in system balancing. For example, MISO changed its wholesale electricity market rules in 2011 to create a Dispatchable Intermittent Resources program. This program allows wind sources to make use of their own generation forecasts and offer generation at five-minute intervals. Previously, offers had to be made on an hourly basis. This was creating inefficiencies in using wind sources since their output can vary over the course of an hour. Improved forecasting could result in increased use of low-cost wind and solar sources, but forecasting methodologies are still being optimized for this purpose.\nThe above considerations apply to bulk power system balancing today. Technological or policy developments could alter how system balancing is conducted in the future. Additionally, if wind and solar sources provided even larger shares of overall generation, new benefits or limitations for each balancing source type could emerge.\nFederal Government Activities Affecting Reliability and Balancing\nWork at the federal level to address reliability needs associated with increased use of wind and solar sources has been underway for some time. For example, NERC created a task force in December 2007 to study the integration of VRE and identify gaps in reliability standards.\nThe federal government undertakes actions in addition to the development and enforcement of reliability standards that affect electric reliability. FERC regulates interstate electricity transmission, which can be a key determinant of what sources are available to balance wind and solar. FERC also regulates wholesale electricity markets in most regions of the country. Market rules, including how SCED is implemented, can influence which individual generators are used for system balancing. Market prices can directly affect project revenues and influence investment decisions. Additionally, Congress funds projects and programs that support technology development and deployment, including for sources and operations that improve reliability.\nSome examples demonstrate the breadth of federal activities related to reliability. \nIn EPACT05, Congress created Section 219 of the Federal Power Act that directs FERC to establish financial incentives for certain electricity transmission investments. FERC's resulting rule became effective in 2006 and includes provisions allowing higher rates of return, accelerated depreciation, and full cost recovery, all for investments and activities that FERC approves on a case-by-case basis. Transmission investment has increased since the passage of EPACT05, although there may be many factors driving this investment. On March 21, 2019, FERC opened an inquiry on potential changes to its transmission incentive policy. In 2011, FERC issued a rule, Order No. 1000, revising requirements related to new transmission projects. Among other revisions, Order No. 1000 increased the weight given to achieving public policy requirements when FERC considers approval of transmission projects. An example of a public policy requirement might be a state requirement that a specified share of electricity sales come from renewable sources, a policy commonly known as a renewable portfolio standard. New transmission capacity is often needed to access and balance wind and solar sources. Several FERC orders demonstrate how market rules are changing in response to increased need for balancing and ramping. Order No. 745 allows demand response to earn compensation from wholesale electricity markets for providing energy services to balance the power system in day-ahead and real-time markets. Order No. 841 allows energy storage systems to earn compensation from wholesale electricity markets for providing any energy, capacity, and essential reliability services they are capable of providing. Implementation of Order No. 841 might lead to greater deployment of energy storage which could improve balancing. Various grant programs administered by the Department of Energy (DOE) have supported the development of new technologies that can balance wind and solar sources or support reliability in other ways. These include research and development into electricity generators; wind forecast models and methodology; power electronics for solar sources; and standards for interconnection into the bulk power system. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) has funded research meant to improve short-term weather forecasting specifically related to wind power forecasts in two Wind Forecast Improvement Projects. DOE reports that advances made during this research include improved observations of meteorological data and improved methodologies for using those data in wind forecasts. \nPotential Issues for Congress\nCongress has held hearings related to the changes in the electricity generation profile of the country, and some Members raised concerns about reliability during these hearings. Members may continue to examine reliability issues moving forward, in light of projections that wind and solar will become an increasingly larger share of electricity generation. For example, EIA's projection of existing law and regulations shows wind and solar sources contributing 23% of electricity generation in 2050. Members may also choose to include reliability as part of any debate about policies to increase the generation from wind and solar sources. \nPreparing for higher levels of generation from wind and solar might require new approaches to maintaining electric reliability. The existing regulatory framework can accommodate some changes since FERC and NERC have authority to initiate development of new reliability standards. For example, NERC has raised the issue of whether it should develop new reliability metrics in light of the increasing use of VRE for electricity generation.\nIn addition to its capacity supply assessment, NERC's Reliability Assessment Subcommittee should lead the electric industry in developing a common approach and identify metrics to assess energy adequacy. As identified in this assessment, the changing resource mix can alter the energy and availability characteristics of the generation fleet. Additional analysis is needed to determine energy sufficiency, particularly during off-peak periods and where energy-limited resources are most prominent. \nCongress could choose to provide guidance for FERC and NERC activities in this area. \nCongress could also assess whether the existing regulatory framework is sufficient to maintain reliability if generation from wind and solar sources increase above current projections. One area of discussion is the siting and approval of transmission projects, particularly those that might result in enhanced availability of wind and solar sources for system balancing. Currently, the siting of electricity transmission facilities is largely left to the states. Section 1221 of EPACT05 directs FERC to issue permits for the construction or modification of transmission facilities in certain circumstances in areas designated by the Secretary of Energy as \"National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors.\" This authority was to be exercised only if the relevant state agency lacks the authority to permit the transmission facilities or has \"withheld approval for more than one year.\" Shortly after passage of EPACT05, DOE set out to designate the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors and FERC set up a framework for permitting transmission facilities on those corridors. However, federal courts vacated both agencies' actions, and neither agency has taken any significant action pursuant to their Section 1221 authority since that time.\nAs noted above, most power outages occur on local electricity distribution systems, and these are regulated by state or local governments. Congress could consider expanding federal activities affecting distribution system reliability. This might involve studies of the factors (e.g., weather, aging infrastructure, VRE) that result in power outages. Such activities might also include federal financial support for projects or practices that improve reliability of distribution systems or encouraging new operational regimes such as independent distribution system operators (see earlier discussion of this issue in text box, \"Distribution System Reliability\"). \nCongress might also consider acting on the emerging and related issue of electric resilience. Some support for an enhanced federal role in electricity system resilience exists. For example, the National Academy recommends \nCongress and the Department of Energy leadership should sustain and expand the substantive areas of research, development, and demonstration that are now being undertaken by the Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability and Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, with respect to grid modernization and systems integration, with the explicit intention of improving the resilience of the U.S. power grid.\nMany sources currently used to balance wind and solar have received federal financial support in the past, such as tax credits, grants to states or other entities, and DOE research programs. Congress might consider continuing or expanding this type of support if current activities affecting reliability were deemed insufficient.\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1. Provide a summarized version that captures all critical points and essential information from the report.\n2. Ensure the summary is logically coherent and maintains the original meaning and intent of the report.\n3. Use clear and precise language, avoiding any jargon or overly complex terms that may not be universally understood.\n4. Highlight key statistics, recommendations, and conclusions presented in the report.\n5. Provide a long summary that encapsulates all vital information. ", "response": "\n\nThis report explores how the increasing use of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as wind and solar, is impacting the reliability of the U.S. electric grid. While VRE sources offer clean energy benefits, their intermittent nature poses challenges for maintaining a reliable supply of electricity.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. electric grid is designed for traditional power plants that operate continuously. Balancing the grid requires adjustments in electricity generation to constantly match supply with demand. VRE sources, however, generate electricity only when the wind blows or the sun shines, making it harder to predict and control their output.\n\nTo address these challenges, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) develops and enforces reliability standards for the bulk power system, which comprises large-scale generators and transmission lines. NERC's assessments indicate that the grid is currently reliable, even with growing VRE penetration. However, questions remain about how the grid will perform with significantly higher levels of VRE in the future.\n\nThe report highlights several key considerations:\n\n* **Balancing VRE:** Balancing the grid with VRE requires flexible and responsive power sources. Traditionally, natural gas-fired power plants have been used for this purpose, but other options include energy storage, demand response programs, and even using geographically dispersed VRE sources to balance each other.\n\n* **Transmission Infrastructure:** Expanding transmission capacity is crucial to connect VRE sources to areas where electricity demand is highest. This involves overcoming regulatory and siting challenges associated with building new transmission lines.\n\n* **Federal Role:** The federal government plays a role in promoting grid reliability through regulations, incentives, and research funding. The report suggests that Congress may need to consider further actions, such as expanding federal authority over transmission siting or providing financial support for grid modernization and resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, while the U.S. grid is currently reliable despite the growth of VRE, careful planning and investments are necessary to ensure its continued reliability as VRE penetration increases. Balancing VRE, expanding transmission capacity, and clarifying the federal role in grid reliability are key considerations for policymakers.\n"}

So what's {disfmarker} what are your ideas about that ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Maybe I can have the {disfmarker} your opinion from the marketing side ?\nUser Interface: Well uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us .\nProject Manager: Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Do you agree ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices . And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part .

Might be a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend {disfmarker} the trend in domain , what it shouldn't {disfmarker} it should look like , or things like that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: With rou okay . Like for {disfmarker} okay .\nUser Interface: Something like that , least fits in your hand .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: The basic requirement .\nProject Manager: So .

Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: That might be good uh track to follow .\nUser Interface: Like as an optional thing .\nProject Manager: Optional or selled with it ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .\nProject Manager: Maybe we can have uh {disfmarker} But we don't design the T_V_ .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Barks .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , barks , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Barks .\nProject Manager: So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah whistle .\nProject Manager: I don't know , whistle-able ? {vocalsound} Th\nIndustrial Designer: Whistle tracking . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we {disfmarker} you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah d d uh .\nUser Interface: So i it's just going to add t to the cost .\nProject Manager: Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to {vocalsound} have an advantage over our competitors . I think this is a good advantage .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It's cool . I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .

{"id": "summarization_003", "instruction": "You're a professional researcher. Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nthe nature of the dark matter in the universe is one of the outstanding questions in astro / particle physics .\none of the favored candidates is the lightest supersymmetric ( susy ) particle .\nsuch a particle is weakly interacting and massive ( with mass in the range 1 gev \nfew tev ) , and hence is frequently characterized as a wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the lightest susy particle in most cases is the lightest neutralino , a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the photon , @xmath3 boson , and neutral - higgs bosons , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the supersymmetric partners of the u(1 ) gauge field @xmath7 and of the third component of the su(2 ) gauge field @xmath8 that mix to make the photon and @xmath3 boson .\n( we will also use the letter @xmath9 for @xmath10 . )\nmuch work has been done studying the possibilities for detecting these particles .\npossibilities include direct detection @xcite , whereby the particle interacts with a nucleon in a low temperature detector , and is identified by the kev of energy it deposits in the nucleon ; and indirect detection , whereby ( 1 ) the particles are captured in the sun or earth , sink to the center of the sun or earth , annihilate with one another in the core , and give rise to particles including neutrinos which can be detected by experiments on the surface of the earth @xcite , or ( 2 ) the particles annihilate in the galactic halo and produced anomalous components in the flux of cosmic rays @xcite .\nthe interaction processes of the lightest susy particle are clearly of great importance in calculations of predicted rates for both direct and indirect detection .    in this paper\nwe discuss the effect of cp violation on the neutralino annihilation and scattering cross sections .\nthe mssm introduces several new phases in the theory which are absent in the standard model .\nsupplemented by a universality condition at the grand unification scale , only two of these are independent . in this case , one may choose to work in a basis in which the two non - trivial cp - violating phases reside in @xmath11 and the universal soft trilinear coupling @xmath2 of the higgs fields to the scalar fermions @xmath12 .\npreviously falk , ferstl and olive @xcite have considered the effect on neutralino cross sections of a nonzero phase of @xmath11 , the mixing mass parameter involving the two higgs chiral superfields in the superpotential . here , on the other hand , we consider the effect on neutralino cross sections of the case where the soft trilinear scalar couplings @xmath13 are all complex numbers , where subscript @xmath14 refers to the quarks . to be specific , we will take @xmath15 with arbitrary @xmath16 , and we take @xmath17 . in part of susy parameter space\nwe find enhancement of these cross sections , and hence an increase in direct and indirect detection rates ; while in other parts of parameter space the cross sections are suppressed .\nthe phase of @xmath2 enters into the neutralino cross sections in two places : 1 ) into the squark masses , and 2 ) into the higgs sector .\nfor example , one of the processes that contributes to neutralino annihilation is s - channel exchange of the three neutral higgs bosons , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath2 , into final state fermions .\n( see fig .  1 ) .\nthe first two of these neutral higgs bosons , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are cp even , while @xmath2 is cp odd .\nthe new aspect considered here is the possibility of mixing between the cp - even higgs scalars ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and the cp - odd scalar @xmath2 .\nthis mixing was first studied by pilaftsis @xcite , who found that the size of cp violation can be fairly large , i.e.  of order one , for a range of kinematic parameters preferred by susy .\nhe found that a large @xmath20 mixing can naturally occur within two - higgs doublet models either at the tree level , if one adds softly cp - violating breaking terms to the higgs potential , or at one loop , after integrating out heavy degrees of freedom that break the cp invariance of the higgs sector , such as heavy majorana neutrinos . in any case , in this paper , we consider the one - loop effects of @xmath21 on scattering and annihilation cross sections relevant to direct and indirect detection .    in section\nii we discuss our general approach . in section iii , we discuss the squark sector , and in section iv , the higgs sector . in section\nv , we discuss experimental constraints on the parameters .\nwe present our results in section vi .\nthe minimal supersymmetric standard model provides a well -

channel exchange of the @xmath148 higgs boson ( fig .\n1(a ) ) , which occurs when @xmath149 ( see the lowest panel ) .\nnotice that in the cp conserving case , the s - channel exchange of the cp - even @xmath148 boson vanishes at @xmath35 because for real @xmath150 couplings the amplitude is proportional to @xmath151 which is zero at @xmath35 . in presence of cp violation ,\nthe @xmath150 couplings are in general complex , and the amplitude contains a contribution from @xmath152 which does not vanish at @xmath35 .\nso the @xmath148 resonant annihilation seen in fig .\n9 is only possible when cp is violated .\nfigure 10 shows a case which is experimentally allowed for all values of the phase @xmath153 . the maximum of the scattering cross section takes place at the cp - conserving value @xmath154 and the minimum at @xmath155 .\nthe annihilation cross section on the other hand is enhanced by cp violation , as can be seen in the second panel .\nnotice that its maximum occurs at @xmath156 , which is not the point of maximal cp violation @xmath157 .\nfinally fig .\n11 displays an example in which both cp conserving cases are experimentally excluded while some cp violating cases are allowed .\nthis is one of the red ( dark ) points in fig .\nthe @xmath155 case is ruled out by the bounds on both @xmath158 and the higgs mass , the @xmath154 case by only the bound on the higgs mass .\nnotice that the scattering cross section is of the order of @xmath159 pb , in the region probed by the direct detection experiments .\nthe annihilation cross section peaks at @xmath160 ; notice that again this value is not the point of maximal cp violation @xmath157 .\nwe have examined the effect of cp violation on the neutralino annihilation and scattering cross sections , which are of importance in calculations of the neutralino relic density and of the predicted rates for direct and indirect searches of neutralino dark matter .\nspecifically we have considered the case in which the only cp violating phase in addition to the standard model ckm phase is in the complex soft trilinear scalar couplings @xmath2 of the third generation .\nthis phase affects the squark masses and through radiative corrections generates a mixing between cp - even and cp - odd higgs bosons .\nthis mixing modifies the neutralino annihilation and scattering cross sections in the kinematic regimes relevant for dark matter detection .\nexploring @xmath161 points in supersymmetric parameter space with a non - zero phase of @xmath2 , we have found that : ( 1 ) the scattering cross section is generally suppressed , even by 7 orders of magnitude in special cases ; ( 2 ) the annihilation cross section can be enhanced by factors of @xmath0 as resonant neutralino annihilation through a higgs boson becomes possible at cp - violating values of the phase of @xmath2 .\nwe have also found cases which are experimentally excluded when cp conservation is imposed but are allowed when cp conservation is violated .\nsome of these cases have neutralino masses and cross sections in the region probed by current dark matter searches .\nwe would like to thank the department of energy for support through the physics department at the university of michigan , and the max planck institut fr physik for support during the course of this work .\nwe thank apostolos pilaftsis , tobias hurth , and antonio grassi for helpful discussions .\nsubsequent to the completion of this work we became aware of partially overlapping work by falk , ferstl , and olive ( hep -

", "response": "\nThis paper investigates the effect of CP-violation, specifically within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), on neutralino dark matter detection prospects. The authors focus on the impact of a non-zero phase in the complex soft trilinear scalar couplings of the third generation, denoted as A_t, which introduces CP- Violation beyond the Standard Model's CKM phase.\n\nThe study employs the DarkSUSY code, modified to incorporate the effects of this additional CP-violating phase.  A vast parameter space of the MSSM is explored, with 132,888 points representing different possible neutralino configurations.\n\nFor each point, the authors systematically varied the phase of A_t through 50 values, checking for consistency with various experimental constraints, including limits on the invisible Z width, Higgs boson masses, branching ratios, and electric dipole moments.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n\n* **Suppression of scattering cross sections:**  \nCP violation significantly suppresses the spin-independent neutralino-proton scattering cross section in most cases, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.\n\n* **Enhanced annihilation cross sections:**\n\nCP violation can enhance the neutralino annihilation cross section, allowing for resonant annihilation through a Higgs boson at specific phases of A_t. This enhancement can be as large as a factor of 100.\n\n* **Allowed CP-violating scenarios:**\nThe study identifies cases where CP-conserving scenarios are experimentally excluded, but CP-violating scenarios are allowed. These allowed points often have neutralino masses and interaction strengths within the reach of current dark matter detection experiments.\n\nIn essence, the paper demonstrates the importance of considering CP violation in supersymmetry when predicting dark matter detection signals.  CP-violation can significantly alter neutralino interaction strengths, leading to both suppression and enhancement of detectable signals depending on the specific scenario.\n\n\n\n"}

Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're {vocalsound} we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets .

{"id": "summarization_006", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nAcknowledging that survivors of sexual violence often behave differently than victims of other crimes, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin released an expansive report Monday that the UT System will use to train hundreds of officers who handle campus sexual assaults. \n \n The Blueprint for Campus Police, drafted by UT Austin’s Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, will be incorporated into training for almost 600 officers across all eight of the system’s academic institutions. \n \n “Police in America, historically, have responded to the investigation of crimes in kind of a generalized fashion, regardless of whether it’s a homicide, robbery, theft,” or assault, according to Mike Heidingsfield, the UT System director of police. Because assault victims have experienced trauma, their cases often call for a more specialized officer response he said. \n \n The training is especially necessary because of the prevalence of sexual assault, according to Noël Busch-Armendariz, the report’s principal investigator. One study, released in September, found that more than 18 percent of female undergraduates at UT Austin had been sexually assaulted since arriving on campus. \n \n The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. \n \n The report offers specific guidelines for officers from the moment they first interact with victims. “Let the victim know that they are safe,” the report reads. “Let the victim know they will not be judged,” and “understand that a victim’s alcohol or drug use is an issue of increased ‘vulnerability rather than culpability.’” \n \n The specificity of the report allows officers to approach abstract concepts, like empathy, in immediate, real-world ways, according to Busch-Armendariz. “We wanted to make the blueprint a product that was meaningful and useful,” she said. \n \n Some signs that might indicate an individual is lying about being the victim of a crime — if their story changes between retellings, or if they can’t remember key details, for example — must be reinterpreted in the context of assault, she added. \n \n “Trauma victims often omit, exaggerate, or make up information when trying to make sense of what happened to them or to fill gaps in memory,” the report reads. “This does not mean the sexual assault did not occur.” \n \n The eight academic institutions in the UT System have unique cultures — and unique prevailing beliefs about assault — but some misunderstandings about rape are widespread nationally, Heidingsfield said. Two years ago, the U.S. Department of Education launched a federal investigation into UT Pan American (which has since been merged into UT Rio Grande Valley) and 54 other colleges over their handling of sexual abuse complaints. \n \n The report acts as sort of a primer about the reality and impact of sexual assault, addressing a number of “common rape myths” as well as concepts such as victim blaming. \n \n The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. \n \n “If a girl is raped while drunk, she is at least somewhat responsible for letting things get out of control,” reads the first entry on the myth list. Other items include “if a guy is drunk, he might rape someone unintentionally” and “a lot of times, girls who say they were raped agreed to have sex and then regret it.” \n \n After adapting their perceptions based on the reality of assault, police officers are encouraged to adopt policies that are “victim-centered, science-based, and trauma-informed,” Heidingsfield said. \n \n Another dominant theme of the report is victim behavior after an incident of assault. Although officers might expect survivors to be hysterical or crying, they are often “in shock and passive, quiet, and unemotional,” the report reads. \n \n “The crown jewel to this research effort for us is that we now have the science to understand neurobiology, and victimology, to apply that to how victims present themselves to police officers,” Heidingsfield said. This “allows us to push tradition to the side and now understand why victims say what they do.” \n \n Although the report outlines best practices for dealing with survivors of sexual assault, researchers did not actually interview survivors in the process of conducting their study. Instead, they relied on 27 interviews with campus presidents and police officers, among others. \n \n The report’s authors did employ previously collected data from survivors in other institute studies, Busch-Armendariz said. \n \n “The retelling of incidents wasn’t really necessary for the data they’re collecting, and they had the information they needed,” said Jenny LaCoste-Caputo, a UT System spokeswoman. The researchers did not want to “reopen real emotional wounds,” she added. \n \n Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.

The alleged victim herself never filed an official complaint with campus or city police officers, according to the lawsuit. \n \n But the University of Texas at Austin has recommended that the 21-year-old male student, who is one semester away from earning a degree in physics, be expelled for violating the institutional rules of the college, the suit states. \n \n The attorney for the male student has asked a judge to stop UT-Austin from holding a planned disciplinary hearing at which Title IX investigators for the school have recommended his expulsion. \n \n Court documents state the male student has not been afforded his Constitutional due process rights and that the allegations in question do not constitute sexual assault, among other protestations lodged by the plaintiff’s attorney. \n \n Drunken sex? \n \n On the night of the alleged assault on March 6, 2015, the plaintiff, John Doe, met two girls, Jennifer Smith and non UT-Austin student Jane Roe (names changed to protect privacy) at a house party near campus. \n \n After several hours of excessive drinking and flirting, the plaintiff went to Roe’s apartment along with Smith. Roe was drunk and largely incoherent, and Smith allegedly told Doe at that point that if he had sex with Roe it would be rape, court documents state, adding Doe asked to crash on the couch and Smith and Roe went to sleep in the bedroom. \n \n However, not long after, Smith came out from the bedroom and asked Doe to have sex with her, a version of events both agree upon, court documents state. They had sex on the bed as Roe was asleep next to them. \n \n The following morning was just as eventful. \n \n According to the lawsuit, “Ms. Roe, who had fallen to the floor during the night, woke up and got back into bed” – the bed where Smith and Doe were asleep. Roe and Doe then began to touch each other in suggestive manners. Smith left the bed during the foreplay to give the two privacy, the lawsuit states. \n \n “While collecting her things, Ms. Smith heard Ms. Roe talking, saw her responding to the plaintiff’s touching, and believed that Ms. Roe intended to have consensual sex with the plaintiff as she was about to leave,” the suit states. \n \n “At no time during sex was Ms. Roe unconscious,” it added. “She was an active sexual participant at all times during the intercourse that took place that morning.” \n \n Later that day, however, Roe texted Smith that she was unconscious during the sex and was upset her friend had left her alone in her apartment with Doe: “I don’t remember throwing up, or coming home, or having this random fucking guy in my bed. … I didn’t want this guy. At all. This guy wanted me and got me when I wasn’t conscious.” \n \n In reply to Roe’s text, Smith said: “Dude I didn’t realize you were unconscious, you were talking to me…” \n \n In the weeks after the incident, Doe and Roe texted each other. At first, Roe indicated she was upset with Doe and said she thought the sex was nonconsensual because she was unconscious. However, through chatting on Facebook and texting, Roe became satisfied “that both the plaintiff and Ms. Smith believed Ms. Roe was awake and sober during the sex that took place, despite her own lack of memory,” the suit states. \n \n “Ms. Roe would acknowledge that she believed the sex between her and the plaintiff ‘sounded passionate’ and she was surprised that she had confided in him that she had appeared in pornographic films,” the suit states. \n \n In texts, Doe and Roe talked about meeting up, but never did meet face to face again. \n \n RELATED: Students taught determining factor between sex and sexual assault is consent \n \n Investigation launched \n \n About a month later, on April 8, 2015, Roe’s father called the University of Texas Police Department claiming his daughter had been sexually violated by the plaintiff. However, the department contains no record of Roe reporting any assault and no charges were pursued against the plaintiff, the suit states. \n \n But the father’s call to police was referred to UT Austin’s Dean of Students office, which commenced a Title IX investigation into the events, despite Roe not being an actual student at the University of Texas. \n \n On May 18, 2015, during the campus investigation, Doe told campus Title IX officials he believed he had consent from Roe because “she was talking dirty, she was enjoying it,” court documents state. \n \n “We had sex and then she fell asleep and then woke up and had sex again,” Doe had added. “That’s when she told me she had a girlfriend and that she had done a porn movie a few months prior. I feel like as evidence she is telling me all this personal stuff about her, it’s not just me raping this drunk girl.” \n \n “I don’t remember her puking at all,” Doe also told investigators of Roe. “There was a time when she passed out and I had written her off then. After she passed out, (Ms. Smith) let me chill on the couch so I didn’t have to walk home. Nothing after that would have happened if (Ms. Smith) hadn’t invited me back into the bedroom.” \n \n But the campus Title IX investigators, also named as defendants in the suit, found that the plaintiff “had sexually assaulted another student …” court documents state. \n \n RELATED: Student expelled for ‘gray rape’ accusation settles lawsuit against university \n \n Due process in question \n \n In November 2015, Doe received word that his expulsion had been recommended for violating the institutional rules of the college, but that he would be granted a hearing to contest the recommendation. \n \n The lawsuit argues that there was gender bias by investigators against the plaintiff in violation of Title IX, and that the hearing Doe has been afforded has such strict rules on presenting evidence that it hampers his due process rights under state law. For example, he cannot cross examine Roe. He cannot subpoena witnesses. \n \n “Students have a protected liberty interest in public higher education, and therefore cannot be deprived of that protected liberty interest without due course [due process] of law,” it adds. \n \n Due course of law in the state is provided by the Texas Constitution. It directly states: “No citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner disfranchised, except by the due course of law of the land.” \n \n What’s more, according to the lawsuit, the university’s “definition and application of the term ‘consent’ in the context of sexual assault disciplinary actions is so broad that the University may expel a student without proving that there were any objective indicators of non-consent from the alleged victim.” \n \n The plaintiff’s attorney is Brian Roark, an Austin-based lawyer known for successfully defending former Texas Longhorn football player Kendall Sanders, who was found not guilty of sexual assault last October. Sanders had been kicked off the team after his arrest in July 2014 and faced two to 20 years in prison if convicted. \n \n Roark did not respond to a request for comment from The College Fix on when the judge is expected to rule on the request to halt the expulsion proceedings against Doe. \n \n RELATED: Rape accusers sue University of Tennessee for giving accused students due process \n \n Like The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter \n \n IMAGE: Shutterstock ||||| A physics major one semester away from graduation is suing to stop University of Texas-Austin from expelling him based on the unproven accusation he sexually assaulted a woman in a drunken, off-campus encounter. \n \n In one of the latest cases of male college students turning to the courts after being punished by public universities for being accused of sexual assaults, the 21-year-old man identified as John Doe in legal papers claims the school is violating his Constitutional right to due process. His alleged victim, who did not attend the school, never filed a police report, according to his lawyer, yet the school took action based on her father’s complaint. \n \n “What we’re seeing here is a nationwide movement that has gone too far in what the system sees as victims of campus assaults,” said Brian Roark. \"Give us a fair hearing, and we'll deal with the consequences.\" \n \n “My law office gets phone calls every day from students who want to defend their right to due process.” - Andrew Miltenberg \n \n Doe, who claims the sex was consensual, is facing a disciplinary hearing that could result in his expulsion, The College Fix reported. He filed the suit about two months ago with the goal of clearing his name. \n \n The alleged incident occurred on March 6, 2015, after a night of heavy drinking at a house party where Doe met two unnamed women, according to the lawsuit. The three spent the night at an off-campus apartment belonging to one of the women, where Doe had sex with one woman that night and the other the next morning, according to the lawsuit. \n \n The father of the woman who had sex with Doe the next morning told campus police of the encounter a month later, prompting a school investigation. Doe told investigators that the woman was enthusiastic about the encounter and talked about being in a pornographic movie. \n \n “It’s not just me raping this drunk girl,” Doe told investigators, according to the lawsuit. \n \n But the alleged victim later told her friend, who had had sex with Doe hours earlier, that she was still intoxicated from the previous night and was in fact unconscious during sex. \n \n “I don’t remember throwing up, or coming home, or having this random … guy in my bed,” the alleged victim texted her friend, according to the lawsuit. “I didn’t want this guy. At all. This guy wanted me and got me when I wasn’t conscious.” \n \n Her friend reportedly responded, “Dude I didn’t realize you were unconscious, you were talking to me,” according to the lawsuit. \n \n Differing accounts of drunken sexual encounters are at the core of most similar cases being dealt with by colleges and universities in the wake of a 2011 directive from the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. In that letter, the federal government threatened to withhold funding under the gender equity law known as Title IX if schools did not demonstrate they were taking serious action to halt the epidemic of sexual assaults on campus. \n \n While proponents say the federal efforts have protected women on campus, critics say it sparked a rush to judgment against young men who can have their lives ruined by unproven accusations. \n \n \"The university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault and as a result have adopted a practice of expelling males from the university without regard to the rights of the accused student of the evidence,” the lawsuit states. \n \n Roark said UT-Austin's policy barred Doe from having legal representation, cross-examining the accuser or even calling on testimony from corroborating witnesses, including the other woman. He scoffed at the “27-year-old education grads” he said typically staff the school-run probes. \n \n UT-Austin declined to comment, citing a policy of not discussing ongoing litigation or student discipline. \n \n Dozens of young men are going to court to seek relief from punishment and reputational damage meted out by schools for alleged sexual assaults, according to Inside Higher Ed. As of November, there are more than 50 pending lawsuits filed by men who claim they were unfairly expelled from college after being accused of sexual assault. \n \n “I think you can have a system that encourages victims to come forward while protecting the rights of the accused,” Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who specializes in campus assault due process, told FoxNews.com. “But are we there yet? No.” \n \n Miltenberg gained national attention when he represented a Columbia University student accused of raping a fellow student who went on to conduct a campaign against the man by carrying a mattress around campus and making a video re-enactment of her alleged rape. \n \n Paul Nungesser was cleared of rape charges, but is now suing the school in federal court for failing to stop Emma Sulkowicz from harassing him. Sulkowicz, with the help of three friends, carried the mattress when she received her diploma during graduation to the cheers of fellow students. \n \n Nungesser’s mother, who was at the graduation ceremony, told Newsweek, “I would have liked to go to every single parent in that audience and say, ‘I am the mother of Paul, and I am very proud of my son, and I hope you discuss with your sons and daughters what they did to him.” \n \n In one of the first of its kind, the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island on Monday ruled to allow a former student’s lawsuit to proceed against Brown University, alleging that the school violated his due process and discriminated against him based on gender during a wrongful sexual misconduct investigation. \n \n “My law office gets phone calls every day from students who want to defend their right to due process,” Miltenberg said. “The courts are going to have to see enough of these that there is a sense across the country that, Wait, this is coming up too much, there really must be something wrong.” \n \n Edmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com.

Provide a long summary to contain all the needed information.", "response": "\n\nThis article discusses two separate but related events concerning sexual assault accusations and due process in university settings.\n\nThe first part of the article focuses on a new training program developed by the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) for campus police officers on handling sexual assault cases. This program, called \"Blueprint for Campus Police,\" acknowledges that victims of sexual assault often behave differently than victims of other crimes and requires officers to approach these cases with specialized knowledge and empathy. \n\nThe training emphasizes the trauma experienced by victims, explaining that they may omit, exaggerate, or fabricate details when recounting events due to memory gaps or coping mechanisms. It warns against misinterpreting these behaviors as indicators of lying.\n\nThe \"Blueprint\" was developed based on research conducted by UT Austin's Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. The research found that 18% of female undergraduates at UT Austin had experienced sexual assault since arriving on campus. The report also addresses common rape myths and promotes a victim-centered approach to investigations.\n\nThe second part of the article centers on a lawsuit filed by a male student, identified as John Doe, against UT Austin. Doe, a physics major nearing graduation, faces expulsion after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman who was not a UT student.\n\nThe alleged victim's father contacted campus police, triggering a Title IX investigation despite the woman not filing a formal complaint. Doe maintains the sex was consensual, but the alleged victim later texted a friend claiming she was unconscious during the encounter. \n\nDoe's lawsuit argues that the university violated his due process rights by denying him legal representation, the ability to cross-examine the accuser, and the right to subpoena witnesses. His lawyer, Brian Roark, criticizes the university's investigative process, claiming it lacks procedural safeguards to protect the accused.\n\nThis case exemplifies a larger trend of male students suing universities for perceived unfair treatment in sexual assault cases, claiming that the push for protecting victims has eroded due process for the accused.\n\nThe article cites several other lawsuits filed by men facing expulsion for alleged sexual assault and quotes experts who believe the system needs to balance the rights of victims and the accused.\n\nOne expert, Andrew Miltenberg, who specializes in campus assault due process cases, argues that while encouraging victims to come forward is crucial, it should not come at the expense of the accused's rights.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting the growing number of lawsuits challenging universities' handling of sexual assault allegations and suggesting that courts may need to intervene more frequently to ensure due process for all parties involved.\n"}

No need to become a model - just keep your general appearance clean, nice and attractive.\n\n\nHave good hygiene. Showering everyday, washing your hair as often as needed, and brushing your teeth regularly are basic rules. You could also go further and change your looks a little. A brand new haircut is always popular to make a fresh start. For girls, you could try another way to make up, or have your hands done at a beauty parlor. Be sure to enjoy the change, though, or else you'll regret it!\nAdopt healthy habits. Sleep as many hours a night as you need, enjoy the day's sunshine, exercise regularly, eat consistent and nutritious meals...You know the list. Not only will this make you look fitter (and thus more attractive); it will also give you a healthier constitution-which means more stamina, which is not something to overlook if you plan on going out, and being a dynamic person to date!\nTake a good look at your wardrobe. Do you like what you see? Are you tired of your regular clothes ? You could consider buying some items you don't possess (for instance if you're short of trendy evening clothes) or even changing your style a bit.. or, why not, a lot.\n\nAgain, don't feel forced to do that: you starting off a dating life does not necessarily mean you have to make a complete break in your life. Your clothes should make you happy and comfortable. Still, be sure you have some pieces of clothing that really suit your appearance and personality, and that will look good on special occasions. For instance, a classy shirt, becoming blue-jeans, colorful sweater, little black dress...Don't hesitate to ask a good friend for advice!\n\n;\n, Expectations vary with people. Before entering the dating scene, you have to determine what you're looking for there.\n\n\nDo you want a serious relationship, or just a casual one? Would you be okay with having a friend with benefits, or one night stands? In short, you should check what a \"great love life\" is in your opinion. It will help when you actually meet people. For instance, dating a casual person could be considered as a loss of time if you're looking for a committed relationship. If you're not, it could be a lot of fun!\n\n, Determine what your expectations are, but don't consider them as an absolute rule! Things that you want now can change after a few years.\n\n\nThe person you dismiss may have potential as a love interest. Keep open to new possibilities and new people. It does not mean you have to give anybody a chance just for the sake of giving it. However, someone who seems bland or shallow on the telephone/during the first encounter could loosen up during an extended conversation over coffee or drinks - and turn out to be just shy or caught at a bad time!\n\n, A popular belief is that to be happy as a lover you first have to be happy as a single person. It may not always be true- or sad people would never find love, but that's still a wise idea. What's the point of wasting your life until you find somebody to love-or even to date ? You'll just make yourself sadder. It is perfectly normal to feel blue if you're lonely. But don't let that stop you from having fun!\n\n\nHappy and content people are much more attractive to meet! Spend time with your friends, exercise, indulge in hobbies and passions...live it up! Take advantage of your independence, too. You'll never be more free than you are right now. Now is the time to go abroad, form a music band, write a novel, try new things, put some wildness in your life..Remember that an interested person is always an interesting one as well, and it's not just because you're single and looking you shouldn't have the time of your life!\n\n, Society can be hard on single people. If most of the people you know are in relationships, you may wonder if the problem's not with you. But don't. As long as you're decently clean, reasonably nice and not inapproachable, there's no reason you couldn't have a love life of your own.\n\n\nRemember that love and dating are mostly made of chance encounters, even on the dating websites. Get rid of all the self-deprecatory thinking and talking: once you put yourself down, others are likely to do so as well. Dismiss all negative comments on your single status, either from your acquaintances or from yourself.\n\nFor instance, if you're self-conscious about your appearance, keep in mind this is roughly everybody's case. Try to describe yourself objectively or ask a trustworthy friend to do so. You'll find out you have beautiful traits, just like everyone else.\n\n\nIf you still can't get over the idea that lovable people must be perfect and you're not, visualize the persons you know who are in a happy relationship right now, or the couples you see walking down the street. Are they all gorgeous looking, or incredibly brainy ? Chance is, they're as imperfect as you-and maybe more so !\n\n, If you've been single for awhile, you've probably already been told that by going out you will be more likely to meet new people than by staying home watching TV (which, of course, is true). Still, living by that rule can be a bit demoralizing in time, when you force yourself out of the house and come back alone and/or disinterested. So keep these two principles in mind:\n\n\nDon't go out every single day of the year if you don't feel like it! No need to exhaust yourself. Make compromises: go out a few times a week, or at least once a week and take advantage of the evenings 'off' to relax, go to sleep earlier, spend some quiet time with friends or relatives...You will be in much better shape on the times you do go out...and you'll feel much more happy and impatient to do so!\nDon't go out just for the sake of meeting someone. That's the easiest way to be dissuaded to go on. Of course, your chance of clicking with somebody will always be at the back of your head-and it should be, but don't make it a priority! Only go out because you enjoy it. Go to see movies or exhibitions you're interested in, attend lectures at libraries/museums/local universities, have a drink at your favorite bar, go dancing...the list is endless. However, be sure that should you not meet a potential mate, you'll still enjoy the time out! Who knows what may happen...\n\n, Then, you can actually stay in and meet people!\n\n\nOnce in a while through the year, throw a small party at your place. It doesn't have to be for a special occasion. It may not even be very expensive, if you ask each of your guests to bring something for the buffet.\nOf course, you may invite your closest friends but in order to get acquainted with new ones, don't hesitate to ask persons you don't know so well to come along-like a new colleague, or a neighbour. If you don't know many people, ask your friends to bring friends of their own and take advantage of the party to get to know them too!\n\n, The next time your colleagues/schoolmates propose a going-out, or a person you like but are not crazy about asks you out for a drink, take a deep breath before refusing to come along. Do you really have something more important to do? If the answer is no, just go for it. True, you may not appreciate it. And you may have a great time!\n\n\nAnyway, keep in mind accepting invitations is a great way to remain in that 'going out' mood. It's easier than planning something on your own, and it's more motivating as you will be surrounded by people you already know. Besides, it will establish you as a social, dynamic person and you'll be very likely to get asked out again!\n\n, Some people claim that flirting in real life is outdated. Others that you hardly ever meet the right person on dating websites. Then, there are those who say dating in the office/class is a definite 'no'-because of gossips and everyone knowing. What about the ones who tried the gym/theatre club and declared it a dead area? You may then begin to wonder where people actually meet.\n\n\nThe thing is there are no right or wrong places to meet someone- there only are right and wrong persons for you. If you click with somebody, no matter if you are in the subway, a concert intermission, a coffee shop's queue, a public library with a sign 'silent please', or a dating website! On the other hand, you could go to that fantastic bar in which your best friend has met his/her current lover and come home without a telephone number. So, keep your eyes and mind opened!\n\n, Everybody has a social network-friends, relatives, colleagues, old school mates, neighbours...Of course, some are broader. If you moved to a new town, and have no acquaintances there, it can take a little time to establish connections! The good thing about a network though is it's like a cobweb: it keeps spreading!\n\n\nDon't hesitate to take advantage of your connections in order to meet new people. You can frankly announce to your friends you're looking for someone-they may have a great cousin to introduce you to. Otherwise, use your social gatherings to broaden your circle of acquaintances- family events, college/high school reunions, cocktail parties could be good occasions for that!\n\n, If you have had your life organized around settled people-family, married friends, children... it can be tempting and comfortable to live at their pace and neglect your dating life. Of course, friends are precious and you should not give up on the cozy and warm times you spend together. However, remember to keep time and space for your love life. Schedule some nights out for you during the week and keep to them.\n\n\nIf you have children, try to have them babysit once in a while and enjoy the free time! If most of your friends are in relationships, try to befriend other bachelors-you can share experiences, advices and feelings.\n\n, Now that you're an active dating person, you should not overlook the risks the game implies! Be sure to adopt the right habits from the start.\n\n\nExchanging phone numbers is one of dating most basic customs . If you meet someone and you both click, what's wrong about giving your number? Still, when it's a person you really don't know, or if you're unsure whether you actually want to see him/her again, you may find safer to accept the person's number and not give yours.\n\nSay you'll call them later or send them a message and take some time to think it over. If you're bothered by someone who has your phone number and just won't leave you alone, take a look at your phone options: there is often a way to reject unwanted calls. If there isn't and the person's attitude creeps you out, you may consider changing your phone number!\n\n\nIf you decide to meet someone you've come across on a website dating, be sure it doesn't happen in a secluded place. Opt for a public square or a lively coffee shop, for instance. You may also want to phone the person some time before the encounter, if you've only communicated through e-mails and such. Hearing his/her voice will prepare you gradually for a meeting in real life!\nPreservatives are another area you should be concerned about. Protecting yourself from STD and/or unwanted pregnancy is an essential path to a happy, safe and relaxed sex life. If you have interrogations about the different ways to protect yourself, consult specialized websites. Even if you're not sexually active right now, be sure to have condoms at home. You may also take some just in case on dates that could end in a bed. One is never too careful!\n\n, OK, now you're out and you know the score, so what happens? Now you have to get familiar with the oldest dating habit: communication. Indeed, should you be surrounded by twenty eligible bachelors every day of the week, if you don't attempt to make conversation with any of them, your dating life will just stand still.\n\n\nGet rid of your shyness and apprehensions and start talking. It's not as difficult as it seems and will go easier and easier over time. Introduce yourself. Ask questions. Enquire about the person's activities, hobbies...and so on. Parties are the perfect place to communicate with strangers as you both know the host and can talk about how you came to know him/her as well as your own paths in life.\nIf flirting makes you uneasy, persuade yourself you're not looking for a love interest, but simply, a new acquaintance- then see where it leads you to! Otherwise, if you feel attracted by the person, let it show!\n\nUse some simple, friendly signals: smile, make eye contact, laugh at his/her jokes (but do it genuinely), express your interest...Then, when you get to know the person better, you may employ physical contact: kiss him/her on the cheek when you part, or gently shake hands, pat him/her on the arm or the shoulder to make a point...Don't be too invading though: some people are touchy, specially with strangers! Verbal flirting will come naturally to you if you're attracted, and specially if you feel the feeling is mutual! Just keep this attraction in the back of your head: it will come out, in subtle touches, in the course of your conversation. Again, don't make too blunt statements if you're unsure of the person-or of yourself!\n\n\n\n, As you go through the dating process, it's likely you'll meet some people who just won't be right for you. You may feel hurt over someone's neglecting to call you back, be offended by a date's behaviour, or frustrated by a relationship that never seems to get started. Remember these are not the only dates you'll get: so do yourself a favor, and forget about them.\n\n\nErase their name from your notebook and phone contacts and keep them out of your mind. Of course, it's easier said than done. But it's also much simpler when you have places to go to, and new love interests to meet. Still, you can decide to give someone a second chance: you're the only judge of that. Evaluate their potential as well as your own interest-which may have changed over time.\n\n, A date often pops up unexpectedly. And suddenly, you're being asked where you would like to meet the following evening. To avoid having to answer \"I don't know\" or to choose the spot in a hurry, be ahead of your time, and start looking before the invitations come crawling at your door!\n\n\nTake a look at your town's opportunities and make a list of the best places. Where are the not-so-expensive but delightful little restaurants? And the romantic parks? And the atmospheric bars and cafés? Help yourself in your search with magazines, or tourist guides. Note all the means of transport, and figure out the kind of people who are likely to love these spots.\n\n, If you haven't done it in a while or are inexperienced, you may feel nervous and apprehensive about making love. It is quite natural. Still, keep in mind the more relaxed and spontaneous you are about sex, the more pleasure you'll get and give!\n\n\nStart by becoming comfortable about your own body. Enjoy the simple sensuality of a fresh breeze, the touch of warm water, the softness of your bed...and so on. Indulge in some self-love. If you feel the need, don't hesitate waiting before having sex: there's no rush. And remember a happy sex life means knowing your partner- so open up and communicate - and most of all, know yourself.\n\n, On the first weeks/months of your life on the dating scene, you may experience disappointment and feel that nothing's turning to concrete. But be patient ! Finding a mate/lover/date takes time. Don't give up on your social activities, and keep going out and meeting new people. Once you'll find someone you like, be sure there'll be another someone, and another one after that ! It's the spillover effect of socializing. The very start is not easy. But after you're done with it-enjoy yourself ! Not only will you possess a notebook full of new acquaintances, friends or love interests, you will also become more and more carefree, self-confident and happy about dating- and thus, more and more of an attractive person to date !\n\n, Mutual respect should be the foundation of each relationship you're starting, whether it is casual or more committed. Love and passion are beautiful things: but keep away from love devoid of respect. It is dangerous and can become creepy: or at least, pretty unnerving !\n\n\nStay on your guards if your love interest ever treats you with meanness, rudeness or despise. Refuse insulting terms, hurting laughs, or dismisses of your freedom- even if they're only occasional. When a date gets really bad, make up some excuse and go away. Never stay in a relationship that brings you more sadness than joy. You don't have to put up with any condescending or violent treatment. Ask your friends, family -or even the police !- for help, if needed. Still, keep in mind respect does not mean complete devotion or putting someone on a pedestal. Gentle laughs and good-humoured teasing are a show of familiarity, but not an offensive one. Quarrels and arguments happen in the most loving relationships. So don't go to the other extreme and become paranoid or exacting with your partner.\nOn the other hand, be sure to behave respectfully with your love interests. If you have no interest in seeing someone again, be distant but still polite. Remember to thank the person after a date invitation and ask for news from your social circle now and then. Don't get angry over little things, for instance somebody's showing off a little late. If you disagree with a person's point of view, express your own opinions in a calm and firm manner. Keep in mind laughing and joking are great ways to bond with someone but that mocking is not. Once you get to know a person better, be a considerate lover. Propose a lift, show interest, give a small present once in a while, cheer him/her up after a bad day, lend an attentive ear, give spontaneous hugs...and so on. Of course, don't overdo it ! Don't become excessively devoted or intrusive. You can respect and love a person and still say no to him/her once in a while.\n\n, Don't pay attention to the 'norms'. If you feel like going steady after two weeks of dating and so does your mate, who cares if magazines say it 'usually' takes several months ? On the other hand, if you should need more time to adapt to the idea of living with someone or go slow, just do it ! But be careful to let the communication line open, so your partner knows where you stand for and that you taking some time does not mean you don't care !\n\n, Now that you've found your mate and life's looking wonderful- just one last piece of advice ! Don't forget to keep some private space in your life. The idea is not to make your partner feel excluded or jealous, of course ! But because, as tempting as it seems, center your whole life exclusively around one person may become pretty suffocating in time, and for both of you.\n\n\nKeep in touch with your old friends, your old hobbies and allow yourself to discover new passions and interests ! You'll have plenty of things to tell your mate when you see each other and he/she may use the time off to connect with his/her own secret garden. Still, this doesn't mean you can't do things in common-quite the contrary ! But be sure to find a good balance, so being together remains a treat.\n\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_011", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nFORWARD: \n Everyone loved their time spent in Termina, even if it was difficult, creepy, or somewhat depressing. Honestly, the eerie tone of the whole game is what set it apart from others in the series. So, I have an idea for a new Zelda game, a sequel (of sort) to Majora's Mask. I spent some time brainstorming ideas and jotting them down in my notebook. I made sure to keep everything in line with the timeline and tried to draw in ideas from other games. If you think something could be changed please tell me. I may be just a fanboy with wishful thinking, but maybe someday some small aspect of this idea may be used in a Zelda game. That would mean the world to me. With that in mind, I would like to share with you my ideas for..... THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA'S WRATH \n SETTING: The game is set in Hyrule a few years or more after the events of Twilight Princess. Link is a knight of Hyrule and Zelda is the Queen. Link has returned the Master sword to its pedestal in the woods (probably for a future link to use) and Zelda has been repairing the kingdom from the twilight events. Majora's Wrath starts off with a windwaker-esque cutscene of a scroll detailing the twilight events and the repairing of the Kingdom, as well as explaining that Midna has reclaimed her throne and has exiled the twili, loyal to zant, to an ancient ritual chamber that is sealed in another land. Then it tells of a mysterious dark figure in hyrule that has stolen the shadow stone from link. \n FROM HYRULE TO TERMINA: \n It cuts to Link and Zelda on epona galloping across the desert chasing a dark figure riding a beast. The chase leads up the arbiter grounds and to the shattered mirror of Twilight. The hooded figure hops off the beast, which is a massive red and black wolf with evil red eyes. The wolf then shifts into a human form... dark link! The figure removes his hood to reveal the fabulous ghiraham. He says something sassy, holds up a piece of the mirror and the shadow stone, and creates a portal that sucks the four of them in. Very much in the style of the magic mirror in alttp. The four of them fall through the portal of pure white light and sand (think like inside an hourglass) until a black speck at the bottom of the portal becomes bigger and manifests itself as a big colorful clock. They fall on to the clockface and colorful explosions dot the night sky. \n BATTLE ON CLOCKTOWER: \n Big booms shake the screen as ominous music plays and the antagonists give a little monologue. Ghiraham snaps his fingers and dissappears to go meet with \"their ally\". Dark link smiles as he draws his blade. Link draws his knight sword to defend Zelda, but she nocks a silver arrow in her siiick gold bow. (For once, Zelda is a fully functional ally, with the capacity to defend herself, and the ones around her. She has her bow and sword) A fight ensues between the three and dark link is no match for the hylian heros. He turns into a wolf and dashes through link as he escapes. Link and Zelda climb down the clocktower and are greeted by the townspeople \n NOT IN HYRULE ANYMORE : \n A man with blue hair comes up and can't believe it, he seems to know link! Link denys knowing him. But he insists that link helped him marry his wife, a red haired woman. This character reveals that he is mayor kafei! he thinks link is MM link. He notes that maybe he just mistook link for someone else because that was 20 years ago. Kafei explains that shady characters have been seen around town and that they have caused mischief in clocktown and in the villages surrounding the area. the dark figures they just ran off had probably been in league with them. Kafei offers them a room at the stockpot inn and a warm bowl of soup. At the inn Zelda explains they are from a far off land and that the troublemakers used magic to bring them to clocktown. Anju says that maybe the magic could bring them back to Hyrule. \n A FAMILIAR HAPPY FACE : \n A man with a purple hood at the inn says that A boy a long time ago used magic and left Termina. But the magic that he used departed with him. However he left a magic item.. a key of a sort that can do all sorts of things, but it had the power to take them back. The key was divided up into 4 pieces and sent to the leaders of the, Deku, Goron, Zora, and the 4th piece was placed in a grave of the Hero. Link and Zelda know they must go get the key. The figure removes his hood and he is the happy mask salesman! He gives link the shadow stone back, stating that the dark figure dropped it. Kafei also tells him on the way out that a boy in green gave him this as a reminder to never forger him. Its a mask like a deku face. \n SOUTHERN SWAMP: \n Link and Zelda rest up and then head out to the southern swamp to get the key piece from the deku. On the way, they go through a hollow log and meet 2 fairies. They recognize link and join them on their adventure. Tael accompanys link and tatl goes with zelda. Link must turn into a wolf to help solve puzzles and get him and Zelda across the swamp and to the deku kingdom. The only way in the palace To see the deku leader is to be a deku. Tael tells link to put on the mask and try to get in the palace. When he puts it on he is transformed into a deku scrub!! He is allowed in and the Deku queen tells him of an evil monster that eats dekus and has been lurking in the deep swamp outside the kingdom. Deku kingdom is roughly the size of half of clocktown. \n DEEP SWAMP: \n Link and Zelda work together to track down the monster and navigate the swamp with the help of the deku queens first knight, the monkey from MM. As they track the beast in a swampy lair, it shoots out of the water to reveal itself.. i giant swamp snake! The battle unfolds and link is told to turn into a wolf to bite it! However, link puts on the deku mask and uses the shadow stone and becomes a flying squirrel mixed with a bulbasaur type wolf. He has the ability to glide in the air as well as hop across the water with grace and speed. The snake is killed by deku link flying over it and stunning its eye, 3 times, deku wolf link hoppong across the water to disarm its tail, and link stabs the head while zelda puts an arrow through it. Ghiraham appears and claps. He tells them that the beast was dumb and his most unimaginative creation. But he jumps off a tree limb and battles link sword to sword on the dead body of the snake. He loses to him and snaps his fingers to disappear. The deku queen gives them a key piece and tells them that word has spread that a dark figure headed toward the mountains. But she heard that the mischief makers will be dealt with when the queen from far away arrives. \n SNOWHEAD: \n So link and Zelda set off to snowhead with their fairies. Along the winding trail to the mountain valley the owl swoops in and drops link the goron mask and only says, \"Welcome back young friend\" (ironic because of his NOTORIOUSLY long monologues) link puts on the mask and can crush boulders with his goron fists and can also use the shadow crystal to turn into a bear-like rock wolf. This form is for tough fights and climbing. The heros traverse the springtime valley and go into the snowy village. The gorons in goron city are all scared to go out at night. (Goron city is much larger than in majora's mask) Link and Zelda go speak with the chief, who is the whiny baby from MM. He tells them a creature of the night has been attacking Gorons for weeks and everyone is scared. The heros set out to track the beast ( with the bearwolf form) and slay it. \n MOUNTAIN CAVES: \n Zelda, link, and the fairies find a cave in the mountains and traverse the evils and traps inside to free Gorons trapped inside the cave. ( upside down hanging from the ceiling luke skywalker style) the evil creature is a giant snow yeti (from TP) and bear wolf has to maul him while Zelda shoots icicles down from the cave roof to stun him. Then goron link can knock him around good. But the last part of the fight, Link must use a whip to hold him down while Zelda goes in for the kill with her Sword! (A nice change up) \n DARK LINK: \n Dark link shows up with several dark figures at the cave enterance and he goes all wolf mode to fight link. Link must fight him in beast form. This fight is pretty hard as well as super sweet looking, because the moon will be shining through the gentle snow falling in the night as the pale light descends on the battling beasts in the cave mouth. Link is about to lose because dark link is so strong and the other figures could jump in and kill the hylians any second. Then dark link tackles link and has him pinned down, a dark figure pulls out an axe and puts it to links throat. Zelda is helpless to defend her Link as the other figures hold her against her will. As all hope seems lost, a womans chuckle cuts through the air. \"I thought I banished you fools to that dreaded chamber\" the moonlight shines on the outline of a girl, and as she walks into view, the night sky illuminates the face of Midna! With a wave of her hand the axe flys to the wall. link springs up from under dark link and midna leaps on link to ride him as in TP. Link and Midna Battle dark link and the evil ones to save Zelda. They defeat them and they retreat into darkness. \n MIDNA'S RETURN: \n Midna explains that the figures were twili that were loyal to Zant and they were supposed to be banished to a ritual chamber in this land. They must have grown in power somehow and broke the seal. She doesn't have a clue what dark link is though. She joins Zelda and link and the fairies as they come back to the goron chieftain who is so thankful and gives Link a key piece. He tells the Heros That the Zora ambassador has requested aid from them, \"but we really cant swim, could you go help them in my stead?\" At this point Midna becomes links companion, as Zelda says that she wont be much help because she isn't a strong swimmer. She goes back to the stockpot inn to try and get info on where the heros grave is. \n GREAT BAY \n So Link and Midna take off to the great bay. At the entrance to great bay, they see a grave with a bone guitar. Wolf link can go sniff around and dig it up to find the Zora mask! With it, zora link can zoom through the water to Zora city. Midna uses magic to slice through the water as well. At zora hall the new zora band is playing ( it is the zora eggs all grown up) but they are missing their guitat player. The heros consult the leadera of the zora, japas and lulu. They mistake link for Mikau at first but link says its \"a commom mistake\". The zoras tell of a fierce sea beast that has been lurking by the pirate fortress. It could be the pirates weapon against the Zora, and Rikau went off to go fight it but hasn't been seen since. They will give link the key in exchange for rikaus safe return. \n PIRATE FORTRESS \n At the pirate fortress link and midna sneak around to find Rikau. He is locked in the prison. After rescuing him he tells them that the pirates think the Zora have unleashed the beast on them! The heros try to escape, but when they go outside the beast attacks the pirate fortress! A huge kracken explodes from the bay and assaults everyone! Link saves the pirate lord and gains her trust. Together the heros and pirates work to defeat the kracken! Link must turn zora and then wolf to transform into an otter like zora wolf. He can swim so fast and shoot up out of the water to attack the beast. Midna and link fly out of the water and on top of the beast. Midna uses magic to still the beasts jaws as link goes in its mouth to deliver the killing blow! The heros return to zora hall and reunite rikau with his family. Lulu gives link her key piece and the heros are on their way back to stockpot inn to meet up with Zelda. \n IKANA CANYON \n Zelda informs them that she has learned the last piece is in the heros grave in ikana somewhere. All three of them set off with the fairies to claim the key. in ikana a village has sprung up around the music house. The village is trying to become a succesful place but the mayor of ikana says that rumors of ghosts are plaguing ikana. Especially rumors of the death dealer. He will tell them the location of the heros grave if they snuff out the rumors. After investigation it turns out the rumors are true! They track the ghost to the rivers source, the cave overlooking the village. Midna and zelda help link solve the puzzles in the cave and they find the ghost at the bottom of the cave. All three of them work together to defeat the ghost. They bring the death dealers weapon to the mayor as proof. He lets link keep it. He also gives link the location of the heros grave. It is high in the canyon by stone tower. \n HERO'S GRAVE \n Upon reaching the location they find a peacful yet eerie resting place of a hero. Link pushes back the grave to reveal a chest. The chest has the last key piece and a note in it. \"Link, I have left you the power to repel evil. Hidden in the deep protected by serpents. I have left you the protection on the night, hidden in water high above. Take my power and use it to save Termina. Take my armor, may it give you courage.\" The armor is thay of the fierce diety! However when the key Is put together it is revealed to be the ocarina of time!!! This is the key to gettimg back to hyrule. But ominous music plays as ghiraham and dark link walk up with a dark figure. The figure removes her hood and she has red hair and blue skin. She is Metra, Midna's little sister. Who is now leading the twili. They are trying to revive midna and Metra's older sister. By using ghiraham to put her spirit into Gannons body! He is missing his fallen master. The twili needed link and zelda to come and gether the ocarina and also so Gannon could have his revenge. As well as metra and her sister getting revenge on midna. \n STONE TOWER PART 1 \n They steal the ocarina and retreat to stone tower. The heros climb the tower to recover the ocarina. However when they reach the door to twinmolds chamber its too late. They arrive in the sandy arena to see Gannondorf being healed with the ocarina and... majoras mask on his face!!! The twili created the mask! It contained metra and midnas sisters spirit... the spirit of majora!!!! The ocarina was the key to unite the two evil beings. Majora/gannon rises and has an evil monologue. Then raises his hands and spills the veil of twilight on Termina. The heros black out as the darkness falls. \n TERRIBLE FATE: \n Link awakens at the stockpot inn with happy mask salesman over him. \"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?\" (So epic) he tells them the tale of MM and then Midna explains how evil and powerful her sister majora was and how they sealed her in the mask. And how metra is so powerful. HMS tells them they need the power of the fierce deity now to defeat this evil. And the ocarina back. link shows them the note and HMS sends them to find the sword of the fierce deity, the shield of the moon, and the ocarina of time. Termina is now riddled with evil twili fighting the natives of the land. Link can go get the 3 items in any order. \n MOON SHIELD: \n The shield is at the woodfall shrine but is guarded by the twili Lycia, whi turns into a giant dragonfly praying mantis thing. Link and zelda must fight their way to the top of woodfall and solve puzzles to navigate the twilight traps and defenses. The boss fight takes place by runnkng around the swamp as deku wolf link and fighting Lycia or by flying over the swamp as deku link. Either way, hylian link must fight her atop woodfall and she has a sick scythe. The moon shield will then be links to claim. \n FIERCE DEITY SWORD: \n The sword is hidden at the bottom of the sea snake cave. Its stabbed in the sea floor and shines in the moonlight that bathes the cave. But it is guarded by the twili Bracken Zul, a huge crocodile like beast with a hook tail. Him and link have a sword to hook fight on top of the cave . Then link can claim the famed double helix sword. \n OCARINA OF TIME: \n The ocarina has been hidden in the snowhead temple and guarded by nereza, a twili snow cat that fights link fiercely but falls. \n BATTLE OF IKANA: \n With all of the items, link zelda and midna come to ikana to face gannon/majora. But the races have all banded together and launched an assault on stone tower. Zoras and gorons fighting with dekus pirates and terminians. The twili army defends the tower and is led by Kaiser, the iron knuckle like twili. He is more skeletal and wields a massive axe. The heros prevail and link must battle kaiser without midna or zelda. He defeats him, but metra shows up with ghiraham and they take zelda and midna. \n STONE TOWER PART 2 \n Link must climb stone tower alone to save his girls. He can choose to rescue zelda or midna first. Then the other will be rescued by both the heros midna is guarded by metra and zelda by dark link. After saving them, all three head up to fight ghiraham. As they beat him he flips the tower upside down. As the heros regain their surroundings majora/gannon tells them to look down and they see the evil moon. It will be the revenge of both of them to kill every last person in termina. \n FATE OF TERMINA: \n After a small fight the villain transforms into a beast and runs towards clocktown, link turns wolf and midna rides him while Zelda keeps up on horseback. They chase/fight him all the way to the clocktower. He transforms again to a humanoid thing and they fight on top of the tower in classic tennis style. Then he goes crazy and transforms into a massive dragon/swine that flys around clocktower, zelda can hit him with her bow and midna can stun him with her magic, but link can deliver the good hits with his fierce deity sword. Finally, he turns into a human again and fights them sword to sword. Link and zelda also habe swords as well as midna having a staff. Together they can stun and hurt him and also distract him. In a last ditch effort, gannon goes to kill whoever you rescued first (midna or zelda ) and the other takes the hit for them while link impales gannom with the blase right through the heart. \n ENDING: \n link and the princess hold the girl who got stabbed. Link sheds a tear and pulls out his ocarina, and plays the song of healing. The girl wakes up and hugs link. Then the other princess hugs her. They walk down the stairs to hear the sound of the cogs turning and the HMS standing by the door. He tells them that the evil has been vanquished, if only for a time. They have saved termina. He teaches link a melody that will take him back to Hyrule. The melody is the Zelda theme song ( dum-dum. Dum dum duh daduuuuh) Link and Midna say their goodbyes again and share a quick kiss. She says something like, \"I will always be waiting for you, my handsome beast.\" Then disappears into the darkness. Link looks deep into Zelda's eyes, and she says, \"and i will always be here for you, my handsome knight\" she wraps her arms around link as the beautiful melody pours out of links ocarina and bathes them in white light. In a second, they are right outside Hyrule castle and in each other's arms. They share a kiss with the silhouette of hyrule castle in the background illuminated by the full moon. The sounds of the ocarina fade as \"The End\" rolls across the screen. \n CONCLUSION Now of course you are brought back to clocktown when you start your game back up and can finish all your sidequests, collect your missing hearts, and maybe even some masks and treasures. The main mechanics of the game will be puzzle solving with different forms and tools (hookshot, dekuwolf, whip, etc) the transforming into a wolf form will be much like using an item or mask, very fast and easy. The fairy tael and your princess companion will be able to guide you when you need it, and it will focus on using you AND the princess to solve puzzles ( think like the earth temple in WW) also link could get different tunics (green blue red black) and different armor. ( hylian, gold, fierce deity) of course there would be the staple bow and bombs, but maybe a ball and chain or the clawshots as well. Most of the people in termina will think they know link BECAUSE MM link left the note in the grave as well the sword, shield, ocarina,..etc. He did this because he knew if the world needed saving again another link would come to save the day. He knew passed strangely in Termina and that it was different in hyrule. Because in Hyrule, from MM to TP was hundreds of years. But in termina it has only been 20 years. Maybe MM link spent 3 days in termina, but it was 7 years in Hyrule? Anyways he uses some unkown magic to ger back to Hyrule and become the heros shade. Termina is a PARALLEL world so this could seem plausible. Again if yall have anything to add or change to make better just tell me. Let's make this the best theoretical Zelda game ever! I am just a Zelda fan wanting another trip to Termina and thought i found a decent way to tie it in to TP. Let me know what yall think! Thank you \n-Bugg \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nFor one tortured weekend, the parents of Kayla Mueller refused to believe that their daughter was dead. From their home in Prescott, Ariz., they issued an impassioned plea to the Islamic State, which had held her captive since August 2013, and urged the extremist organization to contact them privately with proof of her death. The militants acquiesced and sent at least three photographs of her corpse. \n \n Those photos are among the few clues about her life and death in captivity, as is a letter that she wrote from her cell last year and that her family made public on Tuesday. \n \n Two people briefed on the family’s communication with the Islamic State said that her parents had received at least three photos. Two showed Ms. Mueller, who was 26, in a black hijab, or Muslim head covering, that partly obscured her face. Another showed her in a white burial shroud, which is used in traditional Muslim funerals. The images showed bruises on the face, but both people, who reviewed the photographs and asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter, said it remained unclear whether her injuries were consistent with being killed in the rubble of a flattened building, as the Islamic State reported. ||||| [This report was updated Feb. 11 to include a statement from the White House National Security Council.] \n \n Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n With the confirmed death of Kayla Mueller, new details have emerged about the American hostage’s experience in ISIS captivity, including the belief by some officials that she had been given over to a commander in the jihadi group. \n \n \"ISIS didn't see her as a hostage or a bargaining chip,\" a counter-terrorism official told ABC News. \n \n \"Reflections\" in the limited collection of intelligence in Syria -- like indirect indications of a person's presence somewhere, such as ISIS fighters referring to her in calls or spotted guarding a sensitive site where she might have been held -- indicated Kayla was still alive and sometimes in the company of an ISIS leader being actively tracked who had custody over her, possibly by forced marriage, officials told ABC News. \n \n Sometimes she was with her ISIS keeper and other times she was not, two officials said. \n \n The Daily Courier \n \n The U.S. has no ground-level intelligence from Syrian human sources or American spies and so relies on \"airborne collection platforms\" like satellites and drones, officials have said. \n \n Mueller's family in a public plea to ISIS on Friday said the terrorists had referred to her as a \"guest\" in private communications. \n \n In a letter written by Mueller last year and released by the family today, Mueller said she was \"in a safe location, completely unharmed [and] healthy.\" \n \n \"I have been treated with the utmost respect [and] kindness,\" she wrote. \n \n Matt Olsen, former head of the National Counterterrorism Center and current ABC News consultant, said ISIS is known to for the “practice of essentially selling off, or putting young women and girls in the company of ISIS militants.\" \n \n A former law enforcement official involved in the American hostage cases told ABC News Mueller was briefly able to communicate with some male hostages by passing them handwritten messages. For the most part, she was kept away from the other hostages, the official said. \n \n Several counter-terrorism officials told ABC News there were \"a few ideas but no real clue\" of Mueller’s whereabouts with ISIS in Syria over the months since an August deadline for a $6.6 million ransom with accompanying death threat passed -- but U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria were carefully coordinated to avoid killing hostages. \n \n \"We haven't hit any areas where we thought she might be,\" another official said. In announcing Mueller’s death, ISIS claimed she had perished in a coalition airstrike launched by Jordan. \n \n A few weeks ago U.S. officials \"lost fidelity\" on her status entirely, several officials confirmed. \n \n The Mueller family had not received a proof of life, likely an audio recording of her voice, since last year, officials and a source close to the hostage case told ABC News. She also was never mentioned or shown in any of the brutal hostage execution videos released by ISIS. \n \n But recently, evidence of a visual sighting of Kayla last fall in Syria was obtained by intelligence agencies and was deemed credible, several counter-terrorism officials said. But, since the sighting was months ago, it gave no hard indication of her location this year. \n \n Her last proof of life was in May, and then the ransom demand and death threat deadline passed by in August apparently without her execution. \n \n Then over the weekend, ISIS provided the family with \"information,\" including photographic evidence that convinced the U.S. intelligence community that Mueller had been killed, according to a senior U.S. official. U.S. officials said it has not been possible to determine when or how Mueller actually died. \n \n Update: White House National Security Council Statement \n \n Out of respect for Kayla's family, we have not shared details regarding her time in ISIL [ISIS] captivity. In addition, as we have consistently made clear in the past, we do not discuss intelligence. At this time, given the distress that anonymously-sourced reports regarding Kayla's time in captivity are causing her family, we are providing this comment with the Mueller family's consent. \n \n Reports that have been published by certain news outlets regarding Kayla's time in ISIL [ISIS] captivity are speculative and unproven at this time. The U.S. Government continues to analyze any information regarding Kayla's captivity but has not corroborated any of the multiple theories regarding the conditions throughout the duration of her captivity. \n \n For a first-hand account of Kayla's time in captivity, we encourage people to read the letter written by Kayla in captivity, which was released by Kayla's parents earlier this week. ||||| Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google Plus \n \n Embed 2:10 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Friends and family of slain ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller said they hoped her death would achieve what she'd worked for before she was kidnapped: raising the awareness of Syrian refugees. \n \n \"The things that were important to Kayla are finally getting the attention they deserve,\" aunt Lori Lyon said in a tearful news conference in her hometown of Prescott, Arizona, Tuesday — hours after the family confirmed that Mueller had died while in ISIS' hands. \n \n The Rev. Kathleen Day, who runs the United Christian Ministry at Northern Arizona University, where Mueller was a student, recalled following her blog posts from Syria. \"I hope you can tell the entire world here what I've said here, and what I've seen,\" Mueller wrote, according to Day. The pastor also recalled Mueller's recollection of refugees' frequent response when they learned she was American: \"Where is the world?\" \n \n \"We're right here, Syria,\" Day said. \"We've seen your suffering reflected in Kayla's eyes.\" \n \n Eryn Street, a close friend of Mueller's, recalled her seemingly limitless empathy. \"She had an amazing ability to share in someone else's suffering and add a little happiness to it,\" Street said. \n \n She added: \"I'm not yet sure how to live in a world without Kayla, but I do know we're living in a better world because of her.\" \n \n Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google Plus \n \n Embed 2:08 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n In an interview with BuzzFeed News on Tuesday, President Obama called Mueller \"an outstanding young woman and a great spirit — and I think that spirit will live on.\" \n \n He added, \"I think the more people learn about her, the more they appreciate what she stood for and how it stands in contrast with the barbaric organization that held her captive ... but I don't think it's accurate ... to say that the United States government hasn't done everything we could.\" \n \n The family of Abdul-Rahman Kassig, another American aid worker who was captured by ISIS and who was murdered by the group, offered its condolences Tuesday. \n \n We mourn with the Muellers over the death of their daughter, Kayla Mueller. She lived a life of service. She will be remembered! — Kassig Family (@kassigfamily) February 11, 2015 \n \n Mueller, 26, was confirmed dead Tuesday morning, four days after ISIS claimed she'd been killed by a coalition airstrike in Syria. \n \n A senior U.S. official said the evidence consisted of a photograph emailed to the family and \"appears to show her dead with trauma injuries.\" But the official said the injuries were not consistent with injuries suffered by victims of an airstrike. \n \n Jen Psaki, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman, said the government were not able to confirm a cause of death. \"The U.S. military has indicated that there was no evidence of civilians in the target area prior to any recent coalition airstrikes,\" Psaki said. \n \n Kayla Jean Mueller in a photo released by her family.

And let's not forget who's ultimately responsible for it: ISIL,\" Kirby said, using an alternate acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. \n \n Mueller traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border to work with refugees in December 2012, and was taken captive in Aleppo, Syria on Aug. 4, 2013, while leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital. Her family asked the media to keep her name out of the press out of fears it would endanger her life. \n \n Mueller was among the U.S. hostages Army Delta Force commandos unsuccessfully tried to rescue in an operation in Raqqa last July. And Congressman Paul Gosar, a Republican whose district encompasses Mueller's hometown, told the Arizona Republic this week that there were other plans to rescue Mueller that either failed or were shot down by her family as too risky. ||||| An attempt to rescue Kayla Mueller and other American hostages occurred in a July 4 raid previously disclosed by the Pentagon. \n \n U.S. special forces commandos conducted a raid in the predawn hours on a prison in Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqah. \n \n But the mission was unsuccessful because hostages -- which included Mueller as well as American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- had already been moved and weren't there at the time. \n \n \"We never stopped trying to get her,\" said a defense official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter. \"We never lost that focus.\" \n \n President Obama confirmed for the first time Tuesday that Mueller was one of the hostages Delta Force commandos ‎attempted to rescue in a raid on an oil refinery facility in northern Syria in summer 2014. The two dozen commandos arrived a day or two after the hostages had been moved from the site, Obama said. \n \n \"I deployed an entire operation -- at significant risk -- to rescue not only her but the other individuals who had been held, and probably missed them by a day or two,\" Obama said during an interview with BuzzFeed News. \n \n Obama said the U.S. has a commitment to devote \"enormous\" resources to free hostages anywhere in the world.‎ \n \n Relatives of Mueller, who was abducted while volunteering in Syria, announced Tuesday that they had received confirmation that she is dead. \n \n CAPTION Friends, family praise Kayla for her empathy, compassion Friends, family praise Kayla for her empathy, compassion CAPTION Friends, family praise Kayla for her empathy, compassion Friends, family praise Kayla for her empathy, compassion CAPTION The family of hostage American aid worker Kayla Mueller says they have received confirmation of her death.

CAPTION White House confirms death of hostage Kayla Mueller White House confirms death of hostage Kayla Mueller \n \n Islamic State released a video last week claiming that Mueller, 26, was killed in an air attack by coalition forces against the militants in Syria. \n \n U.S. intelligence officials believe that Mueller is dead but don't accept the militants' account of how she was killed, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in Washington on Tuesday. \n \n There was no evidence civilians were in the area that was targeted by Jordan on Friday, Earnest said. \n \n The Pentagon confirmed that Jordanian warplanes bombed a weapons storage facility Friday, but there was no indication that Mueller was there at the time, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. \n \n “We do not know the circumstances surrounding her death,” he said. “U.S. intelligence had no evidence that there were any civilians at the location of this weapons storage facility that was struck by Jordanian F-16s.” \n \n The building, a facility near the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqah, was hit Friday and at least twice before, he said. \n \n Regardless of how Mueller died, he said, her Islamic State captors were to blame. “They are responsible for her safety and well-being,” Earnest said. \n \n Mueller's family members released a statement saying that they had received confirmation of her death. They did not disclose how they learned the information. \n \n However, a source close to the family who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the communications said a private message containing additional information from the captors was sent to Mueller's parents over the weekend. Once the statement was authenticated by the intelligence community, the family concluded that she was dead, the source said. \n \n “We are heartbroken to share that we’ve received confirmation that Kayla Jean Mueller has lost her life,” her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, and her brother, Eric, said in the statement. \n \n U.S. officials are aware of at least one other American being held in the region, Earnest said. He did not identify the individual, or the group holding the captive. But he may have been referring to Austin Tice, an American journalist and former Marine who disappeared in Syria in August 2012. \n \n It is unclear who is holding Tice, but his parents, Debra and Marc Tice, have said that they don't believe he is in the hands of Islamic State militants. \n \n \"Our hearts go out to the Mueller family and everyone who loves Kayla,\" the family said in a statement posted on a website that aims to raise awareness about Austin Tice's captivity. \"We have no way of understanding what they are going through, and we wish them all possible comfort.\" \n \n In Washington, the White House released a statement of condolence from President Obama. \n \n \"On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I convey our deepest condolences to Kayla’s family -- her parents, Marsha and Carl, and her brother Eric and his family -- and all of those who loved Kayla dearly,\" the statement said. \"At this time of unimaginable suffering, the country shares in their grief.\" \n \n Mueller had a long history of volunteering to help women and children, having worked for aid groups in Arizona before setting out for other countries, including India and Turkey. \n \n In August 2013, she was abducted in the Syrian city of Aleppo as she left a hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders and was being held in Raqqah, a militant stronghold in northeastern Syria. \n \n The family statement also included letters Mueller wrote to her family, including one on her father’s birthday in 2011. \n \n “Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love,” she wrote. “I find God in suffering. I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.” \n \n After attending Northern Arizona University, she worked with aid groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories. She returned to Arizona in 2011, where she worked at an HIV/AIDS clinic and volunteered at a women's shelter. Late that year, she moved to southeastern France and worked as an au pair while learning French in preparation for a planned move to Africa. \n \n But the plight of families fleeing the violence in war-torn Syria drew her to Turkey in December 2012. She worked with the aid groups Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council, assisting women and children who crossed into Turkey as refugees. \n \n She also made some trips into Syria to help reconnect family members separated by the fighting. Her trips into the country took her to Aleppo, where she was eventually kidnapped. \n \n In correspondence to her family, which she slipped to other detainees who were being freed, Mueller was contrite and seemed to try to assuage her family’s worry. She told them she was being treated well and was not in harm’s way. \n \n “If you could say I have ‘suffered’ at all throughout this whole experience it is only in knowing how much suffering I have put you all through; I will never ask you to forgive me as I do not deserve forgiveness,” Mueller wrote in a letter the family said it received in the spring of last year. \n \n She said in the letter that she was willing to wait for her freedom if it meant that her family would be absolved of the burden of negotiating her freedom. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_014", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nI apologize in advance, 'cause this is gonna get  long . \n Four or five months ago, something changed for me. It came one night while I was brushing my teeth. \n I was wearing my oldest, rattiest t-shirt (junior-high old - and I'm 23 and a half) and no bottoms (which i never do) and I happened to look at myself in the mirror for a long moment, when something strange happened. An image appeared in my head, and for a second, I thought \"Huh. In this outfit, i look like a girl wearing just her boyfriend's old shirt and her underwear.\" It was both an idle thought and a bizarrely weighty one. From that moment on, it wouldn't leave me. I went to sleep thinking nervous circles around the idea of wearing girls' underwear, something i had never really tried before. I woke up still thinking about it. I went to work the next day and my head was swimming with these anxious, probing thoughts, half-formed questions about who and what i really was. this lasted for, i think, three days, before i couldn't take it anymore. i went out and i bought a pair of panties. i put them on that night before bed, expecting to feel a surge of some kind of dramatic feeling, after all this tension built up, but instead it was... relief? Almost like nothing. It was the absence of the anxiety and the questions and the obsessive thoughts. My mind was just  quiet . \n After that, i came to realize what I was feeling every day. It fit pretty well under the description of gender dysphoria: there was this constant nagging sense of wrongness and discomfort, of my body being ill-fitting to what it contained, manifesting in cycles of building anxiety and then emotional exhaustion, numbness.  All through the workday i would be a squirming, anxious wreck, and then by the time i got home all the bad feelings would be gone - but the thoughts they were attached to, the abstract notions of being in the wrong flesh, of people seeing me all  wrong , those persisted. They just didn't have the same torturous emotional weight, like they'd just burnt me out. Then i'd put on my panties at night, and again i would feel quiet. Only for the cycle to start again the next day. \n This went on for a couple of weeks before i told my therapist. By then I'd bought more girls' underwear, and some actual clothes, too. My days were consumed by dysphoric thought-patterns; i'd notice the shape of my shadow out of the corner of my eye and be struck by a pang of sick feelings. Et cetera. And then there was the doubt. Of course I was wondering if this meant I was transgender; i took the COGIATI and got category 4, \"Probable Transsexual\" - twice. [Four times, by now.] But there was a very significant part of me that was just doubt incarnate, and every time i would think i had landed on a conclusion, it would creep up with all this evidence and these counter-arguments about why that couldn't possibly be true. To the doubt in me, every moment I was free from dysphoria (without having to dress my way out of it) was just more proof that I was a fraud, that this was some kind of twisted bid for attention, a desperate desire to feel unique that was causing me to latch on to a marginal identity. I had no idea what was real; was the dysphoria a delusion? was the doubt a crutch? It was an endless loop of uncertainty, a labyrinth of spiraling doubts. \n I told my therapist i thought i might be transgender, told her all about what had been happening. I told her about how strange it was, 23 years and not a hint of this until it hit me one night like a bolt from the blue. Later, i would tell my brother to imagine that he was just standing in the bathroom one night and suddenly a bullet came through the window and lodged itself in his arm. That's how sudden and strange this was. \n And yet, as i talked it through in therapy, i could see traces, little ghosts of what was to come hiding throughout my past. The way i'd never had any of the acceptable masculine interests, unless you count video games; the way I had liked it when the neighbor girls would take me into their room and paint my toenails when i was little, even though i knew it wasn't meant for boys. The way i'd had crushes that bordered on hero-worship, as if some part of me was blurring the line between wanting her and wanting to be her. The way i had liked to play dress-up, to walk around in my mother's shoes. The way I had sometimes ended up wearing girl clothes in high school without even meaning to, just because I pulled something I really liked off the rack I didn’t realize was ‘wrong’. \n I started to realize that I had no memory of ever having consciously identified as male. I didn't remember ever accepting or embracing masculinity like my brothers seemed to. I just remember it feeling a little alien to me, without me being able to articulate that until now. I remembered reading  Stranger in a Strange Land  in sophomore year, and how the book’s gender- and sexuality-defying slant had resonated with me, how I had recognized myself as feeling like deep-down, gender maybe didn’t quite reach me or apply to me in the way people assumed it to. \n I became fairly convinced that I was transgender. So, after a few weeks of talking it over in therapy and coping with the dysphoria, I decided to tell my best friend. He’s a wonderfully sweet, loyal person; sometimes I wonder if he’s not actually a golden retriever who decided to take human form. He said he wasn’t surprised. He told me that he’d always noticed my negative comments about my body had seemed…  weird , to him. Like it was something more visceral and strange than merely feeling like I was unattractive. When he said that, I knew he was right. All through my teenage years, I was always frustrated with the maleness of my body, though I framed it a bit differently.  I wish I was skinny and waifish and pretty , I always told myself (and sometimes my friends). I had always written it off as wanting to look like an anime boy, at the time. But sometimes the lumpy, hairy, angular, pudgy squareness of my body would get me so upset I’d self-harm ─ not in a really serious, permanent way, just punching myself in the stomach and things like that. Just every once in a while. \n But the fact remained: I was starting to notice a pattern, a history to this seemingly out-of-nowhere thing taking root inside me. So, with the support of my best friend, I did the only thing that seemed right, and confessed to my girlfriend. A little background here: the two of us have been together for almost six years. At 23, that’s nearly a quarter of our lives. We’ve felt like soulmates, even though neither of us believes in soulmates, for a while now. We’re very, very close, and since we’ve been both next-door-neighbors and college roommates, we’ve spent almost every day together since May of 2010, the month of our high school graduation. \n I told her. It was the second-worst night of my life. She sobbed like she was dying, and after a while, so did I. At first it was just an outpouring of grief, as we both fought off the feeling that our lives were over, because we couldn’t be together anymore if this was the case. But then things took a stranger turn. She started…  questioning  me. Pointing things out that didn’t sit right with her, little indicators that led her to believe this wasn’t completely true, like something was missing from the picture. As first, I was resistant, but I listened to her, even gratefully after a while, as we talked it through. She said there were things about me that definitely seemed male, that I didn’t really understand what being a girl was like. We convinced each other, over the next few hours, that I probably wasn’t transgender. I probably wasn’t a girl. I had to be something in the middle ─ still worth exploring, but different in the key sense of being livable. It was like a compromise that our relationship could handle. \n That was three or four months ago, now. In the meantime, it’s been a bit of a double life for me. During the great majority of the day, I have to maintain my masculine presentation, at work and with my family and friends. Every once in a while, I steal away to go shopping, and when I’m alone in my room, in the hours before bed, I experiment with gender. Slowly but surely, I edge closer to full-on feminine presentation; first it was panties and bralettes, then there were shorts and camis, followed by cardigans and sweaters, and then lipstick and a nightdress, until, the other day, I finally bought a full-on, actual dress. I’m trying these things out and finding them comfortable, finding that they all have the same quality of stilling the dysphoric thoughts, even dispelling the constant, wordless awareness of it, the background-radiation form of dysphoria that is little-felt but always there. It all seems to fade, when I’m dressed up. And in its place rises this lovely, subtle feeling of purity: of being in touch with my soul in a way that I wasn’t before. I keep waiting, as I dig deeper and deeper into feminine expression, to find some kind of stopping-point, like a barrier that I’ll hit where I realize “nah, this part isn’t for me, this is the limit” ─ because I’ve been understanding myself as genderqueer, so I expect to have some kind of middle ground, right? Because if what feels right for me is full female expression, rather than a mix of genders, then… I’m back where I started, aren’t I? I must be trans after all. \n The doubt is stronger than ever, now. I feel my mind splitting into three parts, each with their own beliefs and agendas. One part is expecting this all to pass, assuming it to be some kind of short-lived phase that will leave me feeling oh so silly when it’s all over ─  you’re just a normal boy , it says.  Get over it.  Another part suspects that this is definitely real, but is convinced that I must be “just” genderqueer, or genderfluid, or a demigirl, or whatever mid-spectrum term works the best ─  don’t be too hasty , it warns;  don’t go getting carried away, thinking crazy tranny thoughts . And the last part of me earnestly believes that I was right all along, that I’m a trans girl ─  trust your feelings , it tells me. But beneath all of them, connected to all of them, is a fourth part, the part of pure doubt: it uses my own capacity for logic and self-reflection as a mercenary weapon, fighting for all sides and none. My mind is a never-ending debate, where all three sides, fueled by this fourth indestructible quantum of doubt, seek to undermine and debunk each other. I have no idea what to believe, what thoughts to trust and what to dismiss. I don’t know what I am or where I’m going. I don’t know what’s real within my own mind. I feel so... unspooled. \n This last week, I told two more people. First was my best female friend (besides my partner), and then my favorite brother. Both of them had more or less the same response as my best friend, the first one I told; they both seemed unsurprised. It made sense, they told me, without any sense of judgment or even distress in their reactions. They seemed less surprised or upset by it than I was. \n Then there was this weekend. I hung out with some old friends, while wearing an outfit of mostly feminine or gender-neutral clothing, but in a way that wasn’t very noticeable ─ crossdressing in stealth, essentially. And it felt good. I noticed a shift in my personality, as if the clothes brought out the truer form of me. There were moments where I actually kind of  saw  myself as a girl, that evening. The next morning, at therapy, I wore a black dress and a girl’s sweater, my hair in pigtails done up just right, red lipstick on my lips, my face freshly shaved. It didn’t feel like crossdressing. It felt right. More and more, I was experiencing myself as female. I felt more sureness, more of a sense of something real, than I had in weeks. Until that evening, when I got together with a different set of friends to go look at Christmas lights, and I noticed something disquieting: the dysphoria was hardly there at all. I barely thought or felt anything about my gender at all, the whole evening. And that was upsetting, because the doubt latched onto it and used it to dismantle the precious feeling of mostly-sureness that I had arrived at only that same morning. I was cut loose, adrift once again, and worse than before. \n This all leads up to last night. My girlfriend and I, due to a series of shitty events, ended up talking about it all over again. She wanted to know if our safe compromise was still holding true, if I still felt like I was really genderqueer, instead of being a girl. I told her the truth, that I was more uncertain than ever before, but she could tell I was leaning toward the trans theory. Things got heated, and I lashed out, admonishing her for the way she’d spoken to me in our first conversation, months ago. She had said these things to me, little insinuations that had taken root in my mind, exponentially feeding my own innate tendency to doubt and question: “You know sometimes your imagination gets you carried away”, “I think you’re biased, you’re ignoring all the evidence”, “It seems like your obsessing over it blew it out of proportion”, things along that sort of gist. I blamed her for breeding this monstrous doubt that refuses to let me have a clear answer. We fought each other terribly, and apologized in turn. She said she hadn’t meant to do that, to make me distrust my own feelings and question the validity of my thoughts, my reality. She had never intended to throw me for a loop like that. \n But then the fight cycled back around, and she said more of the same, this time even worse. “I  think you  want  it to be true,” she said, when I suggested the possibility of me being trans. “For some reason, you’re  trying  to see it that way.” I told her point-blank the damaging effect those words would have on my ability to understand my situation, but she had already said it. Now I trust myself even less, though I don’t trust her any more than that. After all, who stands to lose more from my transition, should that be what I decide to do? She needs me, she’s told me. Her family life is in shambles, she tells herself she has no friends, but there’s always been me. I try to tell her, “Maybe  you’re  biased, maybe  you  have the ulterior motives,” but she doesn’t listen. I point out to her that everyone else I’ve told, who all have known me as long or longer than she, told me how unsurprised they were to consider me trans, how nonplussed they had all seemed—“They’re just telling you what they can tell you want to hear,” she tells me. We came closer to breaking up for good than we ever have before, but eventually we reconciled. \n Now I am truly and utterly lost. The period of believing I was “just” genderqueer was where the dysphoria seemed at first to fade, though I never stopped having thoughts about my gender and its need to bend. But after a peaceful month or two, it just came creeping back, and I found myself hungry for more and more complete forms of feminine expression. Just when I was feeling almost like I could believe I was trans, for sure this time, the events of the last few days come along and detonate all those feelings of understanding. This week, I’ve decided, I’m going to test myself. I’m not allowing myself to cross-dress or engage in gender-bending experiments in any way, shape, or form, until next Saturday when I see my therapist again. I want to know how that absence makes me feel. It’s the only move I can think of. But I don’t know how to feel. All weekend I was considering this test, and the mere thought of it brought the familiar airless feeling of anxiety to my chest… but today, Day 1 of the new experiment, I feel less dysphoric than I have in a long time. I go looking for thoughts about my gender, and I don’t find a lot. Maybe I’m just exhausted and blown-out from last night, probably the worst night of my life. Or maybe it means something else. \n Please, someone, anyone who might have answers, help me. I am so, so terribly confused. I don’t know what’s going on in my head. I haven’t known for a long time. It’s only getting worse.\nI feel like I’m losing my mind. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1. Identify the main topic and primary arguments presented in the article.\n2.

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nAnticipating a month of heavy lobbying and television advertising by opponents, led by the pro-Israel group Aipac, the president and members of his team are leaning on Democrats to declare their backing for the agreement before they leave Washington to face their constituents. \n \n Mr. Obama, who will decamp to Martha’s Vineyard this weekend for his own two-week vacation, will have limited personal contact with wavering lawmakers, but his team has been instructed to make the president and other senior administration officials available to any skeptic with an unanswered question or concern about the deal. “Anyone who wants a phone call will get one,” one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to outline internal strategy. \n \n Officials said that Mr. Obama’s address on Wednesday would be followed by a series of news media interviews that would be shown next week. And the administration plans to dispatch cabinet members, including Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, the nuclear physicist who helped negotiate the accord, to travel the country outlining its provisions. Mr. Moniz will appear on Friday at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, officials said. \n \n “We are confident that a sizable number of members of Congress will put politics aside and focus on what they believe is in the best interest of the United States and our national security, and if they do, a substantial number of those who follow that path will be supportive of the agreement,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “There’s no denying that there is intense political pressure on both sides of this agreement,” he continued, adding that officials were hoping that lawmakers would “focus on the specific terms of the agreement.” \n \n The effort gained some momentum Tuesday as three closely watched Democratic senators — Barbara Boxer of California, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Bill Nelson of Florida — declared their backing, along with a handful of House Democrats. Mr. Obama’s team is working with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, to build support to potentially sustain a presidential veto of legislation rejecting the accord. ||||| President Obama urged support for the Iran nuclear deal while speaking at American University in Washington. He outlined the deal and denounced critics' claims that the deal would open a pathway for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. VPC \n \n President Obama listens as United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks during their meeting in the Oval Office at the White House Tuesday. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) \n \n WASHINGTON — President Obama will deliver a crucial speech on the Iran nuclear agreement Wednesday, arguing that the congressional vote that could block the deal is \"the most consequential foreign policy debate since the decision to go to war in Iraq,\" the White House said. \n \n White House aides said Obama would \"point out that the same people who supported war in Iraq are opposing diplomacy with Iran, and that it would be an historic mistake to squander this opportunity\" to contain Iran's nuclear program. \n \n The framing of that message appears to be a direct appeal to congressional Democrats; while some opposed the Iraq War, others came to regret their votes to authorize it. Obama will need their votes to get the one-thirds vote necessary to sustain a veto. \n \n Since the Iran deal isn't a treaty, it doesn't need congressional approval, but can be rejected with a two-thirds vote of both chambers. On Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee formally introduced a resolution to do just that, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy promised a September vote once the House returns from its summer recess. \n \n The deal, two years in the making, would relax sanctions against Iran in exchange for a promise not to develop nuclear weapons and inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Critics, including every major Republican presidential candidate, say Iran cannot be trusted and that the economic benefits of the deal will only strengthen Iran's ability to threaten Israel and foment extremism throughout the Middle East. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Obama to \"avoid tired, obviously untrue talking points about this being some choice between a bad deal and war.\" \n \n \"Of course it isn't,\" McConnell said Wednesday. \"He knows it isn't. He himself has said that 'a bad deal is worse than no deal.'\" \n \n Obama made a special appeal to the Jewish community Tuesday, meeting at the White House with about two-dozen leaders of Jewish groups that span the religious and ideological spectrum, including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the liberal J Street, and leaders of reform and orthodox congregations. \n \n The president is trying to counter a determined lobbying campaign by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who continued his months-long effort to scuttle the deal by appealing to American Jews in a webcast Tuesday. \"I don’t oppose this deal because I want war,” he told them. \"I oppose this deal because I want to prevent war.” \n \n Wednesday's speech, at American University in Washington, is already drawing historical parallels. It's the same place President Kennedy gave his 1963 speech proposing a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union at the apex of the Cold War. \n \n The White House seemed to be encouraging those comparisons — to a point. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said both Kennedy and Obama \"entered into a diplomatic agreement with an adversary of the United States that did succeed in advancing the national security interests of the United States.\" \n \n But unlike Kennedy, Earnest said, Obama did not have to make any concessions about its own defense. \"There’s no impact from this nuclear agreement on the United States and either our nuclear programs or our military programs,\" Earnest said Tuesday. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1SML4mR ||||| President Obama lashed out at critics of the Iran nuclear deal on Wednesday, saying many of those who backed the U.S. invasion of Iraq now want to reject the Iran accord and put the Middle East on the path toward another war. \n \n Obama also said that if Congress rejects the deal, it will undermine America’s standing in global diplomacy, leaving the United States isolated and putting Israel in even greater peril. \n \n While calling the nuclear accord with Iran “the strongest nonproliferation agreement ever negotiated,” Obama also seemed to turn the vote on the deal into a referendum on the U.S. invasion of Iraq a dozen years ago, a decision he portrayed as the product of a “mind-set characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy.” \n \n Obama said that when he first ran for president, he believed “that America didn’t just have to end that war. We had to end the mind-set that got us there in the first place.” He added that “now, more than ever, we need clear thinking in our foreign policy.” \n \n It was the president’s sharpest attack yet on opponents of the Iran nuclear deal, which he sees as a defining achievement amid an often rocky foreign policy record. \n \n President Obama hammered critics of the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran, saying Republicans in the Congress who oppose it are making “common cause” with Iranian hard-liners. (AP) \n \n [How the Obama White House runs foreign policy] \n \n In a two-hour White House meeting Tuesday night with Jewish American groups, Obama seemed particularly bothered by a multimillion-dollar ad campaign aimed at stopping the deal. On Wednesday afternoon, the president used his Twitter account to say: “There’s no such thing as a ‘better deal.’ Walking away risks war.” \n \n As he nears the end of his tenure, Obama has been arguing forcefully that diplomacy can yield benefits, even as his administration continues to use targeted strikes by drones and struggles to deal with civil war in Syria, the rise of the Islamic State and confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. \n \n “I have not shied away from using force when necessary,” Obama said, noting he had authorized military actions in seven countries. “. . . I’ve had to make a lot of tough calls as president, but whether or not this deal is good for American security is not one of those calls. It’s not even close.” \n \n Obama spoke from American University, the same venue used by President John F. Kennedy to promote efforts to reach a landmark nuclear test-ban treaty with Moscow at the height of the Cold War. Obama invoked that 1963 speech, saying Kennedy “rejected the prevailing attitude among some foreign policy circles that equated security with a perpetual war footing.” \n \n Instead, Obama said, Kennedy sought “a practical and attainable peace, a peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions, on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements.” \n \n But many observers felt that Obama’s speech was more caustic and partisan than Kennedy’s. “Walk away from this agreement and you will get a better deal — for Iran,” he said to critics. \n \n Here are key moments from President Obama's speech at American University on Aug. 5, addressing the international deal on Iran's nuclear program that Congress is considering. (AP) \n \n At one point, Obama brushed aside comments by Iranian hard-liners who he said do not reflect what all Iranians believe and are the “most comfortable with the status quo.” The president added: “It’s those hard-liners chanting ‘Death to America’ who have been most opposed to the deal. They’re making common cause with the Republican caucus.” \n \n Later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called on Obama “to retract his bizarre and preposterous comments” and said that Democrats who have already stated their opposition would be “insulted” by them. \n \n Obama did not shy away from engaging foes of the Iran deal and linking them to the decision to invade Iraq. \n \n “The single greatest beneficiary in the region of that war was the Islamic Republic of Iran, which saw its strategic position strengthened by the removal of its long-standing enemy, Saddam Hussein,” Obama added. He also noted that when President George W. Bush took office, Iran did not possess any centrifuges, the machines needed to produce nuclear bomb material, while when Obama took office Iran already had installed several thousand. \n \n Even some supporters of the nuclear deal were put off by Obama’s argument. Many critics of the agreement were proponents of war in Iraq, but that does not make them warmongers, said Robert Einhorn, an arms-control and nonproliferation analyst with the Brookings Institution. \n \n “I think it will offend more than convert,” said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center and a former Middle East negotiator at the State Department. Miller supports the agreement but said Obama’s speech “paints those who are not reckless critics of this agreement with a large brush.” \n \n Others who have met directly with Obama said they were impressed by the resolve with which he is making his case. They argue that the president has no choice but to fight against fierce criticism from Republican rivals and some Jewish groups opposed to the deal. \n \n Obama has been irked by ad campaigns against the deal, including one comparing him to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister leading up to World War II, who has been widely blamed with not standing up to Adolf Hitler. \n \n Alexandra Stanton, a board member at J Street, a group that supports the deal, said Obama “has a right to combat what he thinks are campaigns against him laden with non-facts and offensive statements. He has a right to call that out, a right to say he’s concerned about it and that he finds it objectionable.” \n \n Obama appears to have made inroads with some Senate Democrats. On Wednesday, Sens. Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, announced their support. On Tuesday, Sens. Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) and Bill Nelson (Fla.) backed the plan. \n \n But the president has been less successful in wooing opponents among influential Jewish American groups. \n \n “He feels the arguments that have been deployed against the deal are inaccurate and it’s his job to set the record straight,” said Jason Isaacson, who is the director of government and international affairs at the American Jewish Committee and attended the meeting with Obama. \n \n Although Isaacson called Obama “a forceful salesman,” the American Jewish Committee announced Wednesday that it would oppose the nuclear deal. \n \n Republicans also criticized how Obama has framed the debate. \n \n “Does anybody in America believe that if we turn down this deal, this president is going to engage in war with Iran?” asked Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). “That’s one of those straw men that demeans the debate.” \n \n The heart of Obama’s address sought to hammer home the administration’s views that the alternative to the deal is conflict. \n \n “I say this not to be provocative,” Obama said. “I am stating a fact. . . . The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.” \n \n [Both sides court every vote in Congress] \n \n Obama and other top administration officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, have framed the Iran deal as a last chance to roll back Iran’s nuclear ambitions and, in particular, the scope of its ability to enrich uranium. In exchange, international sanctions on Iran would be eased. \n \n Speaking directly to lawmakers opposing the deal, Obama said rejection would cost more than missing a chance to curb Iran’s nuclear program. \n \n “We will have lost something more precious,” he said, “America’s credibility as a leader of diplomacy, America’s credibility as an anchor of the international system.” \n \n Obama emphasized that every nation that has weighed in on the deal has backed it — except Israel, which fears for its own security and whose prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been among the most vocal critics. \n \n “I do not doubt his sincerity, but I believe he is wrong,” Obama said. \n \n The West and its allies fear that Iran’s nuclear fuel facilities could one day be expanded to make weapons-grade material. Iran insists it does not seek nuclear arms but demands that it retain the capacity to make its own fuel for peaceful reactors. \n \n Under the deal reached last month, U.N. inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency would have “unprecedented” access to Iranian nuclear sites, Kerry has told lawmakers. But some critics have questioned provisions that require advance notice — and possible negotiations with Iran — to inspect other areas of possible nuclear-related activity. The procedure could delay inspectors by up to 24 days. \n \n Obama retorted that once an area of suspicion is identified, it would be watched “continuously” until inspectors can get to it and that they would get in even if Iran objects. \n \n Obama also addressed complaints that lifting economic pressures on Iran could end up funding Iran’s military and its proxies in the region, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \n \n “If we are serious about confronting Iran’s destabilizing activities, it is hard to imagine a worse approach than blocking this deal,” he said. “Instead, we need to check the behavior that we are concerned about directly, by helping our allies in the region strengthen their own capabilities.” \n \n The Iran pact faces widespread opposition in Congress — even among some Democrats — before the Sept. 17 deadline to vote. If Congress votes for a bill rejecting the deal, Obama has promised to veto it, setting up the key showdown over whether opponents could muster enough votes to secure an override. \n \n “Shut out the noise,” he urged lawmakers. “Consider the stakes.” \n \n Brian Murphy, Carol Morello, Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis contributed to this report. ||||| Returning to the theme that launched his first White House bid, President Barack Obama pitched his Iran nuclear deal Wednesday by urging Congress not to repeat its mistake of approving the 2003 Iraq War. \n \n “Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option — another war in the Middle East,” Obama warned. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n In tones that alternated between impassioned, incredulous and mocking of the Iran deal’s critics, Obama offered his strongest — and most political — argument yet for the agreement struck on July 14. Departing from the substance of the deal, Obama spent several minutes focusing on the track record of its opponents. \n \n “The same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran deal,” Obama told an audience at American University. He said those critics exaggerate threats, obscure the true costs of war, and prefer military action over diplomacy. \n \n Obama’s target audience: the few dozen undecided House and Senate Democrats who control the fate of the deal in Congress. A day before the first Republican presidential debate, Obama was also speaking to an American public with mixed views on Iran, but which overwhelmingly thinks the Iraq War was a mistake. \n \n More than at anytime in his presidency, Obama reverted to arguments he made repeatedly early in his first presidential bid. Some former aides said the speech brought back memories of Obama’s insurgent primary campaign in Iowa in late 2007. \n \n “When I ran for President eight years ago as a candidate who had opposed the decision to go to war in Iraq, I said that America didn’t just have to end that war — we had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place,” Obama said. \n \n Obama argued that opponents of the deal, who insist that it is too weak, are stuck in the mindset of Washington “conventional wisdom” and a cavalier attitude toward the unpredictable consequences of war. He urged members of Congress, who are expected to vote on the deal in September, to “worry less about being labeled weak [and] worry more about getting it right.” \n \n Unmentioned in Obama’s speech was Hillary Clinton’s 2002 vote to authorize force in Iraq, which likely allowed Obama to derail her path to the 2008 Democratic nomination. Nor did he mention identical votes by two other members of his administration who were then in the Senate: Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden. Several other influential Democrats who backed the war remain in Congress, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. \n \n Obama did not single out any critics, though his voice rose in frustration when he described opposition to the Iran deal “in many cases offered by the same people who seem to have a compunction with being repeatedly wrong, led to a war that did more to strengthen Iran and more to isolate the United States than anything we have done in the decade since.” \n \n The argument drew a quick and angry rebuke from two prominent Iraq War backers who are also fierce critics of the pact. Obama’s address was “another example of his reliance on endless strawmen to divert attention from his failed policies,” said Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham in a joint statement. \n \n Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker also blasted the speech to POLITICO, calling it “partisan” and misleading. \n \n The idea that war is the only alternative to the deal is a “straw man,” Corker said. “Our military officials that have sat with the administration all the way through this have said: Never ever has there been any discussion about the fact if this deal falls apart there will be military action. Never.” \n \n In a statement, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce noted that, in Senate testimony last week, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the U.S. military had “a range of options” for confronting Iran short of war. \n \n Corker suggested that Obama’s emphasis on the undesirability of bombing Iran — which he said would set back its program only a few years with other dangerous consequences — has undermined America’s leverage. \n \n “This president is not going to carry out military action against Iran. Iran knows that,” Corker said. \n \n Obama took care to note that he has ordered military action in seven countries and sent tens of thousands of U.S. troops into battle, nearly all of them in Afghanistan during his first term. \n \n Obama also infuriated some Republicans by arguing that they had made “common cause” with Iranian hard-liners opposed to the deal who chant “Death to America” at public rallies. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement calling the comment “bizarre” and “offensive,” and said it “goes way over the line of civil discourse.” \n \n The assault on critics of the Iran deal book-ended a speech that mainly reiterated Obama’s previous arguments on behalf of the agreement, under which Iran will accept limits on its nuclear program for 10 to 15 years, and in some areas longer, in return for an end to economic sanctions. \n \n Obama repeated his argument that the deal represented the best effort of diplomacy and that a stronger alternative is not plausible. \n \n “Those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy,” Obama argued, one of several instances where he belittled his critics’ arguments. White House officials say Obama has been frustrated with what he considers unserious critiques of the nuclear pact from Republicans. \n \n Elsewhere in the speech, for instance, Obama mocked “lobbyists and pundits [who] were suddenly transformed into armchair nuclear scientists,” second-guessing credentialed experts like Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz. \n \n ”I’ve had to make a lot of tough calls as president. But whether this deal is good for American security is not a tough call. It’s not even close,” Obama said. \n \n If the deal fails, he argued, “the alternatives to a military option will have been exhausted,” and America will be headed toward “another war in the Middle East” with what he called unpredictable consequences. \n \n “If we’ve learned anything from the last decade, it’s that wars in general — and wars in the Middle East in particular — are anything but simple,” Obama said. \n \n Congress can vote to disapprove the deal and prevent Obama from suspending tough U.S. sanctions on Iran, which could bring down the entire agreement. Obama would veto such a measure, and Congress would need a two-thirds vote in each chamber to override it. \n \n Despite a fierce lobbying campaign by opponents of the deal and the government of Israel, the agreement seems likely to survive. But the relentlessness of the administration’s sales pitch — including Obama’s powerful language Wednesday — indicates that the White House is not taking that outcome for granted. \n \n Obama opened his address by recalling a historic speech 52 years earlier at the same location by President John F. Kennedy, who argued for negotiating with the Soviet Union in the name of world peace. “Strength, in his view, included powerful armed forces and a willingness to stand up for our values around the world,” Obama said. “But he rejected the prevailing attitude among some foreign policy circles that equated security with a perpetual war footing.” \n \n The speech opened on a lighter note when Obama, who arrived nearly 40 minutes late, explained the reason for his tardiness: “I apologize for the slight delay,” he said with a grin. “Even presidents have problems with toner.” \n \n Burgess Everett contributed to this report. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Provide a long summary to contain all the needed information.", "response": "\n\nPresident Obama delivered a forceful speech urging congressional approval of the Iran nuclear deal, framing it as a critical decision akin to the Iraq War vote. He sharply criticized opponents, accusing them of advocating for war and exaggerating threats, while arguing that the deal prevents Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and avoids a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East.\n\nObama emphasized that the deal is not just about Iran's nuclear program but also about America's credibility and leadership in the world. He stressed the international support for the agreement, highlighting that every nation except Israel backs the deal. He aimed to counter misinformation and fear-mongering by opponents, particularly those who compare him to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who appeased Hitler before World War II.\n\nThe President directly addressed concerns about the deal's potential to empower Iran's military and its proxies, arguing that lifting sanctions will not necessarily fund these activities. He also countered criticisms about the inspection regime, stating that inspectors will have unprecedented access to Iranian nuclear sites and that any delays in inspections are justifiable and will not compromise the deal's effectiveness.\n\nObama acknowledged the complexities of the deal, admitting that it's not perfect but arguing that rejecting it would be far worse. He challenged Congress to rise above partisan politics and prioritize American security over ideology. He highlighted the choice between diplomacy and war, warning that rejecting the deal would lead to isolation and potentially another conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThe speech targeted undecided Democrats, aiming to secure their votes and ensure the deal's passage. He invoked the legacy of his 2008 campaign, reminding listeners of his opposition to the Iraq War and his commitment to diplomacy over military action. He contrasted his approach with those who supported the Iraq War, highlighting the potential consequences of repeating past mistakes.\n\nObama's speech was met with mixed reactions. Supporters praised his forceful defense of the deal, while opponents criticized his rhetoric and accused him of misrepresenting their arguments. Republican leaders dismissed his comparisons to the Iraq War and questioned his commitment to confronting Iran's destabilizing activities.\n\nDespite the opposition, the White House remains confident that the deal will ultimately be approved. Obama's speech was part of a broader effort to rally support, which includes lobbying by administration officials and media campaigns. As the congressional vote looms, the debate over the Iran nuclear deal continues to be a defining moment in Obama's presidency.\n\nHere are some key quotes from the article:\n\n* \"I have not shied away from using force when necessary. I’ve authorized military actions in seven countries. ... I’ve had to make a lot of tough calls as president, but whether or not this deal is good for American security is not one of those calls. It’s not even close.\" - President Obama\n* \"The single greatest beneficiary in the region of that war was the Islamic Republic of Iran, which saw its strategic position strengthened by the removal of its long-standing enemy, Saddam Hussein.\" - President Obama\n* \"Those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy.\" - President Obama\n* \"The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.\" - President Obama\n\nThe president’s speech at American University marked a critical stage in the debate over the Iran nuclear deal, with the fate of the agreement hanging in the balance.\n"}

I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Really ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh that's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {gap} no\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: A prairie dog ?\nProject Manager: {gap} no {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh a squirrel ?\nProject Manager: That's exactly what it is .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh not a very good one {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not bad I would say .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's pretty good .\nProject Manager: Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Very good .\nMarketing: Ah .\nUser Interface: Alright .\nProject Manager: Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros .\nMarketing: Market range internationally sold .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be {disfmarker} can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .\nMarketing: Ah right okay .\nProject Manager: {gap} experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? Stuff like that . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . {vocalsound} At quarter to twelve . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So I think before we close uh , we are expected {disfmarker} I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: S\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I think we're {disfmarker} I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: oh okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would {disfmarker} roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .\nProject Manager: Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? Pretty much everybody .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I think we've all got {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?\nMarketing: Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: 'Kay um .\nMarketing: Well . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: T\nMarketing: A new remote control for T_V_ . What would I like ? {vocalsound} Um .\nProject Manager: W what {disfmarker} You want it big do you want it small . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Medium .\nUser Interface: Mm . Yeah it seems like there's like {disfmarker} there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Video and ts hi-fi and stuff .\nUser Interface: but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .\nProject Manager: Maybe you {disfmarker} yeah\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per {disfmarker} how much ?\nMarketing: Twelve fifty .\nIndustrial Designer: Twelve fifty . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .\nMarketing: Each .\nProject Manager: Per unit , yeah .\nUser Interface: Cost .\nIndustrial Designer: So do we have to be realistic within the budget or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah .\nMarketing: Guess {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these {disfmarker} any of these ideas are feasible or not .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um .\nMarketing: Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? {vocalsound} Like so you have one in like {disfmarker} mm\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay .\nMarketing: {gap} have slides . And then it all comes compact\nProject Manager: Okay , that's {gap} .\nMarketing: into one . So it's not {disfmarker} you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Th that's an idea .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: So you just flip them out .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {gap} have uh one very complicated one on one side with {vocalsound} all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o {vocalsound} one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and {vocalsound} minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .\nProject Manager: One side for kids , one side for adults .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm not sure if that's like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Or grandma as well , you know it's like {vocalsound} what is the mute button .\nUser Interface: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .\nIndustrial Designer: No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold {disfmarker} like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh .\nProject Manager: Like it {gap}\nUser Interface: Oh okay .\nProject Manager: or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing: That would be cool .\nProject Manager: F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe .\nMarketing: I was thinking that like a flip .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um , oh we've got five minutes left .\nIndustrial Designer: Start breaking up .\nProject Manager: But {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: Okay . Um .\nProject Manager: Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there .\nUser Interface: Yeah , we should uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {gap} .\nUser Interface: I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception {disfmarker} you know {gap} stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: D_V_D_ players , things like that .\nProject Manager: I have got {disfmarker} I think we should also have a back-up plan of {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that {disfmarker} I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just {disfmarker} that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay . Right .\nProject Manager: What do you reckon ? See 'cause , {gap} I'm just thinking {disfmarker} bearing in mind th we've gotta {disfmarker} we have to have something that's cheap to make .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I mean {gap} . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .\nUser Interface: have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: uh simple to use , and looks decent and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: May w you know , maybe even {disfmarker}\nMarketing: But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ?\nProject Manager: Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people\nMarketing: I mean if it's if it's just like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: or so people that uh b don't see very well or {disfmarker} big buttons for {disfmarker} touchy buttons for {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Or just one that looks really fucking cool .\nUser Interface: certain certain demographic {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Could be really light or , I dunno , something special .\nUser Interface: Yeah , no I think you're right . Yeah , rathe rather than focus on {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about {gap} do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Y {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . I mean obviously everyone {disfmarker} we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but {vocalsound} that's not gonna happen .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this {disfmarker} well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and {disfmarker} ooh , the telephone's {disfmarker} the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something .\nProject Manager: Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . But make it like really snazzy and cool {gap} people will want it . So make it {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} No porn channel for children .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Um alright ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: so we've got some ideas , we've got um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I guess that's good good for now .\nProject Manager: Let's move on .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay .\nMarketing: W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ?\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer um which is {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Ah ri okay . {gap} these are requirement specification .\nProject Manager: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing: And I'm marketing .\nProject Manager: Yeah , there you go . {vocalsound} So {gap} {disfmarker} User Interface Designer , that's that's\nUser Interface: That's me . Okay .\nProject Manager: that's you , so you gotta {gap} you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um .\nUser Interface: Right . Right .\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer , you are the one {gap} , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's {gap} what goes into the box , somehow .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Har how it works an\nProject Manager: And in marketing {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Bu\nMarketing: {vocalsound} These are requirement specification .\nProject Manager: User requirements specifications .\nMarketing: So what the user requires\nProject Manager: Yeah , what {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Do you think our two kind of overlap , because {disfmarker}\nMarketing: in a remote .\nProject Manager: Right , okay , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .\nMarketing: I guess that's what it says .\nProject Manager: You two {vocalsound} you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you {disfmarker} working together .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: You're the one that's gotta go and find out {disfmarker} do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay . Okay everyone , well done .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Good meeting .\nUser Interface: Alright , see you in thirty minutes .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So {vocalsound} , do we take these off ?\nIndustrial Designer: I don't {disfmarker} \n[Text End]\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nBut this year, as the line between acceptable political debate and sophistry has often been crossed, the accuracy of campaign statements has emerged as a campaign issue. Here is an examination of some of the claims and counterclaims. \n \n Doubling the Deficit \n \n Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama had doubled the deficit. That is not true. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, the Congressional Budget Office had already projected that the deficit for fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year, would be $1.2 trillion. (It ended up as $1.4 trillion.) For fiscal year 2012, which ended last week, the deficit is expected to be $1.1 trillion — just under the level in the year he was inaugurated. Measured as a share of the economy, as economists prefer, the deficit has declined more significantly — from 10.1 percent of the economy’s total output in 2009 to 7.3 percent for 2012. JACKIE CALMES \n \n The $5 Trillion Tax Cut \n \n Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney repeatedly sparred over whether Mr. Romney has proposed a $5 trillion tax cut. \n \n It is true that Mr. Romney has proposed “revenue neutral” tax reform, meaning that he would not expand the deficit. However, he has proposed cutting all marginal tax rates by 20 percent — which would in and of itself cut tax revenue by $5 trillion. \n \n To make up that revenue, Mr. Romney has said he wants to clear out the underbrush of deductions and loopholes in the tax code. But he has not yet specified how he would do so. \n \n This week, in a television interview, Mr. Romney did shed some light — floating the idea of capping each household’s deductions at $17,000. \n \n “As an option, you could say everybody’s going to get up to a $17,000 deduction. And you could use your charitable deduction, your home mortgage deduction, or others, your health care deduction, and you can fill that bucket, if you will, that $17,000 bucket that way,” he said. “Higher-income people might have a lower number.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The deduction cap has the virtue of avoiding the tough negotiations over which tax expenditures to unwind. Many tax expenditures are highly popular, like the deduction for charitable giving. Moreover, many are important to the stability of the economy. Suddenly ending the home mortgage interest deduction, for instance, would threaten to destabilize the housing market. \n \n But a number of unanswered questions about Mr. Romney’s tax plan remain. \n \n For instance, Mr. Romney did not address how his proposed cap on deductions would affect tax credits. (Generally, deductions lower a family’s level of taxable income and credits erase part of their overall tax bill.) \n \n It is also unclear whether his proposal to cap deductions would raise enough revenue to pay for his income tax rate cuts — at least not without increasing the tax burden on families making less than $200,000 a year, which Mr. Romney has vowed that he will not do. ANNIE LOWREY \n \n Government ‘Takeover’ Of Health Care \n \n Mr. Romney said that Mr. Obama’s health care overhaul would allow the federal government to “take over health care,” an assertion rejected by the president. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But it also builds on the foundation of private health insurance, providing subsidies for millions of low- and moderate-income people to buy private insurance. \n \n Under the law, close to 30 million Americans are expected to gain health coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many of them would receive insurance through the expansion of Medicaid. The federal government will initially pay the entire cost of Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries and would never pay less than 90 percent. \n \n In addition, the federal government would subsidize the purchase of private insurance for millions of people with incomes up to four times the poverty level (up to $92,200 for a family of four). Private insurers would thus have many new customers. \n \n Projections by the nonpartisan office of the actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services show that federal, state and local government health spending will account for nearly 50 percent of all health spending in the United States by 2021, up from 46 percent in 2011. The federal share of all health spending is expected to rise to more than 31 percent, from slightly less than 29 percent. \n \n The changes reflect the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the new subsidies for private insurance, as well as the increase in Medicare enrollment as baby boomers join the program. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n When Mr. Romney and other Republicans complain of a federal takeover, they are referring to more than spending and enrollment in government health programs. They say the new health care law will require most Americans to purchase “government-approved insurance” or pay a new tax. The tax issue was at the heart of the Supreme Court’s much-debated 5-to-4 decision in June to uphold the president’s health care overhaul law, the Affordable Care Act. ROBERT PEAR \n \n Green Energy \n \n Mr. Romney said that half the companies backed by the president’s green energy stimulus program have gone out of business. That is a gross overstatement. Of nearly three dozen recipients of loans under the Department of Energy’s loan guarantee program, only three are currently in bankruptcy, although several others are facing financial difficulties. Mr. Romney also said that “many” of the companies that received such loans were supported by campaign contributors. George Kaiser, a major fund-raiser for Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign, was an investor in Solyndra, the failed solar panel maker, but there are also examples of Republican and Democratic campaign contributors who also invested in firms supported by the loan guarantee program. JOHN M. BRODER \n \n The $716 Billion Cut From Medicare \n \n Mr. Obama first brought up Mr. Romney’s frequent criticism that the president cut $716 billion from Medicare, by saying the cost savings were from reduced payments to insurance companies and other health care providers. But Mr. Romney repeated the claim, suggesting that the $716 billion in Medicare reductions would indeed come from current beneficiaries. \n \n While fact-checkers have repeatedly debunked this claim, it remains a standard attack line for Mr. Romney. \n \n The charge that Mr. Obama took $716 billion from Medicare recipients to pay for “Obamacare” has several problems — not least the fact that Mr. Romney’s running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, included the identical savings in his budget plans that House Republicans voted for in the past two years. \n \n Mr. Obama did not cut benefits by $716 billion over 10 years as part of his 2010 health care law; rather, he reduced Medicare reimbursements to health care providers, chiefly insurance companies and drug manufacturers. And the law gave Medicare recipients more generous benefits for prescription drugs and free preventive care like mammograms. \n \n According to nonpartisan analysts, it is Mr. Romney who would both cut benefits and add costs for beneficiaries if he restored the $716 billion in reductions. Restoring higher payments to insurers and other companies would in turn increase Medicare premiums because beneficiaries share in Medicare’s total cost. Marilyn Moon, a vice president at the American Institutes for Research, has calculated that a Medicare recipient’s out-of-pocket expenses would increase $577 a year on average by 2022. \n \n Also, the Obama reductions added eight years to the life of Medicare’s financially troubled trust fund, to 2024, according to Medicare trustees. If the cuts were restored, the insolvency date would revert to 2016. \n \n But the cuts to providers could cause private Medicare plans to raise their premiums, which is expected to reduce enrollment in them. Those changes have not materialized yet. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n JACKIE CALMES ||||| President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney threw a lot of facts and numbers at each other in Denver Wednesday night — details often so jarringly at odds that the two men seemed to be inhabiting two parallel universes. \n \n Here’s POLITICO’s guide to sorting through some of the edgiest claims, and what the independent experts off the stage have had to say about what the two candidates claimed: \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset 2012 First Presidential Debate in Denver POLITICO's 2012 Presidential Debate Post Game \n \n (See also: Complete coverage of 2012 presidential debates) \n \n The $5 Trillion Tax Cut \n \n Romney: “I’m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. … I won’t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That’s part one. So there’s no economist that can say Mitt Romney’s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. ... .I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.” \n \n Obama: “Governor Romney’s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut….For 18 months he’s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he’s saying that his big, bold idea is, ‘Never mind.’” \n \n (PHOTOS: Scenes from the Denver debate) \n \n Independent analysts say Romney’s numbers don’t add up. The rate cuts and other changes he’s proposing would indeed total almost $5 trillion over 10 years, and though he said Wednesday he’d pay for those cuts by reducing deductions and credits, a study by the Tax Policy Center found that it was “mathematically impossible” to cover the $5 trillion reduction by eliminating tax breaks solely on high-income taxpayers. \n \n In an interview earlier this week, Romney said he might cap deductions at $17,000. During the debate, he suggested such a cap might kick in at $25,000 or $50,000. However, it’s not clear how those limits would get around the problem the Tax Policy Center study noted. The Romney camp contends that study is biased and points to others with different results. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Romney’s 5 best debate lines) \n \n Romney acknowledged Wednesday that the bare numbers of his tax plan might not be revenue-neutral, but he said growth and new jobs created by his policies would generate added revenue to cover the gap. \n \n Simpson-Bowles \n \n Obama: “We’ve [taken the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan,] made some adjustments to it, and we’re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan.” \n \n Obama made the deficit-cutting plan he’s offered sound comparable to the plan from the chairmen of the Simpson-Bowles debt cutting commission. But it’s not: His proposal doesn’t save as much money as Simpson-Bowles and doesn’t offer the kinds of detailed entitlement cuts the panel’s leaders did. \n \n The president’s $4 trillion plan, including $3 trillion in spending cuts and $1 trillion in tax hikes from allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire, is spread over 10 years — a year longer than Simpson-Bowles. It sounds like a minor difference, but cuts and spending balloon in the so-called out years. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Obama’s 5 best debate lines) \n \n Also, Obama doesn’t touch Social Security in his plan. And the tax changes and war spending are accounted in ways that make Obama’s plan substantially less aggressive. \n \n “The president’s budget falls well short of the savings claimed by the [Simpson-Bowles] commission,” according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The committee, the kind of wonky group Obama loves to cite, said Obama’s plan provided only about two-thirds of the savings Simpson-Bowles proposed over a comparable period with comparable assumptions. ||||| Story highlights Obama says Trump is a small business under Romney plan \n \n The government defines small business as having under 500 workers \n \n President Barack Obama invoked Donald Trump's name during Wednesday's presidential debate, claiming that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney would consider the mogul's empire a small business. \n \n \"Under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses,\" President Obama said. \"Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.\" \n \n The facts: \n \n While there is no universally accepted definition of a small business, the federal government defines it as any business that employs fewer than 500 people. \n \n The Trump Organization employs 22,000 people. But Trump also runs a number of other companies that employ fewer than 500, meaning that -- under the federal government's definition -- he qualifies as a small business. \n \n According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, which uses the 500-worker maximum in its definition, such firms employ half of all private-sector workers and pay 44% of the total U.S. private payroll. In 2009, there were 27.5 million businesses in the nation, 99.7% of which were small firms. \n \n Photos: Photos: The first presidential debate Photos: Photos: The first presidential debate The first presidential debate – President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney finish their debate in Denver on Wednesday, October 3.

Of the top 400 people — who got $19.8 billion in S corporation and partnership net income in 2009 — 237 count as small businesses. \n \n An analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center finds that extending tax cuts for people who make more than $250,000 per year ($200,000 for single filers) would disproportionately help the richest taxpayers: 82% of the cut would go to people with more than $1 million in adjusted gross income, who would get an average tax cut of $164,000 apiece. \n \n Romney's plan does not single out small businesses for special treatment. His plan attempts to lower taxes on all businesses -- big or small. \n \n Conclusion: While Romney's plan does not define who is or is not a small business, some of Donald Trump's companies would qualify as a small business because they have fewer than 500 employees. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

The central theme revolves around fact-checking prominent statements made by both candidates on topics like the deficit, taxes, healthcare, and green energy.\n\nOne key point of contention involved Romney's assertion that Obama doubled the deficit. The article refutes this claim, stating that the deficit in Obama's final year was similar to the level when he took office, and even decreased as a percentage of the economy.\n\nAnother contentious issue was Romney's proposed \"revenue-neutral\" tax reform. While he intended to reduce marginal tax rates by 20% - which would inherently lead to a $5 trillion revenue loss -  he promised to compensate by eliminating deductions and loopholes. However, he did not provide specific details about how this would be achieved, leading to skepticism from analysts who questioned its feasibility.\n\nRegarding healthcare, Romney criticized Obama's Affordable Care Act as a \"government takeover.\" The article clarifies that the law expands the role of private insurance alongside government programs, citing projections that show a significant increase in the number of insured Americans through a combination of Medicaid expansion and subsidized private insurance.\n\nFurthermore, the article addresses Romney's claim that half the companies supported by Obama's green energy stimulus program failed. This claim is deemed a gross overstatement, as only three companies out of nearly three dozen recipients of loans from the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program had declared bankruptcy.\n\nRomney also criticized Obama for cutting $716 billion from Medicare. The article clarifies that these cuts were achieved through reduced payments to insurance companies and healthcare providers, not by directly reducing benefits for beneficiaries. It also points out that Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, had included identical savings in his own budget proposals.\n\nThe article concludes by examining Obama's statement that Romney would consider Donald Trump's business empire a \"small business\" under his definition. While Trump's The Trump Organization employs over 22,000 people, he also runs smaller companies that meet the federal definition of a small business, which is any company with fewer than 500 employees.\n\nThroughout the article, specific quotes by both candidates are used to illustrate their positions and the article cites data from sources like the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Tax Policy Center to support its analysis. \n\n\n\n"}

Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nbiochemically , obesity can be defined as a failure of the normal energy homeostasis mechanisms which are required to balance the intake and the expenditure of energy [ 1 , 2 ] .\nthe regulation of the size of fat stores is a complex process and involves both central and peripheral tissues [ 1 , 3 ] and over 50 secreted molecules , such as the adipocytic hormones leptin and adiponectin [ 4 , 5 ] , gastric ghrelin [ 6 , 7 ] , and intestinal cholecystokinin .\nmany of these molecules also play a role in various diseases associated with obesity , particularly , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) [ 7 , 9 ] .\nnonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) is a spectrum of diseases ranging from relatively benign fatty liver ( simple steatosis ) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , or nash , characterized by inflammation and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes , which may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis .\nnafld is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome affecting both adults and children [ 10 , 11 ] and is thought to reach a prevalence of up to 30% in the general population [ 1113 ] .\nthe association of nafld with obesity , particularly visceral obesity , has long been recognized .\nalthough a number of pathways , such as enhanced oxidative stress , increased susceptibility to apoptosis , and insulin resistance have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nafld , little is known about the triggers of the progression to nash , hepatic fibrosis , and ultimately cirrhosis .\nnot all individuals with nafld progress to cirrhosis . additionally , not all obese patients develop nash .\none explanation for this differential progression maybe the contribution of nonadipose peripheral tissues to the pathogenesis of obesity - related nafld . given that the stomach is one of the central organs of the digestive tract relaying satiety signals to the hypothalamus [ 14 , 15 ] and is a source of peptides with critical roles in energy homeostasis ( ghrelin )\n, its participation in the development of obesity related nafld or its progression looks plausible .\nthe discovery of ghrelin and its role in human metabolism has intensified the studies of hypothalamic control of the appetite and its contribution to obesity . in 2005\n, it was found that the ghrelin - encoding gene also encodes obestatin , which , unlike ghrelin , is involved in appetite suppression .\nin addition to ghrelin and obestatin , the stomach is the second largest source , after adipose tissue , of the appetite inhibiting peptide leptin [ 1820 ] .\nyet , studies on the role of gastric tissue in obesity - related disorders , such as nafld , are scarce . in our previous study\n, we showed that the serum levels for common stomach hormones are altered in patients with advanced stages of nafld .\nin particular , concentrations of des - acylghrelin in serum of patients with nash were increased twofold as compared to bmi - matched controls with simple steatosis , while concentrations of ghrelin and obestatin were increased in patients with advanced liver fibrosis .\nother studies showed that the levels of ghrelin are related to inflammation and reduce the severity of inflammation [ 21 , 22 ] .\nan overproduction of the ghrelin in the patients with advanced stages of chronic liver disease may be a compensatory event or a reflection of local inflammatory responses on site of their production .\nobservations listed above prompted us to hypothesize that the gastric tissue in obese subjects is actively contributing to the systemic inflammation and pathogenesis of one of the complications of obesity , nafld . to investigate this\n, we performed comparative expression profiling for 84 genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , their receptors and other components of inflammatory cascades in samples of gastric tissue removed during sleeve gastrectomy .\nthis study was approved by inova institutional review board ( federal assurance fwa00000573 ) . after informed consent , 20 morbidly\nother chronic liver diseases were excluded by negative serology for hepatitis b and c , no history of toxic exposure and no other cause of chronic liver disease . excessive alcohol consumption ( > 10 grams / day in women and > 20 grams / day in men ) was also excluded .\nno patients were receiving thiazolidinediones ( tzds ) or medications for gastritis , including proton pump inhibitors . from each patient , a discarded gastric tissue during sleeve gastrectomy was obtained and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen .\ngene expression profiling experiments were performed using fundic samples collected from the remaining sleeve gastrectomy specimens .\nsamples were profiled for expression levels of 84 genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , their receptors , and other components of inflammatory cascades using rt profiler pcr arrays ( qiagen , usa ) ( see supplementary table 1 in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/684237 ) . for each patient ,\na liver biopsy was performed and read by the hepatopathologist . before histopathological evaluation , each liver biopsy specimen was formalin -

x - c motif ) ligand 14 ( cxcl12 ) , and chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 1 ( ccl1 ) were also positively and significantly correlated with nash ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . in patients with hepatic fibrosis , only chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 17 ( ccl17 ) was significantly upregulated ( p  0.05 ) ( table 2 ) .\na different set of genes , small inducible cytokine subfamily e member 1 ( scye1 ) , il1rn , and complement component 5 ( c5 ) , however , were positively correlated with severity of fibrosis ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . to predict advanced hepatic inflammation ,\na single equation multivariate regression model was generated . in this model , only four variables  ccl21 , ccr5 , alt , and age acted as predictors of advanced inflammation , where ccl21\n( p < 0.0007 ) and ccr5 ( p < 0.0064 ) were the strongest predictors ( table 4 ) .\nthese four predictors explain 66% of the variance in the inflammation phenotype ( r = 0.66 ) . for understanding the effect of independent variables on pathogenesis of histologic nash , the multivariate regression generated a statistically significant model ( p < 0.002 ) with ccr3 , cxcl12 , il1rn , il8ra , il8rb , and interleukin 5 ( il5 ) .\nthis model explained 75% of the variance in nash phenotype ( r = 0.75 ) .\nthe model of advanced hepatic fibrosis ( p < 0.006 ) included only il1rn ( p < 0.006 ) as a sole component explaining 34% of the variance in fibrosis ( r = 0.34 ) .\ninterestingly , none of the genes showing differential regulation ( p  0.05 ) or significantly correlated with the degree of steatosis were able to contribute significantly to the model for steatosis ; hence , no models resulted from these analyses .\nhowever , it has limited capacity to store lipids . therefore , excess lipid buildup can result in the development of nafld .\none of the critical thrusts in the studies of the progression of nalfd has been the search for factors that may influence the progression of steatosis to nash and cirrhosis . according to the multiple hit model of nafld\n, many hits may act in parallel or in tandem contributing to this pathogenesis . of these , gut - derived and adipose tissue \ninflammation , a central player in the pathogenesis of nash , can enhance the probability of progression of fibrosis to nash - related cirrhosis .\nin the past decade , white adipose tissue has been considered as a major source for inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in obese patients [ 2931 ] .\nin addition to the adipose tissue , it was suggested that other tissues , particularly , gastric and intestinal tissues may overproduce various soluble molecules and contribute to overall inflammatory background influencing distant organs .\nour study is the first to show that mrnas encoding for various soluble molecules are overproduced in the gastric tissue of morbidly obese patients with advanced forms of nafld .\nremarkably , there was a substantial overlap in genes with significant differential expression ( p  0.05 ) and genes with significant correlation ( p  0.05 ) to the same histological characteristic of nafld ( supplementary figure 1 ) .\nfurther , distinct and notably , nonoverlapping sets of soluble molecule encoding genes change their expression along with various histological features of nafld ( figure 1 ) .\nimportantly , an overlap between sets of genes significantly correlating ( p  0.05 ) with a specific histological characteristic of nafld was minimal ( figure 1 ) .\nil8rb / cxcr2 is a notable exclusion with its overexpression correlating with steatosis and diagnosis of nash as well as fibrosis .\nil8rb / cxcr2 is a receptor for the il8 chemokine that plays an important role in liver inflammation , regeneration , and repair [ 32 , 33 ] as well as in the neutrophil accumulation in other inflammatory conditions [ 31 , 34 ]\n. increased levels of the gastric expression of il8rb gene indicate that in morbidly obese patients with nash - associated inflammation , il8 activation is not limited to hepatic macrophages as had been shown before , but is a system - wide feature .\nit is plausible that il8rb present on the resident gastric macrophages cells or on neutrophils activates the neutrophils locally upon its binding to il8 . in turn\n, activated neutrophils may then release additional chemokines and/or may enter the liver through portal circulation and influence the progression of nafld ( figure 2 ) .\nthis premise is also supported by our observation that the expression of il8 gene that encodes the ligand for il8rb positively correlates with advanced hepatic inflammation ( table 3 ) .\ncirculatory il8 levels are reported to increase under oxidative stress and , in turn , stimulate further increase in levels of oxidant stress mediators by local recruitment of inflammatory cells   ( figure 2 ) . as an expanding adipose tissue of obese individuals releases increased levels of il8 [ 9 , 30 ] , it may trigger increased expression of gastric il8 and its receptor il8rb .\nadditionally , studies have shown that free fatty acids ( ffa ) , also increased in obese individuals , influence expression of il8 in various peripheral tissues [ 36 , 37 ] .\nthus , the paired increase in levels of il8 and its receptor found in the gastric tissue of obese may act to activate local as well as circulating , thus contributing towards vicious cycle of inflammation and influencing progression of nafld .\nthe expression levels of anti - inflammatory receptor il1rn , an antagonist of il1a and il1b , were positively correlated both with the presence of nash and with fibrosis ( table 3 ) . in the regression model predicting fibrosis , expression of il1rn mrna was the only significant component that explained 34% of the variance in fibrosis .\nadditionally , il1rn mrna expression significantly contributed to the regression model predicting nash ( table 4 ) .\nthese observations are in agreement with a recent report on association of serum il1ra levels and liver il1rn expression with nash .\nil1ra is expressed and secreted by a number of immune cells such as monocytes , macrophages , and neutrophils as well as epithelial cells and hepatocytes . as its expression\nis regulated by proinflammatory cytokines , il1rn is considered to be an acute phase protein   with levels elevated in many inflammatory conditions .\nwe hypothesize that increased levels of circulating and/or local proinflammatory cytokines upregulate gastric il1rn expression either directly or via activated leukocytes ( figure 2 ) .\nonce upregulated , il1ra may stimulate its own gastric expression by a positive feedback loop ( figure 2 ) .\nthis mechanism is supported by studies showing elevated circulating il1rn in patients with obesity   and nafld [ 38 , 42 ] .\nmany genes differentially expressed in the gastric tissue of patients with advanced forms of nafld encode chemokines previously shown as important players in a variety of inflammatory conditions . for example\n, expression levels of both ccl4 chemokine and its receptor ccr5 encoding genes showed significant upregulation in advanced hepatic inflammation ( table 2 ) and a positive correlation with the severity of the hepatic inflammation ( p  0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . in the multivariate regression model ,\nccr5 mrna level also was one of the strongest predictors of the severity of hepatic inflammation ( table 4 ) .\nccl4 attracts natural killer cells , monocytes , and a variety of other immune cells .\nthe increased expression of ccl4 and ccr5 genes in gastric tissue could be attributed to local immune cells activated in response to upstream regulators like il1f8 ( figure 2 ) . in the present study\n, il1f8 gene was also upregulated in stomach tissue of patients with advanced liver inflammation ( tables 2 and 5 ) .\nwhile the role of ccl4/ccr5 in the pathogenesis of nafld remains to be sketched out , these collective findings make it an attractive target for further investigation .\nthe complex interaction of cytokines , chemokines , and their receptors highlighted in this study suggests that the gastric tissue is an integral player in obesity - associated nafld .\nit seems that in obesity , an increase in inflammatory responses of adipose tissue corresponds to similar increase in the inflammation within the tissues involved in satiety response .\nactivated immune cells embedded in the gastric tissue may then recruit additional immune cells or be released in circulation , and hence amplify the inflammatory response and promote the development and progression of nafld ( figure 2 ) . an increase in recognition of the endocrine function of the stomach and its contributions to energy homeostasis\nthis , in turn , may trigger a cascade of metabolic dysfunction culminating in nafld ( figure 2 ) .\nit remains to be determined if the complex interaction of inflammatory molecules in gastric tissue lies upstream or downstream of the intricate network of inflammatory signaling , which is the hallmark of nafld .\nevidently , the stomach plays a certain role in metabolic dysfunction ; its potential proinflammatory properties should not be neglected by studies of the conditions related to metabolic syndromes , including nafld .\nin this study , we demonstrate an altered pattern of gene expression for cytokine and chemokine encoding genes in the gastric tissue of individuals with obesity and varying degrees of hepatic inflammation and different forms of nafld .\nsoluble inflammatory molecules produced by the stomach appear to contribute to obesity - related nafld .\nalthough the causal links between these signaling events remains to be determined , we propose that the fundus of the stomach is an integral player in the signaling milieu associated with both obesity -

", "response": "\n\nThis study investigates the role of gastric tissue in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in obese individuals. The researchers hypothesize that gastric tissue, known for its role in satiety signaling, may actively contribute to the systemic inflammation associated with NAFLD.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the researchers performed a comparative gene expression analysis of 84 genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and related molecules in gastric tissue samples from morbidly obese patients with varying degrees of NAFLD severity. These patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy, and fundic gastric tissue samples were collected. Liver biopsies were also obtained to assess the extent of NAFLD.\n\nThe study revealed significant differences in gene expression patterns between patients with advanced NAFLD and those with milder forms.  \n\nSpecifically:\n\n* **Advanced hepatic inflammation:** Increased expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4), chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 6 (CXCL6), interferon alpha 2 (IFNA2), interleukin 19 (IL19), interleukin 1 family member 8 (IL1F8), and interleukin 8 (IL8) was observed.\n* **Advanced steatosis:** Increased expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14), interleukin 1 family member 10 (IL1F10), and interleukin 8 receptor  (IL8RB) was found.\n* **Histologic NASH:** Differentially expressed genes included chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 3 (CCR3), chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 9 (CCR9), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), interleukin 8 receptor A (IL8RA), and interleukin 9 (IL9).\n* **Hepatic fibrosis:** Only chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17) was significantly upregulated.\n\nThe researchers also identified correlations between specific gene expression levels and NAFLD characteristics. Notably, IL8RB expression correlated with steatosis, NASH, and fibrosis.\n\nUsing multivariate regression analysis, the study identified key predictors for advanced hepatic inflammation, NASH, and fibrosis. For example, CCL21 and CCR5 were strong predictors of advanced inflammation, while IL1RN was a significant predictor of fibrosis.\n\nThese findings suggest that gastric tissue actively contributes to the inflammatory milieu in NAFLD through the production of various cytokines and chemokines. This contribution may play a significant role in the progression of NAFLD from simple steatosis to more severe forms like NASH and fibrosis.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of considering the role of extrahepatic tissues, such as the stomach, in understanding the complex pathogenesis of NAFLD. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the causal relationships between gastric inflammation and NAFLD progression.\n"}

{"id": "summarization_021", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nBy turns warmly sentimental, serial-killer sinister and science-fiction fantastical, \"The Lovely Bones\" was an unlikely book to achieve worldwide success. In the film version, those mismatched elements come back to haunt the story, so to speak, making the final product more hit-and-miss than unblemished triumph.It wasn't only the bestselling nature of Alice Sebold's novel that made \"Bones\" one of the most anticipated films of the year. It was the participation of director Peter Jackson and his regular screenwriting collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, the team that had a considerable triumph with the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.And Jackson is successful re-creating parts of this story told by a 14-year-old girl who is savagely murdered in 1973 and then watches for years from a kind of in-between state that she calls \"the blue horizon between heaven and earth\" as her friends, her family and her killer go on about their lives.His best move by far was casting young Irish actress Saoirse Ronan , Oscar-nominated for her compelling role in \" Atonement,\" as the murdered Susie Salmon. An enormously gifted performer, Ronan is the only element of the film that is exactly as it should be, bringing naturalness, honesty and radiance to the part of a young woman just on the cusp of life.Other elements, including \"The Lovely Bones' \" imaginative notion of what Susie's afterlife looks like, are strong, but everything that's good is undermined by an overemphasis on one part of the story that is essential but has been allowed to overflow its boundaries.That would be the film's decision to foreground its weirdest, creepiest, most shocking elements, starting with the decision to give a much more prominent role to murderer George Harvey. Expertly played by Stanley Tucci, so transformed by makeup as to be almost unrecognizable, Harvey is such an unsettling, toxic individual that the actor says he came close to turning down the role.It's not only Harvey that we see in sometimes grotesque detail, it's the bizarre decorations of the underground murder site that we watch him ever so carefully plan and build, as well as the realistic bodies of his previous victims. And there is of course the chilling time the family spends trying to solve Susie's murder.Though it's unfortunate, this focus will not be a shock to those who know Jackson's films. The director (visible in an amusing cameo examining a movie camera in a shopping mall) began his career with a fondness for splatter-type material with titles like \"Bad Taste\" and \"Braindead.\" It may even be that the chance to fool around with this kind of stuff on a more high-tone level was one thing that drew the filmmaker to the novel in the first place.But though it can be argued that these things, or versions of them, are key points in the novel, seeing them on the screen plays differently, disturbing the story's balance. If Sebold's ultimately soothing novel had focused this much on its off-putting aspects, it never would have found the huge audience it did.Because the book was such a major success, \"The Lovely Bones\" pretty much had its choice of actors for key roles, and in selecting two strong performers, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, as Susie's father, Jack, and mother, Abigail, both devastated in their own ways by their daughter's death, the film undeniably chose well.But though both actors have their moments, the film's erratic mixture of emotional tones, its decision to go back and forth from missing-Susie sadness to serial-killer sadism, undercuts their ability to give resonant performances.Also hamstrung, but for a different reason, is Susan Sarandon as Grandma Lynn, who's been encouraged to be too over the top for anyone's good.One element of the film that is consistently involving is the dreamscape look of the in-between world where Susie spends her time watching her murderer scheme, her sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) grow up and her parents fall apart. A field of barley that changes into a rolling ocean, huge versions of the ships-in-a-bottle that were her father's hobby, roses blooming under frozen lakes, they all speak to a world, created by New Zealand's Weta Digital and beautifully shot by cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, that is particular to Susie but special to us all.Though \"The Lovely Bones\" never overcomes its tendency to push things too hard, there are moments, almost invariably involving star Ronan, that resonate with the book's comforting notion of a sentient afterlife. To hear Susie speak the novel's signature lines about \"the lovely bones that had grown around my absence\" as she comes to terms with \"the world without me in it\" is to feel what we've been wanting to feel for a long time. It's also to wish that the entire film were as effective as these best moments, but that was not to be. ||||| Matt Mueller \n \n Directed by Peter Jackson \n \n With Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz \n \n Opens Dec. 11 \n \n Jack Salmon (Mark Wahlberg) is a family man and a hobbyist; he adores his wife and kids, especially Susie (Saoirse Ronan), his eldest; he also loves to build miniature ships and deftly slip them into bottles. \"If you start something,\" he tells Susie as he's completing one model, \"you don't give up till you've finished it.\" He glances up, seemingly referring to the ship but staring right at Susie, and adds, \"That is a thing of beauty.\" \n \n At that sweet moment, Jack doesn't realize he won't have much longer to stare proudly at her. Across the pleasant suburban street in Norristown, Pa., another man, George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), is busy with his own hobbies. He has constructed a dollhouse, pristine and perfectly appointed but untenanted. And in a nearby cornfield, he's created an underground rec room, filled with comic books and figurines and Cokes  a kind of clubhouse where he'd like to bring the local kids. One kid. Susie. (See the top 10 fiction books of 2009.) \n \n \"I was 14 years old when I was murdered, on Dec. 6, 1973,\" Susie narrates in this creepy, dreamy film of Alice Sebold's best seller, directed and co-written by The Lord of the Rings' Peter Jackson. The girl, who vanished late one afternoon and is presumed to have been kidnapped or killed, speaks to us from the in-between  a mostly Edenic halfway house for the recently deceased, a bridge between life and a hoped-for heaven. It's a fantasyland of penguin topiary and gigantic ice-sculpture ships, where fields turn into soggy marshes and autumn becomes winter in a flash of fallen leaves. This engrossing, nearly enthralling movie straddles multiple worlds as well: Susie's bright innocence, Mr. Harvey's meticulous depravity and Jack's ferocious determination to sleuth his daughter's fate. \n \n Like Susie's father and her murderer, Jackson builds models  the foam-rubber puppets of his early Meet the Feebles, the exponentially more complicated imaginary realms of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong  and invites children of all ages to share his obsessions. A director wants to trap life on film, and the prime visual motif of The Lovely Bones is things in artificial enclosures: a penguin in a snow globe, a ship in a bottle, the furniture in a dollhouse, a girl underground, a dead girl in between, some lovely bones in a heavy safe. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) \n \n But a director's true gift is to animate these figures, bring them to life. Jackson goes further: he keeps Susie alive after she's died. He's not going for gross-out effects here. He shows Susie's attempt to escape from Mr. Harvey's bunker but not her death. And though the film follows Mr. Harvey as he disposes of Susie's remains, it concentrates on the victim and her loved ones: Jack, his wife Abigail (Rachel Weisz) and their surviving daughter Lindsey (the appealing Rose McIver, who plays Summer Landsdown on the ABC kids' series Power Rangers RPM). She could be Mr. Harvey's unmasker  or his next victim. \n \n The New Zealand director began his career with horror movies. His well-named debut feature Bad Taste had aliens seeking human flesh for their outer-space fast-food chain, and Braindead (a.k.a. Dead Alive) was a Sumatran-rat-plague movie about mother love gone spectacularly wrong. The Lovely Bones has elements of some of those mulchy horror films, and another, classic one  this could be Psycho as told by the murdered Janet Leigh character. (Norman Bates had a hobby too: taxidermy.) Jackson also allows a strong echo of his 1994 Heavenly Creatures, a terrific, fact-based study of a girlhood crush that blossoms into murder, which pulled precocious performances from two teen beguilers, Melanie Lynskey and the pre-Titanic Kate Winslet. But essentially, the new film is a story of loving and mourning and loving some more. As Susie says of Mr. Harvey, \"He didn't understand how much a father could love his child.\" (See the top 10 movie performances of 2009.) \n \n The plot has a few pitfalls. Jack, who fingers dozens of Norristown men as Susie's potential abductor, takes ages to notice the strange guy across the street. Abigail, who departs and reappears with little organic reason, is irrelevant to the central daddy-daughter bond. Abigail's mother Lynn (Susan Sarandon) is around only as blowsy comic relief. But she does have one great line: to Abigail, who refuses to change anything in Susie's bedroom, Lynn says, \"You have a tomb in the middle of your house!\" In a way, that's true of all the Salmons. With Susie gone, they have a tumor in their collective heart. \n \n The movie is packed with privileged moments. A few are grimly comic, like the interior decoration of Mr. Harvey's subterranean playroom; his choices of teen artifacts are both pathetically out of date and a window into a life of outsider lunacy. And some moments have the most poignant tang. From the in-between, Susie has a glimpse of Lindsey's first kiss  an ecstasy Susie was so close to experiencing before she entered Mr. Harvey's lair, that she hopes she can feel for real before she goes to heaven. (Read a book review of The Lovely Bones.) \n \n Tucci plays the killer not with a madman's sneers and cackles but with a quiet malevolence; he's never more ice-shivery than when he's pretending to be normal. Such a performance could have upset the movie's balance if Wahlberg hadn't provided the solid foundation of parental devotion. The center, of course, is Ronan, the Irish teen best remembered as the girl whose lie set lives tumbling in Atonement. As the dead girl hovering over her family like a guardian angel, Ronan makes Susie seem an ordinary child whom catastrophe has made otherworldly-wise. Through Jackson's art and Ronan's magic, the obscenity of child murder has been invested with immense gravity and grace. Like the story of Susie's life after death, that's a miracle. \n \n This is an expanded version of the review that ran in the Dec. 7 issue of TIME magazine. \n \n See the latest news about movies at Techland.com. \n \n See pictures of crime in Middle America. \n \n Next Invictus ||||| A dead 14-year-old girl named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), murdered on her way home from school in 1973, tells her story from heaven in The Lovely Bones. In doing so, Susie follows the narrative path set for her in the striking 2002 novel by Alice Sebold on which this much-awaited adaptation by Peter Jackson is based. But as directed by the lord of The Lord of the Rings from a screenplay by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, his bleached Bones bears little resemblance to the book in either tone or complexity. Readers will be frustrated; newcomers to the story may wonder why what is now essentially a serial-killer thriller includes so many scenes of a heaven that looks like a gumdrop-colored hobbit shire, a magical place of fanciful special effects. \n \n In Jackson's simplified, sweetened, and CGI-besotted telling, The Lovely Bones is a sad-but-hopeful, dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens. (There's no indication that Susie gets raped, as she does in the novel, and her murder occurs off screen.) Atonement's terrific Ronan, with her astonishing glacier-blue eyes, watches from a scenic afterlife as her father (Mark Wahlberg), mother (Rachel Weisz), younger siblings, and selected friends simultaneously heal from their loss and search for her killer. For comic relief, the family's boozy granny (Susan Sarandon) arrives, swathed in mink. Apparently participating in a burlesque movie, Sarandon camps it up, demonstrating terrible housekeeping skills and wreaking grande-dame havoc. \n \n As for the killer, he's in plain sight from the beginning  a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci) with the hopeless comb-over and furtive mustache of an easy-to-spot perv. Tucci is jolting in the role, honestly unsettling as he maintains an exterior of mildness that masks a grotesque interior. Electrifying danger accompanies his every scene. But this in itself becomes a problem, as that same energy leaves the screen when he does. Jackson reduces his Lovely Bones, in the end, to the dramatic contrast between the menace of a hateful killer (will he be caught?) and the grief of a loving father (can he avenge his daughter's death?). Sebold's Lovely Bones, on the other hand, is fleshed out with the perilous, irresistible power of sex  the author acknowledges a real world of extramarital sex and sex between young lovers in addition to the heinous rape from which moviegoers are shielded. The filmmaker handled the sexual power of girls beautifully in 1994's Heavenly Creatures. But here he shies from the challenge, shortchanging a story that isn't only about the lightness of souls in heaven but also about the urges of bodies on earth. Jackson forfeits depth for safe, surface loveliness.

TRAILER: Get a taste of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the bestselling book Alice Sebold's best-selling The Lovely Bones falls into that category. The novel, told from the perspective of a murdered 14-year-old girl, is chilling and poetic. It can't have been easy to adapt because of its reliance on the musings of a dead, omniscient narrator. But a device that works on the page comes off artificial and emotionless on-screen. The movie strikes clashing tones, veering from lightheartedness to heavy-handedness. It's hard not to have high expectations of director Peter Jackson after TheLord of the Rings. And given his haunting Heavenly Creatures (1994), about teenagers and murder, he would seem the right filmmaker to adapt this book. But the scenes that take place in an alternate universe — a way station between heaven and Earth — are jarring. Depicting heaven has long stymied directors, and Jackson's cheesy computer-generated world breaks no ground. Saoirse Ronan (Atonement) is well-cast as the wide-eyed Susie Salmon, who has a passion for photography, loving parents (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz) and a crush on a high school senior (Reese Ritchie). Walking home from school, Susie is lured into an underground lair by the nebbishy George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Tucci gives a nightmare-inducing performance as the neighbor whose pleasantries are almost as scary as his violent predilections. Jackson gets the thriller scenes right. He sets up a tense sequence in which a detective (Michael Imperioli) and Harvey eye each other through the windows of a dollhouse. Susie's sister, Lindsey (Rose McIver), is suspicious and sneaks into Harvey's house to find evidence in a suspenseful episode. But the conceit of Susie trapped in a DayGlo world between the one she left and her final resting place, imparting lessons on coping with death, feels preachy. It's more moving when she utters simply: \"I was here for a moment, and then I was gone.\" Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

And I'll try and draw my favourite animal .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No ,\nUser Interface: I'll {disfmarker} I should leave that one on there\nIndustrial Designer: you can erase the turtle ,\nUser Interface: shouldn't I {vocalsound} before I callously rub it off .\nIndustrial Designer: it's alright .\nProject Manager: Might be nice to have them all up there at same time .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Is that at least identifiable ?\nIndustrial Designer: Snake .\nMarketing: Well .\nProject Manager: Em\nIndustrial Designer: Well ,\nUser Interface: It's a whale {vocalsound} , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: snake ? {vocalsound} It's w {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nMarketing: Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're {disfmarker} well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals .\nMarketing: Take my contraptions with me . Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , {gap} animal . Don't really know how to draw this . Just where can I {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . Maybe if I do the water ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but how ? Sort of give an idea . {vocalsound} I have no idea how one would explain this . Mm maybe with some whiskers . Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay . Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , {vocalsound} from California . Um . Hmm . {vocalsound} S {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh ,\nMarketing: It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .\nIndustrial Designer: a cat .\nProject Manager: Um it's actually a coyote .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Let's see . Let's see ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That's impressive .\nProject Manager: let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth .\nIndustrial Designer: That's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: That's pretty impressive .\nUser Interface: Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Oh dear . {vocalsound} Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . We have coyotes howl all the time . So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm . {vocalsound} Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple {vocalsound} we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such {disfmarker} this is for television it's a {disfmarker} we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could {disfmarker} I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you {disfmarker} what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I just wanna watch the T_V_ {vocalsound} um .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Always gets lost . Some sort of like device to help you find it .\nUser Interface: I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . I find them {disfmarker} they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of {disfmarker} in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah um . I agree with having too many remotes around . My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um . What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I think there is a way around that ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's {disfmarker} if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Um I would imagine all of them ,\nIndustrial Designer: I know .\nProject Manager: but we could {disfmarker} but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , something that doesn't {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . So how do we work with that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Could we get something that just has {disfmarker} No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for {disfmarker} that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: channel changing .\nMarketing: And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the {disfmarker} whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: N that way {disfmarker} Yeah .\nMarketing: 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .\nIndustrial Designer: Um .\nProject Manager: Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So like you have to have them somewhere ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good question .\nUser Interface: um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I don't know that yet .\nUser Interface: Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: It's a good question . Um . {vocalsound} I'll look into that .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm hmm .\nProject Manager: If I can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it {disfmarker} if we're taking it just {gap} new product a new television remote control that's not like {vocalsound} doesn't say .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah .\nMarketing: You know , things might be more advanced than that . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So we should {disfmarker} maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have {vocalsound} playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . If it's just a television then that {disfmarker} it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It's an idea with the buttons being really {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: Large . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . Mind if we move on ? Ps\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: mm okay .\nUser Interface: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um the User Interface Designer , that's for {gap} . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . Um so very exited to see all your animals and how {disfmarker} what wonderful um artists we all are {vocalsound} um .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Any questions ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? Do we know that ?\nProject Manager: I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction\nUser Interface: Right .\nProject Manager: and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time\nUser Interface: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nUser Interface: Yep .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm sure we'll be busy .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um .\nUser Interface: Okay . Can you e-mail your slides as well ? Is that possible ?\nProject Manager: Yes , I yes , I think I can . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Cool\nProject Manager: I'll just attach it to an email . And you're you're number two ,\nIndustrial Designer: I'm two .\nProject Manager: three , four ?\nMarketing: I'm four .\nProject Manager: Is that correct ? Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Excellent . It was lovely meeting you all .\nUser Interface: 'Kay\nProject Manager: Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Let me see if I can do that right now . \n[Text End]\n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_023", "instruction": "You're a professional researcher. Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nthe shape of clusters in percolation type models is an interesting physical property . numerical simulations on random models\nhas revealed that percolation clusters at the percolation threshold are asymmetric  @xcite which is a significant result , especially because of the close connection between percolation model and the theory of second - order phase transition  @xcite\n.    generally speaking , the shape of a 2-dimensional cluster is determined by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , the eigenvalues ( the principal radii of gyration ) of the cluster radius of gyration tensor . if @xmath3 , the cluster is spherically symmetric .\notherwise , it is anisotropic and we can probe the degree of its anisotropy by defining a proper anisotropy quantifier .\nfamily et al  @xcite , proposed an convenient asymmetry measure , @xmath4 , called the anisotropy parameter of a @xmath5-site cluster .\nthe quantity @xmath6 when properly averaged over all clusters with the same size is denoted by @xmath7 and is an estimate of the anisotropy parameter of @xmath5-site clusters in the ensemble .\nthe case @xmath8 , corresponds to spherical symmetry . for anisotropic objects , @xmath9 is less than unity ( the term anisotropy parameter may be misleading ; the shape of the cluster is more isotropic for larger value of @xmath6 ) .\nthe asymptotic behaviour of @xmath10 is obtained by taking the limit @xmath11 . using this method for two dimensional random percolation , they observed for the first time that percolation clusters are not isotropic and estimated @xmath12 as the asymptotic value for the anisotropy of infinitely large percolation clusters .\nthe most studied percolation systems have been involved with totally random and un - correlated models .\nbut , in some important practical applications of percolation theory , the nature of disorder is not completely random and there are correlations in the properties of the medium .\nfor example , percolation theory has been used to understanding and explaining some important aspects of multi - phase flow in porous media  @xcite .\nhowever , studies have demonstrated the existence of long - rang correlations in the permeability distributions and porosity logs of some field scale natural porous media like sedimentary rocks  @xcite .\na common way of introducing long - range correlations into a medium property is fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xmath13\nfbm is an ergodic , non - stationary stochastic process whose increments are statistically self - similar such that its mean square fluctuation is proportional to an arbitrary power of the spatial displacement @xmath14    @xmath15 ^ 2\\rangle \\sim |\\overrightarrow{x}|^{2h}\\ ] ]    @xmath16 is called the hurst exponent and determines the type of correlations . if @xmath17 , the above equation produces the ordinary brownian motion , which means that in this case there is no correlation between different increments .\nif @xmath18 , then fbm generates positive correlations , i.e. all the points in a neighborhood of a given point obey more or less the same trend .\nif @xmath19 , fbm is anti - persistence , i.e. a trend at a point will not be likely followed in its immediate neighborhood .    in this paper\nwe address the shape of 2-d percolation clusters of self - affine models by evaluating their anisotropy parameters.the reason that we have chosen fbm process is tenfold .\nfirst , fbm generates long - range and at the same time isotropic correlations in the field .\ntherefore , the host lattice retains its isotropy .\nsecond it has been demonstrated that such process has practical applications in earth sciences and also reservoir engineering , where the permeability field and also the porosity distribution of many real oil reservoirs and aquifer follow fbm statistic  @xcite . a fib has been used by schmittbuhl et al  @xcite and sahimi  @xcite for generating a percolation model with long - range correlations .\nthe paper is organized as follow . after describing the simulation method in section 2 , we present and discuss the results of our extensive numerical simulations of percolation processes for both random and self affine models in section 3 , with concluding remarks at section 4 .\nwe start with a @xmath20 square lattice , and assign to each lattice site @xmath21 a random number drawn from a normalized fbm distribution .\nthere are a number of methods which are capable of producing the fbm statistics  @xcite .\nwe have used one of the most popular one , the method of fast fourier transformation ( fft ) filtering which is based on the fact that the power spectrum of fbm is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a numerical constant , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the forger component in the @xmath26th direction and @xmath27 . in the fat method ,\none starts with a white noise @xmath28 defined on the lattice sites .\nthe power spectrum of @xmath28 is constant and independent of frequency .\ntherefore , filtering @xmath28 with a transfer function @xmath29 generates another noise whose spectral density is proportional to @xmath30 .\nthe method is straightforward and fast , but it usually produces periodic noises .\ntherefore , one has to produce a larger lattice and keep only a portion ( typically 1/4 in two - dimensional lattices ) . in fig.1 two different realizations of fib on a @xmath31 square lattice have been shown .    to generate percolation clusters\none chooses a threshold @xmath32 .\nall lattice sites whose @xmath33 values are less than @xmath32 are considered filled .\nthe concentration @xmath34 of filled sites depends on both @xmath35 and @xmath32 through : @xmath36    the percolation threshold @xmath37 has been defined as the minimum concentration @xmath34 of filled sites to form an infinite cluster with probability @xmath38 .\nit has been observed that percolation transitions on long - range self - affine structures behaves differently from ordinary percolation in some important aspects  @xcite .\nfor example , marrink et al  @xcite found that percolation thresholds @xmath37 of self - affine lattices are strongly dependent on the spanning rule employed even when the lattice is effectively infinite . following the work of reynolds et al  @xcite on un - correlated square lattices , they considered three different spanning rules for percolation on self - affine models , @xmath39 , the probability of spanning either horizontally or vertically or both , @xmath40 , the probability of spanning in a specified direction ( e.g. horizontally ) , and @xmath41 , the probability of spanning both horizontally and vertically .\nthe numerical results obtained by marrink et al established that unlike the urn - correlated random model three critical concentrations : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ( corresponding to percolation rules @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath41 respectively ) do not converge for infinite self - affine models .\ntherefore , the definition of the percolation threshold depends on the desired applications and one must consider the appropriate percolation threshold to obtain critical parameters of percolation transition of self affine models .    at each specified percolation threshold\n, there exists a distribution of distinct , finite clusters ( equilibrium percolation clusters ) . in this work we made the search for clusters by using the hoshen - kopelman algorithm  @xcite . to remove the effect of boundary conditions from our numerical estimations , we only count those clusters which do not touch lattice boundaries .\nwe call them internal clusters . for each internal cluster of an arbitrary size @xmath5 , we evaluate the cluster radius of gyration tensor @xmath47 @xmath48 in the above definition , @xmath49 is the distance of occupied site @xmath26 from the cluster s center of mass and @xmath5 is the size of the cluster .\nthe principal radii of gyration of the cluster , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are obtained via diagonalization of @xmath47 . at the percolation threshold\nthe variations in the @xmath52 , have the following asymptotic form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the leading scaling exponent and @xmath55 is the non - analytical correction - to - scaling exponent of the cluster .\nthe coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are all independent of @xmath5  @xcite .\nthe shape of the cluster is then characterized by evaluating its anisotropy parameter , as described previously .\nfinally , we obtain the mean values of anisotropy quantifier by averaging it over all the percolation clusters with the same size @xmath5 , resulted in different lattice realizations .\nthen , the results have been lumped together at the centers of blocks of size @xmath59 $ ] .\nthis procedure not only helps to eliminate correction - to - scaling for small clusters  @xcite , but it produces new data points which are usually less correlated than the original data  @xcite .\nthe most time - consuming step in these kind of simulations is generation of fbm statistics itself .\ngenerating fbm on large lattices requires significant cpu time and computer memory . on the other hand , in order to eliminate finite - size effects from numerical results , we need lattices with large @xmath60 . in this work ,\nwe have fixed the linear size of our square lattices to @xmath61 which is both computationally tractable and at the same time large enough to make sure that our results are not affected by finite - size effects  @xcite . to achieve highly accurate results\n, we estimate the mean values by sampling a large number of lattice realizations ( @xmath62 samples in each case ) .    in order to make an appropriate and reliable sampling of cluster shapes in configurations space\nit is necessary that the medium linear size be large enough such that all possible configurations , including the most anisotropic ones potentially can happen ( the condition of effectively infinite large medium ) .\nthis puts a maximum on cluster size @xmath5 . indeed , for large clusters , i.e. when @xmath63 , the condition of effectively infinite large medium would not be fulfilled and as such\n, the sampling would be in favor of more isotropic configurations .\nlet us first look at the shape of percolation clusters in completely random media .\nas mentioned in the first section , the estimated value of @xmath64 at percolation threshold has been reported by several authors . here\n, we provide our estimations of the anisotropy parameters of percolation clusters for some selected values of @xmath34 in table1 .\nthe total number of lattice realizations has been @xmath65 in this case .\nthe cluster numbers is a function of @xmath34 , but it always decreases rapidly with @xmath5  @xcite .\ntherefore , when @xmath66 is not small , the total number of clusters of larger sizes is not large enough to give a reliable statistics and we do not include the anisotropy parameters of such clusters in our reports .\n.the anisotropy parameters of random model    lllllllll @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath68 & @xmath70 & @xmath68 & @xmath71 & @xmath68 & @xmath72 +   + @xmath73 & @xmath68 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath68 & @xmath77 & @xmath68 & @xmath78 + @xmath79 & @xmath68 & @xmath80 & @xmath75 & @xmath81 & @xmath68 & @xmath82 & @xmath68 & @xmath83 + @xmath84 & @xmath68 & @xmath85 & @xmath75 & @xmath86 & @xmath68 & @xmath87 & @xmath68 & @xmath88 + @xmath89 & @xmath68 & @xmath90 & @xmath75 & @xmath91 & @xmath68 & @xmath92 & @xmath68 & @xmath93 + @xmath94 & @xmath68 & @xmath95 & @xmath75 & @xmath96 & @xmath68 & @xmath97 & @xmath68 & @xmath98 + @xmath99 & @xmath68 & @xmath100 & @xmath75 & @xmath101 & @xmath68 & @xmath102 & @xmath68 & @xmath103 + @xmath104 & @xmath68 & @xmath105 & @xmath75 & @xmath106 & @xmath68 & @xmath107 & @xmath68 & @xmath108 +   +    as seen from this results , in ordinary percolation the cluster mean anisotropy parameters is a function of both @xmath34 and @xmath5 .\nthis is natural as the number of a specific cluster configuration in random percolation model is proportional to @xmath109 , where @xmath5 is the cluster size and @xmath110 is its perimeter  @xcite .\nin fact more careful investigations show some important trends in the behaviour of @xmath111 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath34 .\nfor example , looking at the table we can see that all the values of @xmath5 , the mean anisotropy parameter grows with @xmath34 .\nmeanwhile , the variation of @xmath112 for a given @xmath34 is much more complicated .\nit seems that for @xmath113 , @xmath7 has a maximum at some moderate value of @xmath5 , while when @xmath114 , the larger clusters are always more symmetric than smaller ones .\nthe behaviour of @xmath9 at percolation threshold @xmath115 is consistent with equation2 , i.e. , it evolves to an asymptotic value at large values of @xmath5  @xcite .    to produce the percolation clusters of the self - affine model we have used the percolation thresholds provided in ref .\n[ 16 ] . in fig.2\nwe have shown our estimations of the concentrations @xmath34 of filled sites as a function of cutoff @xmath32 for three different values of hurts exponent , @xmath116 , @xmath17 and @xmath117 . for random model , @xmath118 , but as it is seen this is not the case for self - affine models .\nin fact , the fraction of occupied sites at both @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in self - affine models is less than the corresponding values of random model .\nthis is because compared to the random case , the existence of self - affine long - range correlations is in favor of formation of larger clusters .\ncalculation of @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the total number of clusters with size @xmath121 per lattice sites ( fig.3 ) for the case of percolation on either direction shows this phenomenon clearly . for comparison , the @xmath122 s in random model when the concentration of filled sites is equal to @xmath42 of self affine models with @xmath116 , @xmath17 and @xmath117 are shown too .\nour numerical results for the values of the mean anisotropy parameters at percolation transition in either direction ( rule @xmath123 ) and percolation transition in specified direction ( rule @xmath124 ) have been appeared in fig.4 and fig.5 respectively . for comparison the corresponding values for random percolation have been also included .\ninterestingly , the differences between these two groups of curves are almost negligible , although the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is significant .\nin fact more investigations suggest that unlike random model , the shape of clusters of the self - affine model do not vary significantly with concentration @xmath34 of the filled sites .\nwe may conclude that the introduction of isotropic self - affinity subsidizes ( and even maybe removes ) the dependence of the number of a specific cluster configuration to concentration of filled sites .\none can observe that another important effect of self -

", "response": "\n\nThis article investigates the anisotropy of percolation clusters in self-affine models, comparing them to clusters in random percolation models. The primary research question is how introducing isotropic long-range correlations into a percolation system affects the shape of the resulting clusters.\n\nThe authors utilize numerical simulations to generate percolation clusters on square lattices. For self-affine models, they employ fractional Brownian motion (fbm) to introduce long-range correlations with varying Hurst exponents (H) representing persistent, anti-persistent, and uncorrelated scenarios. To quantify cluster shape, they calculate the anisotropy parameter, a measure of deviation from a perfectly spherical shape. This parameter is analyzed for different cluster sizes and concentrations of filled sites, allowing for comparisons between self-affine and random percolation models.\n\nThe study reveals several key findings. Firstly, percolation clusters in self-affine models exhibit slightly higher symmetry compared to those in random models, suggesting that long-range correlations promote more isotropic cluster formation.\n\nSecondly, the specific value of the anisotropy parameter is influenced by the Hurst exponent (H). Persistent correlations (H > 0.5) lead to a faster growth of the larger principal radius of gyration, resulting in more elongated clusters. Conversely, anti-persistent correlations (H < 0.5) produce clusters that are more spherical.\n\nThirdly, unlike random models, the shape of self-affine clusters shows minimal dependence on the concentration of filled sites. This suggests that the introduction of long-range correlations diminishes the influence of site concentration on cluster morphology. Lastly, the difference in anisotropy parameters between self-affine and random models becomes less pronounced as the Hurst exponent approaches 0.5, indicating a convergence in cluster shape towards random behavior.\n\nThe study concludes that self-affine correlations, particularly persistent ones, contribute to a more isotropic nature of percolation clusters compared to random models. The findings provide valuable insights into the impact of long-range correlations on the geometric properties of percolation clusters.\n"}
{"id": "summarization_025", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nStandby for incoming wall of text! \n The Setup: \n My girlfriend (let's call her 'Arty') and I have been together for nearly two years and are by and large very content with the nature of our relationship save for the titular issue (more on that later). We are each other's longest lasting relationship (in her case the previous longest was six weeks, mine was a month), I'm her 5th boyfriend and she's my second girlfriend (just a month after breaking up with my previous). We don't argue much, we interact well despite different interests and hobbies and generally, if we're both in the same locale, we're attached at the hip. Affectionate, playful, happy sex life, the whole gamut. \n However, the singular most constricting aspect of this relationship is her parents. They'd be strict by nearly any decent standards of parenting, and possibly quite a bit beyond. She is severely limited in what she can do, where she can go, and a very rigid timeline. This is on top of all the arbitrary rules that seem to just spring up contra to any plans that we would make (eg, get a call halfway to going out to the park to be told we cannot because she is 'wearing a dress'). \n This, however, is not my conundrum... The above I can deal with as, had I not had the intensity of feelings I have for my significant other I would have ended it over a year ago with the amount of shit and bullshit I've gone through with regards to her parents.\nHowever, things very much came to a head last June. \n The Incident: \n Arty requires corrective lenses. No, you don't understand she requires /corrective lenses/. Her uncorrected vision at best is, I'm told, 20/250. Calling her glasses 'coke bottles' is putting it nicely to the thickness of the lenses. Her vision has been poor since she was a small child, and as I'm sure nearly all of you are aware, children are not kind. \n Last June, she went to a local optometrist college/university eye center for a fitting for contact lenses. Needless to say, she was rather excited. She had phoned me multiple times each day for a week leading up to this, asking me if I would be there for her, if I could go, asking me to go, etc. I reassured her that I could and indeed would go. The day before, I get a text message from her telling me to not come. When prompted for her reasoning, she told me that her mother (also her ride) did not wish for me to go, citing that I need not inconvenience myself. \n I wish to point out how the above statement is very odd, as they're fine with me driving 15 miles (24km) each way on my own dime to visit, and that, while the distance from my house to the college we both attended is larger than that to the eye center, the drive to the eye center would actually take less time (~7 minutes as opposed to ~12 to the college). So my inability to take a hint, plus my want to be present for my girlfriend in what she considered a huge life event led me to drive the very next day to the eye appointment. I mean, we had been together over a year by this point, so I thought it'd be good to be there for her, apparently surprising both her and her mother (who made no real statement of displeasure or surprise, but rather just a dour gaze the whole time). \n It was after the appointment that things went to all hell as it were. She stated that her parents were rather upset (including mentioning that her father stated that he did not want me on his property again, including the doorstep) and did not want her to contact me. We could only have surreptitious contact after that point through IMs (as her parents go through the monthly phone statement/records of texts and calls sent), whereupon her laptop began to receive 'connection time out' errors when using their home WiFi, save for Skype and ooVoo, eventually just ooVoo, and then eventually no internet utilities worked (which I'm not unconvinced they configured their router for that). \n Aside from that day and going to see 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' two weeks earlier, I didn't see her in person all 3 months of summer break. \n I was able to see her during school the past fall semester despite her having only what amounted to a 45 minute break twice per week (she only had classes on T/R), plus the restriction of her parents' significant distaste for me prevented us from doing much of... anything (she later began skipping a class she was doing poorly in and eventually dropped to spend more time together, which added about an hour and a half each day, but still)... \n Over the winter break I didn't see her at all during the holidays, any plans made with mutual friends would be cancelled last minute by her mother (\"Who is this person? Your friend? No he's 'steaLLLth's' friend, why don't you do things with /your/ friends?\"). And... then she was sent to a different school (which her mother had threatened to do over a year ago if she didn't keep her grades up, even though she didn't fail a course) under the guise of 'saving money on gas'. \n I'm going to take a pause for a minute here to describe her living situation (and hopefully preempt some 'why does she take this from them? she needs to grow a spine and move out' comments) in order to provide a glimpse into her mentality and what makes the situation with her parents extraordinarily difficult for me to determine the best course of action. \n The Background: \n My beloved is one of the sweetest people I know. Unfortunately, she's also one of the more emotional and one of the more naive as well. Some of the claims that follow are what she told me. I find some to spurious and a hyperbolic to the point of incredulity, but I'd say 'It may not be completely true, but it's not that far off'... \n Arty was born to a couple [13F][17M] (her biological parents or 'bios') approximately five (that's what she says, I'll buy 'four') months premature. As anyone born that premature and surviving, she had significant medical complications, including requiring heart surgery, probably poor eyesight, asthma, and just being overall tiny. I know not if she was given up, or the couple (due to their young age) was forced to hand her over. \nShe was placed with a family (hereafter known as her family and parents, which also is the family she currently lives with) for the first ~5u1/2 years of her life, whereupon the birth couple attained custody again for the next ~11-12 years. During this time she suffered significant physical, verbal, emotional, mental, and sexual abuse at the hands of both parents, and was oft reminded by her mother that she was unwanted and should not have been born. \nAfter this time, Arty had had enough, speaking to a social worker about everything going on, she was asked if there was anyone/any family she would like to stay with. She remembered those that cared for her during her early years (they kept in touch during the twelve years), and was placed there at request. \n This turns what something that should be cut and dry into a massive tangle of variables and hypotheticals because of the emotions and history at play: \n 1) Her birth parents treated her horribly, so while where she is at is better parenting by far, I (and many others I've mentioned it to) do not believe it to be /good/ parenting. \n 2) She likely views the family as 'rescuing' her, as she's agreed with all the points I've made, but seems easily swayed by her mother (though that influence appears to be slowly crumbling). \n 3) Coupled with 2), I believe her naivete for what her mother says blinds her to the obvious (keep this in mind, I'll explain why shortly). \n 4) Because of the great abuse at the hands of her bios, and the very institutionalised and rigid scheduling of her parents (which I believe to be emotional abuse), she has not really established the independence or freedom that a typical 21y/o would have, and instead is greatly dependent on her parents and family, emotionally and financially. \n 5) Coupled with 4) I believe that she is afraid to choose me over them (though I fear such a choice may have to be made), that her parents and family would not contact her again, which would communicate to her that even the people who 'rescued' her don't even really care. \n 6) I know not if there's an insurmountable cultural bias against me, as her parents are Mexican Roman-Catholic, and I'm a very WASPy German-Irish Protestant. \n Transitioning back, all the above begins to come into play with her background with this family and how they treat me... \n The Issue: \n Since the eye appointment, it's obvious the resentment held against me. I know not if the parents' resentment is purely from the eye appointment alone, some slight in addition to that that I didn't realise I did, or whatnot.\nTwo weeks later, at the advice of numerous (middle-aged) individuals, I swallowed my pride, called their home phone, and apologized on their answering machine. Arty had listened to the message and had spoken to her mother, informing her of the message and requesting she listen to it. Her mother replied that she'd let her father know about it before listening. I'm told by my girlfriend a few days later that they had gotten a new answering machine since I left my message (she doesn't know if the parents ever heard the message) and told me that her parents wanted me to just call and leave another message. I call, and after about the fourth ring, I hear dial-up/modem noises... Their 'answering machine' apparently is actually some sort of fax machine. Needless to say I cannot leave a message. \n It's suggested and stated multiple times that they want is me to apologise, despite my attempts. Arty suggests that I go over to the house to apologise, but do remember that her father never wanted me on his property again, and I can't call or text my girlfriend to let her know that I'm at the house... \nIt's like saying 'all you have to is walk through the door' while they make sure it's been shut, locked, bolted, barred, bricked up, barricaded and electrified... while on fire. \n In early September, my stepfather died, and I decide that life is too short to try and harbor anything on pride/ego. I make contact with my girlfriend (though nothing was said to indicate this, she eventually started calling and texting me without her parents seeming to care), mainly to inform her of the death and cope with some of my grief, and then I later call her mother's mobile to attempt to apologise. The phone didn't ring for a full thirty seconds (she ignored the call) and I didn't leave a message. In the weeks following (beginning of October), my mother was found unresponsive and hospitalised. Around this time, Arty mentions that her mother said that I was 'lying' when I said I tried to contact her. So, I sent a formal (if slightly antagonistic) string of text messages and screenshots of the calls on the night my stepfather died, basically saying 'I'm not lying, and with these there's no way what you say could be true' (paraphrased). My grandmother and aunt had flown in from Chicago at this time as my mother was gravely ill and no-one expected her to live. I receive a call from Arty's mom. However, at the time, I was in a vehicle with four other people and could not hear a thing. I said, \"I can't hear you right now, can I cal-', and heard a click. I attempted to call her back, and basically said: 'Look, I dunno what I did... but I did what I did, I did what I didn't do, I did whatever you thought it was I did, I don't care... I'll own it, whatever it may be and I apologise. I don't want to fight anymore. I don't want to be at odds, if not for my sake, for Arty's. Contact me when you hear this message.' \nStill have not heard from her. \n That was a monday, and I headed back home to my father's house (my mother lives approximately an hour away... which was why my girlfriend never met my stepfather as her mother said that was 'too far of a drive'). \n My girlfriend had class mondays and wednesdays that semester. On wednesday, I pressed her, saying I wanted her to go with me to hospital to see my mother (who we still thought would die imminently) telling her to message her mother and ask... This was at 8 in the morning. She didn't get out of class till three, and I was trying to get her to message her mother and get a solid answer so she could go /earlier/ (because you know... death waits for no-one). Got answers of 'we'll talk about it when you get home.' after pressing her to press her mother, she got an answer after class tantamount to 'yes, death is sad, but that's not really your concern, come home.' And so she did, as I (trying to not napalm my bridges with her parents further) did not try and force her into a decision. \n However, I've essentially resolved that if my mother should not mean anything to my girlfriend, my girlfriend's mother should not mean anything to me. \n Continuing on... (OH MY GOD, YOU'RE NOT DONE YET!? D:) \n The semester draws to a close, and in the last week of school have a very lovely lunch date (she dropped her midday class), some wonderful sex and cuddles (yay), and then we go our separate ways, staying in touch through the miracle of modern technology. There was no Christmas together. I only see her at a new year's eve party through a mutual friend (I made sure Arty's mother would not know I was going to be there), and spent some time together there before she had to leave (her mother picked her up at 10PM... from a new year's eve party... >.<\"). \n In the interim, she began asking me my thoughts on her going to a different college... words were had as to why. \nApparently: \n 1) Her brothers (her rides; also permanently placed) had graduated with associates from the same junior college that we attended. \n 2) Her mother intended for them to 'save money on gas', so as not to have her brothers drive there and back by sending her somewhere closer as the distance to the college she was at is ~10 miles (16km) from them. \n I, of course, call bullshit over the whole thing, reasons being: \n 1) She is in 'permanent placement' (being adopted... but not technically being adopted). So are her brothers... Yet they went to the same college, from the same address, over the same 10mi/16km distance, in two /separate/ vehicles, since before she was placed in that family. \n 2) If they aren't traveling to the college, then that means they have /all that gas/ that they're not paying for. If they use one vehicle instead of two to send her there, they're /saving/ money on gas. \n 3) She's switching college districts and not transferring to a 4 year institution. Therefore, she'll lose any priority registration she has, would need to go to another orientation, lose any course clearance she has, and potentially lose some completed units. \n 4) She was threatened to be moved to a different school if she didn't keep her grades up (I think they thought I was to blame), and apparently it didn't even matter that she did. \n 5) [I'll give this one to them, as this hadn't happened at the time they were planning it, but still] Gas prices fell about a dollar and a half per gallon over the winter break. \n Semester starts, we're planning to get her out of the house, she's worried about where she can go, she's taking classes and I'm taking classes... and I hear two things (very recently) that appall me: \n 1) One of her brothers is taking classes at the sister school that we attended. Why this is horrific is that if she registered here, she could have kept EVERYTHING. Units, transcripts, priority, clearances. It's in the same college district! WHY CAN'T SHE GO WITH HIM THERE?! \n 2) Her mother is going to have her start bussing to school. She'll take more than two busses, which means an all-day bus pass would be the best option (or some weekly/monthly/time pass). But... that saves no more/less gas or money than her taking the bus TO THE OLD COLLEGE! \n It's clear, methinks (don't you?), that they're trying to separate her from me and very nearly all costs with no regard for what she wants (including her stating that she wanted to go to the old college). \n The Conclusion:\nMy question, r/relationships, revolves around the old adage 'marry the woman, marry the family'. And I really, ^really^ love this girl, but I fear that the only time the parents will ever warm up to me is after they're six feet under. I don't want to force her to choose between me and them, but I really don't know what to do regarding them. Do I proverbially kick down the door, say 'Fuck you, fuck your couch, and fuck the horse you rode in on; come on, Arty let's get you outta here' or do I stay cordial and polite (when/if they do interact with me) on the hope that maybe decades from now, they'll actually treat me amicably? Do I need them? For her? Help me out here. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1. Identify the main topic and primary arguments presented in the article.\n2.

{"id": "summarization_026", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \n Taking your own soft blanket and pillow or neck pillow can really make your flight much more comfortable. Though some airlines offer tiny flat pillows and itchy blankets, you may be better off taking your own. You can find sets of pillows and blankets that are surprisingly compact and which aren't a huge pain to carry. In a pinch, you can even buy them near the terminal, so you don't have to take them through security, though this will be more costly.\n\n\nIf you have your blanket and pillow, you won't have to worry about staying warm or getting a stiff neck.;\n, These can help you keep your hands clean and clean up your tray table. You don't want to have a dirty or sticky tray table after your first meal, or it will be a pain for the duration of the flight. Having sanitary/anti-bacterial wipes on hand will also keep you from having to get up and wash your hands every time you eat something.\n\n, Though some airlines provide these, especially for long flights, there are no guarantees. Having an eye mask will help you doze off and to rest your eyes. Though the lights in a plane will dim on an overnight flight, you may still want some extra protection for your eyes.\n\n, These can also help you drown out the sounds on the plane when you try to rest. You may get stuck near a crying child or two people who talk incessantly, and you want to protect yourself against that just in case. Again, some planes may offer ear plugs, but it's best not to count on it. Noise-cancelling headphones, while a lot bigger than ear plugs, can really make the world around you feel silent, and bring you peace and tranquility.\n\n\nListening to music on any suitable personal device if you brought headphones for music, can also help you drown out the noise around you.\n\n, Think comfort over international jet-setting model. Seriously, don't wear stiff, tight or itchy clothing – you'll soon regret it if you do. Wear loose clothing that is easily cleaned. Avoid synthetic materials that overheat and expensive labels which can draw unwanted attention. Avoid unnecessary clothing like jewelry, belts and boots that will slow you down through security checkpoints and are potential pickpocket attractants in some destinations. Remember that the fewer valuables you bring; the less you have to worry about. Here are some tips for clothes to bring to make your long flight more bearable:\n\n\nTake clothes that will keep you warm in case the plane gets cold. Some flights can get pretty chilly, so make sure you take a fleece or sweater, a scarf, or maybe even a knit hat to keep you warm in case that happens.\nWear layers. Make sure you have a tank top or t-shirt under the long-sleeved shirt or sweater you're wearing. Planes can also get really hot around take off and landing, and you don't want to be stuck in a heavy shirt with nothing underneath.\nTake warm socks. Socks can help keep your feet warm if you're wearing sandals, and they can also be a great substitute for shoes so your feet are comfortable on your flight.\nInstead of stiff pants or jeans, wear leggings, sweatpants, or loose pants to keep your legs comfortable.\nIf you're getting off the plane and heading straight out to explore the city where you're staying, then take a change of clothes with you in your carry-on luggage.\nSilk long underwear is lightweight, takes up no room, and is great if you are going to a colder climate and don't want to buy an entire wardrobe for it. Ditto for a black cashmere sweater.\n\n, If you're the kind of person who needs to brush their teeth after every meal or if you just want to avoid that gross \"haven't-brushed-my-teeth-in-a-while\" feeling in your mouth, then you may be well served by taking a small toothbrush and toothpaste on the flight. Though it won't be super easy to brush your teeth in the tiny airplane bathroom, it's better than having a mossy mouth.\n\n\nNote that the TSA association limits liquids, gels, and aerosols to 3.4oz. per container; and up to 1 quart for each hand carry luggage.\n\n, You can also take some gum to make your breath fresher, if this is easier. This will not only refresh your breath, but you can also chew gum when the plane takes off and lands to avoid having your ears pop due to the rapid change in pressure.\n\n, There are two approaches to this. One is to leave it all up to the airline (be sure to check what they offer first) and travel as light as possible. The other is to take your own entertainment items because you don't trust that the airline's offerings are adequate. Just be aware that there are weight restrictions and that the more things you take with you, the more things you have to worry about losing, breaking or having stolen. It also means less room in your bags for bringing back souvenirs and treats from wherever you're traveling to.\n\n\nOn the other hand, some items will be handy during the trip itself and not just on the plane (for example an MP3 Player or an eReader), so letting them do double duty is great.\nThe other thing to consider is that, if you want to pay for a movie or on-flight entertainment, it can be quite expensive. Though it's complimentary on some flights, you should look into the policy of the airline you're taking. You may be better off renting a movie on iTunes or Google Play and watching it on your Tablet or computer (though the volume may be a bit lower than it would be on the plane's movies) for 3-4 dollars a pop than paying 10 dollars or more to watch a movie on the plane. Also, if you select your movies in advance, you'll have more options to choose from.\n\n, The things you might consider carrying on the plane include an MP3 Player for music and audio books, a laptop or Tablet for writing and reading (and surfing on your trip), a portable DVD player (although this will be quite bulky and your hotel rooms in many places have DVD players) or a portable gaming console such as a Nintendo 3DS or a PSVita. Each has pluses and minuses that you need to weigh up. If you're going on vacation, however, you may want to leave your laptop or other things that remind you of work at home.\n\n\nTake your cell phone; you may need it on the trip and even if it cannot be used on the plane, it should be with you for safekeeping. Keep in mind that many newer planes have in-flight entertainment available.\nAnd if you take a laptop or Tablet, make sure to have fully charged it before leaving. Depending on the length of the flight, you may wish to consider investing in a portable battery pack to keep all of your electronics fully charged if there are no power points available on the plane.\n\n, If you haven't read that novel yet or caught up on the news, here's your chance. Don't forget that you can also stock up on the latest magazines in the airport before boarding the plane and if you manage to read them on the flight, you don't need to cart them with you off the flight! If you have an eReader, you might like to take it as it can store hundreds of novels or other reading material, including guidebook information for your destination. Here are some forms of reading material you can take:\n\n\nNovels (take more than one in case your book gets boring)\nCelebrity gossip magazines, such as Us Weekly\n\nReputable magazines, such as The New Yorker, The Economist, or TIME\nThe newspaper\nMaterials to read for school or work\n\nIf you like to write, you can also take writing material, such as a journal, a laptop, or an article you're preparing. This can be the perfect time to write.\n\n\n\n, Whether you're traveling with friends or hoping to make friends with someone sitting next to you, taking along some games is a great way to keep yourself entertained. You can take dice, cards, or travel-sized versions of games like Sorry! or even magnetic chess or checkers. If you're traveling with someone, make sure it's a game that he or she would want to play in advance.\n\n\nYou can also take a notepad so you can play games like MASH or Hangman with another person.\nYou can also come prepared with some simple games that only require you to talk. For example, you can play \"Geography\": all you do is say the name of a country or city; after that, your partner has to say the name of a country or city that starts with the last letter of the country or city you said; then you have to do the same, and you go back and forth until one of you can't think of anything to say or repeats a country or city that was already said.\nYou can also take a book of Mad Libs to keep you and your friend or seat mate entertained.\n\n, Another way to keep yourself entertained, especially if you're by yourself, is to take a book of crossword puzzles, Sudoku, or other word or number puzzles. This way, you can just dip into the puzzle whenever you want and feel the time flying by. Just one medium-level crossword could take two or more hours to complete, and you'll see the time whizzing by as you get to work.\n\n\nYou can also take a book of MENSA brain teasers, which will be a combination of word puzzles, number puzzles, and other tricky challenges.\n\n, This is important if you want to use them to stay entertained during your long trip. Though you may get lucky and sit in an aisle that has an outlet, this isn't too likely. You should also be sure to put the charger in your carry-on bag! It's awfully easy to leave the charger at home and spoil your vacation with lamentations about leaving it behind. Ditto for international Sim card, phone cards or portable broadband USB connectors.\n\n\nIf you're really desperate to charge one of your electronic devices, one of the stewardesses may do this for you in the back of the plane, but don't count on it.\nMany airlines today allow you to charge in flight. Look on seatguru.com and look up the different options available to you.\n\n, Snacks do break up the monotony of the flight as well as helping stave off any unexpected hunger in between airline meals. If you're on a restricted diet or just want to snack without paying $5 for a tiny bag of Pop Chips or Chex Mix, then taking your own snacks is the way to go. This will also make it a bit easier for you to eat whenever you want, instead of waiting for the stewardesses to come around. Here are some snacks that won't spoil and will leave you feeling satiated while giving you a boost of energy:\n\n\nApples\nTrail mix\nAlmonds, cashews, or pistachios\nA granola bar (as long as it doesn't crumble too much)\nYogurt-covered raisins\nPretzels\nDried mango or bananas\n\n, Airline travel is dehydrating, so stick to drinking water and plenty of it. Though you can't take a bottle of water past security, you can buy one near the terminal before you board your flight. You should also accept any chance you get to get a cup of water, because you don't know the next time the stewardess can come around. Of course, you can usually ask for water at the back of the plane or even by pushing the \"call\" button, but it's easier to simply accept the water when it comes your way.\n\n\nOf course, while it's very important to drink water, you also don't want to be running to the bathroom every five minutes to pee, especially if you have a window seat and are worried about inconveniencing the people in your row. Find a balance between staying hydrated and not having your bladder feel full the whole time. Keep in mind that it's more important, though, to be hydrated with a full bladder than to be dehydrated and not have to pee.\n\n, Eye drops help prevent your eyes from drying out in flight. Though they aren't mandatory, they really can help you if you experience the dry eyes that many people have during a flight. It can be pretty uncomfortable if you realize that your eyes are getting dry in the first hour of a ten-hour flight and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\n\nJust make sure that your container of eye drops is small enough that you can take it on the plane and make it through security with it without a problem.\n\n, According to the National Institutes of Health, there is a small risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on flights longer than four hours. Staying active will help prevent this from happening. You should try to walk up and down the aisles of the plane as much as you can, move, flex, and stretch your legs to keep your blood flowing, and wear clothing that is loose and comfortable. Here are some other things you can do:\n\n\nHydrate the day before the flight and during the flight\nWear compression stockings to keep your legs from swelling if you're at risk (talk to your doctor about risk factors)\nAvoid alcohol the night before or during the flight because it will dehydrate you. The same goes for coffee, soft drinks, and chocolate.\nTake baby aspirin the night before and the day of your flight if you don't have any problems with ulcers.Try to get an aisle seat so you can easily walk around the plane.\n\n, Take anti-nausea medication, pain relief medication, sleep aids, or any of the regular medication that you take on the plane with you so you don't find yourself in need of medication in the middle of your flight. Make sure to take your regular medication as well as any medication you typically use for pain relief in case you get a headache, neck ache, or experience another pain. Make sure you Take ALL medications in its original packaging. You may need to show your prescription for some medications prior to some international flights.\n\n\nIf you're thinking of taking a sleep aid to help you sleep on an overnight flight, make sure you try it out in advance. You don't want to try it for the first time on your flight and then end up having a miserable experience on your flight and after you land.\n\n, Obviously, you need to know the available flights for your destination and the price has to be \"right\". However, other things you should be considering when booking for a long haul flight is just how comfortable that airline will prove to be. Some airlines do offer more legroom than others on particular sectors and this is an important consideration the longer the flight gets; do some research and read the advertising promises, as well as checking out people's opinions in online travel and flight forums.\n\n\nCheck out what entertainment is offered by the airline. Many newer aircraft types offer individualized monitors in the back of the seat right in front of you, so that you don't have to crane your neck to try to see a wobbly old movie screen with someone else's head in front of it.\nA lot of these individual entertainment centers now come with lots of movies, news, documentary, etc. choices, as well as radio, music and games that can be played using a handheld device that lifts out from the seat.\n\n, Though somebody's got to be stuck in that middle seat, you should do what you can to get the seat you want. First, you should figure out which seat you prefer, the aisle or the window. The aisle may be the most comfortable for a long flight because you have a bit more room on the side facing the aisle and can easily get up and stretch your legs or use the restroom without inconveniencing people; however, some people like the window because it's easier to rest against it, and because it can be pleasant to look outside. Whatever you choose, here are some tips for picking your seat:\n\n\nMost airlines allow you to choose your seat when you book your flight. Don't overlook this important aspect of booking the flight, even if you're in a rush.\nIf you didn't choose a seat online, try to choose it when you check in, or even at the gate of the flight. Though your flight might be full and you may not be able to switch your seat, it's worth trying.\nYou can try to sit toward the front of the plane so you get to board earlier and leave the plane earlier. The downside is that you may be further from the bathroom.\nYou should try to get a seat in an exit row, where you'll have more leg room.\nTry to avoid seats in front of the exit row, however. Some of them do not recline!\nYou should also avoid the seats at the very back of the plane. Not only do the seats in the last row typically not recline, but they'll be right near the bathrooms, so the smell won't be as pleasant.\nChoose the window seat if you can. It has been said that looking out the window during takeoff reduces dizziness.\n\n, While it is cheaper to have a \"lap baby\" (an infant that has no seat and just sits in your lap throughout the flight), it's not as safe as having a child in his own seat (most airlines allow you to use a car carrier in-flight). Moreover, you're not likely to be permitted to have a baby on your lap for long haul flights that are international.\n\n, If you're flying from San Francisco to Paris, an hour-long layover in Brussels may be tempting, but you should make sure to give yourself at least two, or even three hours between tight connections if you want to make sure you make the next flight. If you're traveling internationally, you may have to go through passport control and take other security measures that take up a lot of time, not to mention trying to find your terminal at the other end of an unfamiliar airport. If you want your flight to be stress free, try to pick a connection that will give you enough time to catch your second flight.\n\n, If you can sleep your hours away, this can be a bonus as you'll arrive fresher and possibly overcome jet lag faster. Obviously, the drawback here is cost; although you can investigate the chances of upgrading using your air/frequent flier miles or points and perhaps even finding a sensational online deal for a business class trip. It can be worth it to do some deeper research into the options or to pay a little more for extra comfort – and you won't know unless you try!\n\n, Most airlines offer a huge array of dietary preferences for international and long haul flights. However, you must book anything that is not the usual run-of-the-mill food choices and it's very wise to double check 24 hours before you're due to fly out, just to make sure the dietary preference you've ordered is properly recorded. It's really depressing to get on a long haul flight and realize you have no food to eat because they botched up the order! In addition, some airlines require you to request special meals at least 24 hours in advance; with Kosher meals, you might even need to request the special catering more than 48 hours in advance.\n\n, Call the airline if you have any dietary, access (for example, a wheelchair or walker) or other issues needing to be double checked. It's probably best to do this 24 to 12 hours in advance of departure. Check that you have any needed medications and accompanying prescriptions. It's important to be prepared in the event that you have a health complication.\n\n\nIf you're prone to motion sickness, you can also take motion-sickness medication or even ginger tablets to help you feel well during your flight; though it's important to read the instructions on your medication, you should generally take motion sickness pills about two hours before your flight.\n\n, Losing your favorite pocket knife to security because you packed it in the carry-on bag instead of the cargo bag isn't much fun. Moreover, there are many prohibited items which can easily be found by checking the airport or airline websites, or you can look at the site of the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) for worldwide information.\n\n\nBe aware of baggage weight and size restrictions. Even more painful to your wallet than losing the pocket knife is the damage inflicted in fees for overweight bags! And if your carry-on bag is too big, you're stuffed, so get it right from the beginning. See How to avoid airline baggage fees for more information.\n\n, Although you might convince yourself that you'll \"sleep on the plane\", this isn't always guaranteed as you might feel uncomfortable or the passengers two seats across from you might be particularly raucous. Besides which, starting a flight feeling tired can predispose you to catching any bugs on board. The long time in the enclosed plane environment can expose you to other people's colds, flus and other nasties that you're more likely to be able to fight off it you're in great shape and not too tired. It's particularly important that both parents and children get a good night's sleep before a long haul flight, to avoid nerves, tears and frustration.\n\n, If you have an illness such as the tail-end of chicken pox or you're coughing a lot post a bad flu, have a dated doctor's certificate certifying that it's okay for you to fly (namely, that you're no longer contagious). You can be prevented from boarding if the boarding officials are concerned that you might be contagious. It's also important to get prescription notes or letters if you're carrying medications, to avoid drug charges in less understanding destinations. Read more about this in How to travel with prescription medications.\n\n, This will help you to pack properly and will help you to wear the right things on the plane. It's very uncomfortable stepping off a plane from a cold environment into a humid one when you're still wearing the heavy woolen sweater Gran knitted you and you've forgotten to wear a short-sleeved t-shirt underneath! The same thing goes for entering a colder climate after being in a warmer one; always have a coat with you in case the airport you disembark at requires tarmac walking to reach the terminal; it's not much fun wearing a t-shirt and sandals when the snow is pelting down on you or a fierce wind is blowing.\n\n, Check that everyone's passports are up to date. Many countries require at least 6 months validity to remain on the passport during the time of travel, so don't get caught out. Here are some other considerations to take when you get all of your documents in order:\n\n\nOrganize any visas needed before traveling. It is much easier to do this before you leave for another country than to be standing in line in a foreign airport endlessly worrying that they might not let you in.\nArrange for a mixture of foreign cash, traveler's checks and credit/debit cards for overseas travel. Talk to your bank to see what they offer in the way of exchange rates.\n\n, It can be all too easy to forget these in the excitement of preparing for a trip, so check with your doctor early to see if you need any. And if you need to stock up on any medications you take, do so now by letting your doctor know how long you'll be away for. Don't rely on buying needed medication in a foreign country as you might strike all sorts of problems from lack of the medication to not being able to see a doctor.\n\n, That includes your clothes, any medications you might need, plane tickets, passports and toiletries. It's sensible to create a list that helps keep you on track with what you should pack and that can be used for the entire trip to help ensure you've remembered all contents for your bag, as well as serving as a record of items if your bag gets lost or stolen.\n\n\nBe sure to have left information with neighbors, friends and family about what to do in the event of an emergency with your property (house, car, etc.), your pets or any children you've left behind with relatives or, if they're old enough, in your house.\n\n, A long haul flight usually presupposes that you'll be gone for a while and that you're less likely to take your car to the airport. However, do check out the long-term car storage price as it may be affordable and an option that works well for you, especially if you're concerned about the security of leaving your car at home while you're gone. Some airports offer good long-term parking rates. Otherwise, consider renting a car, using a shuttle service, hiring a taxi, or asking a neighbor or family member to drop you off at the airport. The latter option is especially nice because you get to have a farewell!\n\n, If you're disabled or require special access help, it's a good idea to arrive as early as possible to secure the arrangements needed to help you board on time and in comfort. If you're worried about what to do before the plane leaves if you're too early, there is a lot to do at most modern airports and you can always get out one of your books, games, journal or other forms of entertainment!\n\n\nWhile you're waiting in the airport, read How to be comfortable on a long airplane trip for ways to cope while on board!\n\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following dialog into a concise and accurate summary, ensuring that the key points and essential information are included.\n[Text Start]: \nIndustrial Designer: Oops That's as far as it goes {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: Hi guys uh good morning everybody here . And uh I want to introduce myself , uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here . And what you're uh drawing ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user {disfmarker} usability user interface designer .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} My name is Ed and I do accounting .\nProject Manager: Uh how you spell your name uh ?\nMarketing: E_D_ .\nProject Manager: E_D_ okay .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: And ?\nIndustrial Designer: Do you also do marketing ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: So only accounting ? Okay .\nMarketing: Accounting , yes .\nProject Manager: And ?\nIndustrial Designer: And I'm Christine ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer .\nProject Manager: Industrial designer .\nIndustrial Designer: But I'm not really one .\nProject Manager: So who is uh marketing , nobody in the market\nMarketing: Marketing is uh , is me {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: It's you , okay . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and uh we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from {disfmarker} with this .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh for the moment not yet .\nProject Manager: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but uh what's what's your uh {disfmarker} do you have some project plan , something with you or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Good question {vocalsound} . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . We'll have to {disfmarker} simply we'll have to work on it together .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay , so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay , a discussion with uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Certainly by the next meeting .\nProject Manager: By next meeting , okay that will be great . Uh Okay , so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ?\nIndustrial Designer: What is the goal of the project ?\nProject Manager: Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do {vocalsound} . We have to define exactly what our product is , from uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ?\nMarketing: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ?\nProject Manager: Oh I think uh , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control .\nUser Interface: Um I was wondering {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Remote controls , 'cause I had two different things . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yes .\nMarketing: we'll start with the remote control for television then . So we're have to design something that is very user friendly .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . Uh th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: And uh what abo uh Christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um no , I I have not begun working on the design ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor . Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , and um I understood that that was the project goal . So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and um that's about uh that's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps .\nProject Manager: So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh for the industrial design ?\nProject Manager: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have different choices with different financial models .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well , you know um , I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive {disfmarker} that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . So it would {disfmarker} really would need to um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so um d uh you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool .\nProject Manager: Okay , but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing , so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} And when would you like that ?\nProject Manager: B as soon as possible .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a {disfmarker} is close enough ?\nProject Manager: Yes I think uh that would be good , because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {vocalsound} are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ?\nProject Manager: Yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know . So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , I'll get back to you on that .\nProject Manager: Yes . Thank you . Okay . And uh Ed uh so what's {disfmarker} what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?\nMarketing: Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh {disfmarker} the competition ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: uh th I agree it has to be something {disfmarker} it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use .\nProject Manager: Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: so because you need to sell {disfmarker} and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the {disfmarker} your sales plan , okay , th\nMarketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for ,\nProject Manager: Th That {disfmarker} that's\nMarketing: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yes , that's {disfmarker} you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you {disfmarker} uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Very good .\nProject Manager: Okay , I can coordinate ,\nMarketing: Very good .\nProject Manager: or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Between uh all the coor\nUser Interface: Well , no , not exactly . I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work ,\nProject Manager: Th Christine , yeah {vocalsound} . Which is {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: and so it's sort of {disfmarker} it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it .\nProject Manager: Yes . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: then you will {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Which will also feed into the marketing ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .\nProject Manager: Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nUser Interface: So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account .\nProject Manager: Yep . But what I request , okay , {gap} keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening .\nUser Interface: Yeah , of course {vocalsound} . Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .\nProject Manager: Yes . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management .\nUser Interface: Sure . No problem .\nProject Manager: So any questions for uh time being ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No .\nUser Interface: So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or\nProject Manager: Yes .\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} okay .\nProject Manager: Okay . To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay ,\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: so then we can discuss about uh further things . So , we'll meet when the {disfmarker} we'll discuss on the further meeting .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: It's okay ? Thanks for coming .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ?\nProject Manager: Yes , I will .

Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nhospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( aecopd ) is recognized as a major event in the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) due to its negative effect on lung function , survival , risk of readmission , and quality of life.16 the prolonged length of stay ( los ) may also indicate more fragile patients who need more attention from health personel.7 although only 10%15% of all patients with copd will experience severe exacerbations that require hospital admission , expenditures associated with hospitalization represent more than 70% of all copd - related medical care costs.8 until now , no established predictors of prolonged los are available , and there is no international accepted norm of how long a hospitalization due to aecopd should be .\nthis is illustrated by the wide range of reported los ( 316 days).9,10 in the absence of a published definition for prolonged los , we defined a los longer than the 75th percentile as prolonged los in this article , which is in line with other studies.1113 a limited number of studies have published a heterogeneous set of variables that are associated with long hospital stay for aecopd .\nfor example , social and demographic data,14,15 clinical variables,10,1618 comorbidities,11,1922 number and type of drugs used on admission,11 and day of the week of the admission16 are among the risk factors for long los .\nthere is a lack of consistency in identified predictors of long los , which makes it difficult to determine which prognostic factors are most important . to the best of our knowledge\n, there are no established statistical models for predicting los based on variables collected at the time of hospital admission for aecopd .\nthus , increased knowledge about predictors of prolonged los and earlier prediction of los might contribute to better patient treatment , optimal discharge planning , and shortening of the los , which will ultimately lead to cost savings for hospitals .\nthe primary objective of this retrospective study was to identify predictors of prolonged los in patients hospitalized for aecopd .\na secondary objective was to develop a predictive model for los based on available variables obtained at the time of admission for aecopd .\nthe study included all patients with a discharge diagnosis of copd from march 2006 until december 2008 , after introduction of electronic medical records at oslo university hospital , aker .\nbased on the international statistical classification of disease and related health problems , 10th revision ( icd-10)23 , we included both patients with copd ( j43 or j44 ) as the main diagnosis , and patients with respiratory failure ( j96 ) or pneumonia ( j12j18 ) as the main diagnosis and copd ( j43 or j44 ) as a secondary diagnosis .\nalthough patients with different main diagnoses might have different los , we decided not to split the sample to keep it as big as possible .\nanother reason was that the diagnoses were set at the time of discharge and were therefore not available at the time of admission and could not be used as a predictor in this study .\nwe chose to include the first hospitalization of all consecutive patients hospitalized for aecopd in this period , regardless of number of previous admissions . in total\nwe extracted the following data from the computerized medical record at the time of hospital admission : demographic data , comorbidities , use of long -

related admissions during the previous 12 months before the current admission , and the day of the week of admission .\nthe reason for dichotomizing weekday was because we considered that the natural time of discharge for those admitted between thursday and saturday would be before the following weekend , and thus that they might have a higher risk of a prolonged stay . in the final multivariate analysis , we used only dichotomized weekdays in order to reduce the number of variables in the prediction model .\na copd -

agonist and systemic steroids may worsen heart failure30 and diabetes,22 respectively , it is understandable that a prolonged stay might be needed to get these comorbid conditions under control . that a high paco2 measured in the emergency department was associated with a prolonged los is reasonable because paco2 and other blood - gas variables reflect the severity of respiratory failure .\nthis finding is consistent with two previous studies16,31 but inconsistent with two others.25,26 the discrepant results of these studies may be due to differences between the patient populations , since patients needing intensive care and with infiltration on chest radiographs indicating pneumonia were excluded from the latter two studies .\nour finding of an association of low serum albumin level with a long los is consistent with a british study demonstrating an association between a low serum albumin level and a los > 7 days.31 serum albumin level is a marker of nutritional status,32 with a low level being associated with higher long - term mortality in copd patients.2,33 albumin also forms a part of the acute - phase protein response , and hence low serum albumin level may reflect the deterioration of clinical status or increased persistent inflammation during aecopd.33 in the present study , we wanted to identify patients with prolonged los primarily because such patients may have a worse health status and hence an increased need for post - discharge support.34 in the absence of a standardized definition of prolonged los , we decided to use a los cutoff at the 75th percentile rather than at the median1113 because the potential benefit from improved discharge planning would be greater with increasing los . in univariate analysis , increasing age was significantly associated with a los longer than 11 days .\nthis can , for example , be attributed to older patients being more fragile , having lower serum albumin values , having more comorbidities , or more severe copd exacerbations and higher paco2 .\ntherefore , age by itself was no longer significantly related to prolonged los , and the age effect was probably captured by the other variables .\nsome evidence supports that social circumstances affect los.15 however , in this data set , we had no feasible variable for social factors like income , class , or ( earlier ) profession .\nthe area under the roc curve was 0.73 , suggesting a poor to fair performance .\nalthough the usefulness of a prediction model does not follow directly from how big the area under the roc curve , a level of 73% will in most cases be too low for the purpose of resource planning in a hospital , while a level close to 80% is usually considered sufficient for practical use.35 the present roc curve illustrates how one must trade sensitivity for specificity  if we need to correctly identify 75% of the patients with a los > 11 days , we must accept that 50% of the patients with a los 11 are incorrectly classified . alternatively , if we require that 75% of the patients with a los 11 be correctly classified , only approximately 50% of the patients with a los > 11 will be identified . in our opinion , these uncertainties are too large for the predictions to be useful in a clinical setting .\nthere may be several reasons for the suboptimal performance of this model , with one possibility being the presence of a large random component that is independent of patient - related variables .\nprevious studies found that only 8%12% of los variation could be explained by clinical variables.18,36 a us study showed that hospital stays for patients hospitalized for aecopd were considerably extended beyond what was considered strictly necessary because physicians observed patients an extra day to be certain that patients could cope at home after discharge.16 such individual assessment is one of several random elements that are difficult to incorporate in a statistical prediction model .\nadditionally , local practice guidelines , hospital resources , and the organization of care may influence los.24,37 some limitations of this retrospective study should be discussed .\nthe number of variables in the analyses was limited ; hence , potentially important predictors might have been missed .\nwe reduced the possibility of false - positive findings by limiting the number of variables before the analysis .\nsome medical records at the time of the admission were incomplete , for example , lacked information on comorbidities or results of tests actually being done on admission .\nthis was partially compensated by imputing values for missing values for the variables that we thought would be most important \nthis imputation contributed to reducing the uncertainty associated with missing data and avoided the exclusion of patients , which would have reduced the effect of the results of the study . in our case , we had no indication that the missing values for serum albumin , paco2 and fev1 were systematically missing .\nthose patients with incomplete data would be excluded , which could also introduce bias.38 finally , the study population was recruited from a single university hospital in oslo , which served as a primary hospital for a geographically defined area of the city .\nhowever , the included population was relatively large and unselected in that all patients with a discharge diagnosis of copd were included .\nfurthermore , both age and los in this population were comparable to those in previous larger studies from other countries , which support the external validity of our sample.24,31\nin conclusion , we found that admission between thursday and saturday , paco2 , serum albumin level , and comorbidities such as heart failure , diabetes , and stroke were associated with los .\nthe reported findings may help physicians to identify patients at risk of a long los in the early stages of an aecopd admission , and thus introduce the possibility of offering better follow - up .\nhowever , we were unable to create a robust scoring model for risk stratification that would have been useful for discharge planning .\nthe reasons for prolonged los are probably multidimensional , and future studies should focus on both patient- and non - patient - related factors . \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified independent predictors of prolonged LOS, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess the model's predictive performance.\n\nKey findings revealed that admission between Thursday and Saturday, elevated arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), low serum albumin level, and presence of heart failure, diabetes, or stroke were independently associated with prolonged LOS.  However, the ROC analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.73, suggesting limited accuracy for predicting prolonged LOS.\n\nThe study acknowledges the complexity of predicting LOS, highlighting the potential influence of unmeasured factors such as individual physician practice and hospital resource availability.  While the identified predictors can aid clinicians in recognizing patients at higher risk of prolonged hospitalization early on, the model's accuracy may not be sufficient for reliable discharge planning.

{"id": "summarization_029", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nIntroduction\nDebt Limit Legislation\nWhen the receipts collected by the federal government are not sufficient to cover outlays, it is necessary for the Treasury to finance the shortfall through the sale of various types of debt instruments to the public and federal agencies. Federal borrowing is subject to a statutory limit on public debt (referred to as the debt limit or debt ceiling). When the federal government operates with a budget deficit, or otherwise increases the level of debt necessary (such as to allow federal trust funds to hold surpluses), the response has been for the public debt limit to be increased to meet that need. The frequency of congressional action to raise the debt limit has ranged in the past from several times in one year to once in several years. In recent years, Congress has chosen to suspend the debt limit for a set amount of time instead of raising the debt limit by a fixed dollar amount. When a suspension period ends, the debt limit is reestablished at a dollar level that accommodates the level of federal debt issued during the suspension period.\nLegislation to raise the public debt limit falls under the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. In some cases, Congress has combined other legislative provisions with changes in the debt limit. For example, the Senate amended a House-passed bill raising the debt limit to add the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The House added debt limit provisions (as well as other matters) to an unrelated Senate-passed measure to create the Budget Control Act of 2011. In addition, debt limit provisions may be included in reconciliation legislation (described in a separate section of this report).\nIn the 96 th Congress (1979-1980), the House amended its rules to provide for the automatic engrossment of a measure increasing the debt limit upon final adoption of a budget resolution. The rule (commonly referred to as the Gephardt Rule after Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri) was intended to facilitate quick action on debt limit increases by deeming such a measure as passed by the House by the same vote as the final adoption of the budget resolution, thereby avoiding the need for a separate vote on the debt limit. The engrossed measure would then be transmitted to the Senate for further action. The rule was repealed in the 107 th Congress, reinstated in the 108 th Congress, repealed again in the 112 th Congress, and reinstated in modified form in the 116 th Congress.\nAs currently provided in House Rule XXVIII, the rule provides for a measure to automatically be engrossed and deemed to have been passed by the House by the same vote as the adoption by the House of the concurrent resolution on the budget if the resolution sets forth a level of the public debt that is different from the existing statutory limit. Rather than a specific level of debt, however, this measure would suspend the debt limit through the end of the budget year for the concurrent resolution on the budget (but not through the period covered by any outyears beyond the budget year). As with the earlier version of the rule, the engrossed measure would then be transmitted to the Senate for further action.\nThe Senate has no special procedures concerning consideration of debt limit legislation.\nRevenue Legislation\nArticle I, Section 8, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to levy \"taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\" Section 7 of this article, known as the Origination Clause, requires that all revenue measures originate in the House of Representatives. Legislation concerning taxes and tariffs falls under the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Furthermore, House Rule XXI, clause 5, specifically bars the consideration of a tax or tariff measure reported from another committee (or an amendment containing a tax or tariff provision, including a Senate amendment, from being offered to a House measure reported by another committee). Neither the Origination Clause nor House Rule XXI, clause 5, applies to the consideration of legislation concerning receipts or collections, such as user fees, that are levied on a class that benefits from a particular service, program, or activity.\nMost revenues derive from existing provisions of the tax code or Social Security law, which continue in effect from year to year unless changed by Congress and are generally expected to produce increasing amounts of revenue in future years if the economy expands and incomes rise or the workforce grows. Nevertheless, Congress typically makes some changes in the tax laws each year, either to raise or lower revenues or to redistribute the tax burden.\nIn enacting revenue legislation, Congress often includes provisions that establish or alter tax expenditures. The term tax expenditures is defined in the 1974 CBA to include revenue forgone due to deductions, exemptions, credits, and other exceptions to the basic tax structure. Tax expenditures are a means by which the federal government uses the tax code to pursue public policy objectives and can be regarded as alternatives to spending policy actions such as grants or loans. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the revenue effects of legislation changing tax expenditures, and it also publishes five-year projections of these provisions as an annual committee print.\nCongress may choose to act on revenue legislation pursuant to proposals in the President's budget. An early step in congressional work on revenue legislation is publication by CBO of its own estimates (developed in consultation with the Joint Committee on Taxation) of the revenue impact of the President's budget proposals.\nRevenue totals agreed to in a budget resolution can be used to establish the framework for subsequent action on revenue measures. A budget resolution, however, contains only revenue totals and total recommended changes; it does not allocate these totals among revenue sources, nor does it specify which provisions of the tax code are to be changed.\nThe House and Senate may consider revenue measures under their regular legislative procedures, such as the chambers did for the Tax Reform Act of 1986. However, changes in revenue policy may also be made in the context of the reconciliation process (described in a separate section of this report), such as the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2015.\nSpending Legislation\nCongressional budgetary procedures distinguish between two types of spending: discretionary spending (which is controlled through the annual appropriations process) and direct spending (also referred to as mandatory spending, for which the level of funding is controlled outside of the annual appropriations process). Discretionary and direct spending are both included in the President's budget and the congressional budget resolution, and they both provide statutory authority for agencies to enter into obligations for payments from the Treasury. The two forms of spending, however, are distinct in most other respects in terms of both their formulation and consideration. There are some notable exceptions to these distinctions, however, so that some procedures associated with direct spending are applied to particular discretionary spending programs and vice versa.\nFormulation. The basic unit for appropriations legislation is the spending account. In modern practice, regular appropriations legislation is drafted as unnumbered paragraphs that provide a lump-sum amount for each appropriations account. This lump sum provides a definite amount of budget authority that is available to finance activities or programs covered by that account for a certain period of availability for certain purposes consistent with statutory requirements or limitations. In many cases, appropriations for an agency may be provided in relatively few broad accounts, such as for \"salaries and expenses,\" \"operations,\" or \"research.\" Direct spending, on the other hand, characteristically provides budget authority in the form of a requirement to make payments to eligible individual recipients according to a formula that establishes eligibility criteria and a program of benefits. The resulting overall level of outlays would be an aggregation of obligations for these individual benefits. In some cases (termed \"appropriated entitlements\"), appropriations legislation may be used to provide the means of financing, but, in practice, the requirements for funding such programs are determined through their authorizing legislation so that the Appropriations Committees have little or no discretion as to the amounts they provide.\nCommittee j urisdiction. The Appropriations Committees have jurisdiction over discretionary spending for federal agencies and programs. In contrast, legislative committees (such as the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions or the House Agriculture Committee), have jurisdiction over direct spending programs (including those funded in annual appropriations acts) through their jurisdiction over legislation concerning the structure of direct spending programs and their formulas regarding eligibility criteria and program of benefit payments.\nFrequency of d ecision m aking. Discretionary spending is provided in regular appropriations bills that are characteristically considered on an annual schedule. With some exceptions, budget authority provided in these measures is available for obligation only during a single fiscal year. Direct spending programs are typically established in permanent law that continues in effect until such time as it is revised or terminated, although in some cases (such as the Child Health Insurance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) the program may need periodic reauthorization. The scheduling for consideration of legislation making such changes is determined by congressional leadership through their agenda-setting authority rather than keyed to the beginning of the fiscal year.\nEnforcing s pending l evels in the b udget r esolution. The procedures Congress uses to enforce the policies set forth in the annual budget resolution differ somewhat for discretionary and direct spending programs. For both types of spending, Congress relies on allocations made under Section 302 of the 1974 CBA to ensure that new spending legislation reported by House and Senate committees conforms to parameters established in the budget resolution. Although this procedure is effective in limiting consideration of new legislationâboth annual appropriations measures and new entitlement legislationâit is not an effective means for controlling direct spending that results from existing laws. Changes to the level of direct spending requires the enactment of new legislation that would change formulas regarding eligibility criteria and program of benefit payments, either through the regular legislative process or some expedited procedure such as reconciliation (described in a later section of this report).\nStatutory c ontrols. Discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021 is subject to spending limits set in the Budget Control Act, as revised. These spending limits are divided into separately enforced amounts for defense and nondefense. Direct spending is not capped, but new direct spending (or revenue) legislation is subject to the Statutory Pay-as-You-Go Act of 2010. This act requires that the net effect of direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for a fiscal year not cause the deficit to rise or the surplus to decrease over specified periods of time.\nThe Budget Cycle\nFor any given fiscal year, federal budgeting is often viewed as a cyclical activity that begins with the formulation of the President's annual budget request and concludes with the audit and review of expenditures spreading over a multiyear period. The main stages are formulation and submission to Congress of the President's budget; congressional consideration of budgetary measures, including the budget resolution, appropriations legislation, and other measures as necessary to establish statutory spending and revenue requirements; budget execution; and finally audit and review. While the basic steps continue from year to year, particular procedures and timing can vary in accordance with the President or Congress, as well as various other economic and political considerations.\nThe budget cycle can be discussed within the context of the calendar year, the congressional session, and the fiscal year. The calendar year and congressional sessions exist largely side by side. Since the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the President has been required to submit his budget request for the next fiscal year at the beginning of the calendar year. Furthermore, since the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1933, congressional sessions have begun on January 3 (unless a law is enacted setting a different day). Together, these two factors mean that the consideration of budgetary matters by Congress for the upcoming fiscal year is generally expected to start near the beginning of the calendar year.\nSince FY1977, the federal fiscal year has been October 1 through September 30, as set by the CBA. Because appropriations legislation typically provides budget authority to be obligated over the course of a single fiscal year, the focus of congressional action in the budget cycle is the consideration and enactment of new annual appropriations legislation before the expiration of prior enacted appropriations (although this process often stretches beyond the beginning of the fiscal year). This focus on the upcoming fiscal year (referred to as the budget year) is reflected in the President's budget proposal and budget resolution as well. Direct spending or revenue legislation, however, may have effective dates that are different from the beginning of the fiscal year.\nIn addition, Section 300 of the CBA establishes a timetable with respect to target dates for certain actions in the congressional budget process.\nThe budget process, however, is not just about a single fiscal year. While the focus for Congress is legislation pertaining to the upcoming fiscal year, it may also need to address legislation, such as supplemental appropriations for disaster relief, affecting the fiscal year in progress or long-term budget planning. Federal agencies also typically deal with multiple fiscal years at the same time: auditing of completed fiscal years, implementing the budget for the current fiscal year, seeking funds from Congress for the upcoming fiscal year, and planning for fiscal years after that. Taken as a whole then, budgetary activities from planning to execution related to the funding for a fiscal year can actually stretch over an extended period of two-and-a-half calendar years (or longer).\nThe Executive Budget Process: Formulation and Content of the President's Budget\nThe Constitution does not assign a formal role to the President in the federal budget process. It was largely left for agencies to develop and submit their own budget estimates to Congress individually. Although some Presidents made attempts to coordinate or limit agency budget estimates before they were communicated to Congress, such attempts were intermittent and uneven. This was changed by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which created a statutory role for the President in federal budgeting by establishing a framework for a consolidated federal budget proposal to be developed by the President and submitted to Congress prior to the start of each fiscal year. By barring agencies from submitting their budget requests directly to Congress, and making the President responsible for a consolidated budget request, the act altered the institutional responsibilities of the office. The President's budget submission reflects the President's policy priorities and offers a set of recommendations regarding federal programs, projects, and activities funded through appropriations acts as well as any proposed changes to revenue and mandatory spending laws.\nUnder current law, the President is required to submit a budget to Congress no later than the first Monday in February prior to the start of the fiscal year, but preparation typically begins at least nine or 10 months prior to that, approximately 18 months before the start of the fiscal year. OMB coordinates the development of the President's budget by issuing various circulars, memoranda, and other guidance documents to the heads of executive agencies. In particular, OMB Circular No. A-11 is issued annually. It is an extensive document that provides agencies with an overview of applicable budgetary laws, policies for the preparation and submission of budgetary estimates, and information on financial management and budget data systems. Circular A-11 also provides agencies with directions for budget execution and guidance regarding agency interaction with Congress and the public.\nWhen agencies begin work on the budget for a forthcoming fiscal year, Congress has not yet made final determinations for the next year. Consequently, agencies must begin the process of developing their budget estimates with a great deal of uncertainty about future economic conditions, presidential policies, and congressional actions. Agency requests are typically submitted to OMB in late summer or early fall and are reviewed by OMB on behalf of the President. Under the Government Performance and Results Act, agencies are required to link the formulation of their budgets with government performance through strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. OMB notifies agencies of decisions regarding their budget and performance plans through what is known as the \"passback\" and are given an opportunity to make appeals to the OMB director and, in some cases, to the President. Once OMB and the President make final decisions, federal agencies and departments must revise their budget requests and performance plans to conform with these decisions.\nThe content of the budget submission is partly determined by law, but Title 31 authorizes the President to set forth the budget \"in such form and detail\" as he may determine. Over the years, there has been an increase in the types of information and explanatory material presented in the budget documents. In most years, the budget is submitted as a multi-volume set consisting of a main document setting forth the President's message to Congress and an analysis and justification of his major proposals. Additional supplementary documents typically provide account and program level details (the \"Budget Appendix\"), historical information (\"Historical Tables\"), and special budgetary analyses (\"Analytical Perspectives\"). The latter volume includes multiyear budget estimates that project spending and revenues where current policies are continued (called the \"current services baseline\") as well as spending and revenues under the President's proposed policy changes, among other things.\nIn support of the President's appropriations requests, agencies prepare additional materials, frequently referred to as congressional budget justifications. These materials provide more detail than is contained in the President's budget documents and are used in support of agency testimony during Appropriations subcommittee hearings on the President's budget.\nThe President is also required to submit a supplemental summary of the budget, referred to as the Mid-Session Review, before July 16 of each year. The Mid-Session Review is required to include any substantial changes in estimates of expenditures or receipts, as well as any changes or additions to proposals made in the earlier budget submission. The President may also submit other supplemental requests or revisions to Congress at other times during the year.\nThe Congressional Budget Process\nUntil the 1970s, congressional consideration of the multiple budgetary measures considered every year lacked any formal coordination. Instead, Congress considered these various spending and revenue measures separately, sometimes informally comparing them to proposals in the President's budget. That was changed by the CBA of 1974. The CBA provides for the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget, allowing Congress to make decisions about overall fiscal policy and priorities as well as to coordinate and establish guidelines for the consideration of various budget-related measures. This budget resolution sets aggregate budget policies and functional priorities for the upcoming budget year and for at least four additional fiscal years. In recent practice, budget resolutions have often covered a 10-year period.\nBecause a concurrent resolution is not a law, the President cannot sign or veto it, and it does not have statutory effect, so no money can be raised or spent pursuant to it. The main purpose of the budget resolution is to establish the framework within which Congress considers separate revenue, spending, and other budget-related legislation. Revenue and spending amounts set in the budget resolution establish the basis for the enforcement of congressional budget policies through points of order . The budget resolution may also be used to initiate the reconciliation process for conforming existing revenue and direct spending laws to congressional budget policies (described below).\nThe Annual Appropriations Process\nDiscretionary spending is provided through a characteristically annual process in which Congress enacts regular appropriations measures. As an exercise of their constitutional authority to determine their rules of proceeding, both chambers have adopted rules that facilitate their ability to define and provide for consideration of these measures. One fundamental aspect of this has been to limit appropriations to purposes authorized by law. This requirement allows Congress to distinguish between legislation that addresses only questions of policy and that which addresses questions of funding and to provide for their separate consideration. In common usage, the terms used to describe these types of measures are authorizations and appropriations , respectively.\nAn authorization may generally be described as a statutory provision that defines the authority of the government to act. It can establish or continue a federal agency, program, policy, project, or activity. Further, it may establish policies and restrictions and deal with organizational and administrative matters. It may also, explicitly or implicitly, authorize subsequent congressional action to provide appropriations. By itself, however, an authorization of discretionary spending does not provide funding for government activities.\nAn appropriation may generally be described as a statutory provision that provides budget authority, thus permitting a federal agency to incur obligations and make payments from the Treasury for specified purposes, usually during a specified period of time.\nThe authorizing and appropriating tasks are largely carried out by a division of labor within the committee system and preserved under House and Senate rules. Legislative committeesâsuch as the House Committee on Armed Services and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportationâare responsible for authorizing legislation related to the agencies and programs under their jurisdiction. Most standing committees have authorizing responsibilities. The Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate have jurisdiction over appropriations measures, including annual appropriations bills, supplemental appropriations bills, and continuing resolutions.\nThe Executive Budget Process: Budget Execution\nAfter enactment of a particular appropriation into law, federal agencies must attempt to interpret and apply its terms in order to execute their budgetary responsibilities. Agencies may generally obligate and expend funds subject to any conditions addressed by appropriations statutes guided by three general principles:\nthe purpose(s) for which particular funds are appropriated, which may be expressed in statute in more or less detail and, in some cases, with certain restrictions; the time period during which funds are available for obligation and expenditureâsometimes referred to as the period of availability or duration of appropriations; and the amount of appropriated funds that may be obligated and expended.\nWithin the contours of these statutory conditions on the availability of funds, agencies may nevertheless exercise some discretion regarding how funds are allocated and the pace at which funds are obligated and spent. \n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Melvin Rowland, 37, demanded that Lauren McCluskey send him money to stop him from doing so, authorities said Thursday. \n \n Rowland, 37, had been lurking on campus for days trying to confront the woman who had broken up with him weeks earlier when she discovered his criminal background, university police chief Dale Brophy said. Rowland spent the hours before the fatal shooting Monday in McCluskey's dorm building socializing with her friends, university police chief Dale Brophy said. \n \n He later confronted the 21-year-old McCluskey in the parking lot, dragged her into a car and shot her multiple times in the back seat, Brophy said at a news conference. \n \n Rowland killed himself hours later in a church as police closed in. \n \n The killing of McCluskey, a track athlete at the school, came weeks after she broke off her month-long relationship with Rowland and filed a complaint with campus police alleging he had demanded money in exchange for not posting compromising pictures of the couple online. She had sent $1,000 to an account in hopes of preserving her reputation, Brophy said. \n \n Police were investigating the case as sexual extortion and knew Rowland was a sex offender but not that he was on parole, Brophy said. \n \n NEW in @UUtah student death \n \n Police say... \n \n -Lauren McCluskey paid Melvin Rowland $1000 to keep compromising photos private \n \n -He was on campus Fri to Mon, looking for McCluskey \n \n -He texted her, posing as cop Monday AM to lure her outside \n \n -He went on date (dinner, shower) after murder — Michael Locklear (@MichaelLocklear) October 25, 2018 \n \n McCluskey reported receiving numerous emails and messages using different names trying to lure her to locations. Investigators now believe they all came from Rowland, who Brophy called a master manipulator. \n \n After shooting McCluskey, Rowland was picked up on campus by a woman he met online. They went to dinner, visited the state Capitol and went to her apartment where Rowland took a shower. \n \n Later that night, after the woman dropped Rowland at a coffee shop, police tracked him to the church where he killed himself. \n \n The woman had called police when she saw photos of the man being sought for the campus shooting. \n \n Rowland got the gun by telling an acquaintance that his girlfriend wanted to learn to shoot. \n \n Brophy said it appears the woman who picked up Rowland on campus and the person who loaned him the gun had been duped and are not expected to face charges. \n \n \"Rowland was a manipulator. If his lips were moving, he was lying,\" Brophy said. \"I don't think he told the truth to anybody based on our investigation.\" \n \n Kaitlin Felsted, a spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Corrections, said police didn't make parole officers aware of the complaint filed by McCluskey. \n \n Brophy said police didn't start the formal extortion investigation until six days after her Oct. 13 report due to workload issues. \n \n In the early stages of the investigation, they didn't have enough information to pass on to any other law enforcement, Brophy said, adding that there were no indications from McCluskey that Rowland was threatening physical violence. \n \n University of Utah president Ruth Watkins said outside investigations are being launched to assess campus security and police protocols to determine if improvements can be made to prevent future shootings. \n \n Watkins said so far she has found no mistakes in how police handled the case. Brophy said he welcomes the reviews. \n \n Gov. Gary Herbert said corrections and parole officials had approved independent investigations into the handling of Rowland's parole. \n \n \"Clearly in hindsight, we're going to say, 'You should have done this, you should have done that,'\" Herbert said during his monthly televised news conference at KUED-TV \n \n He noted, however, \"You never know when these things are going to occur.\" \n \n Rowland was paroled in April when he told the parole board that he was a changed man after being a peer leader in prison had helped him tap into his empathy and learn to follow the rules. \n \n He spent nearly a decade in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to trying to lure an underage girl online and attempted sex abuse charges, according to court records. \n \n After he was charged, a woman came forward to report he had sexually assaulted her after a separate online meeting a few days earlier. \n \n Rowland, a native of New York, was twice sent back to prison for parole violations that included possessing pornography and failure to complete therapy. \n \n He blamed his \"thinking errors\" for the actions that kept sending him back in prison, according to recordings of parole hearings from 2010 to 2018 released this week by the Utah Board of Parole and Pardons. \n \n Rowland said at a hearing in 2012 that he was a womanizer who manipulated women to get what he wanted. \n \n Brophy offered the same assessment. He said McCluskey met Rowland at a bar where he was working security and started dating him. He visited her often in her dorm and made friends with other students in the building. \n \n \"He was very, very good at getting people to trust him,\" Brophy said. \"Lauren was no different.\" \n \n Watkins said she gave McCluskey's parents a posthumous degree for their daughter, a senior from Pullman, Washington, who was majoring in communication. \n \n Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell paid tribute to McCluskey by writing her name on his sneakers before Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets. \n \n \"It was a scary feeling to be close to that. It's just so sad,\" Mitchell told NBA TV after the game. \"I have a little sister. My mom raised me. Women have to be protected more. She was being harassed for two straight weeks. That's so tough. She was defenseless. She couldn't do anything about it. For a man to do that, that's terrible. For me, I just wanted to be able to dedicate this game to her and her family.\" ||||| In the wake of the fatal shooting of student-athlete Lauren McCluskey on campus Monday evening, the University of Utah will initiate a pair of separate reviews into campus safety and how the university police department responded to a complaint from McCluskey about her killer earlier this month. \n \n \"Let me be clear: I have great faith that our university police department worked diligently on this incident,\" university president Ruth Watkins said. \"They too welcome an independent review. We will leave no stone unturned in determining anything we can do to prevent something like this from happening again on our campus.\" \n \n Melvin Rowland, 37, a convicted sex offender who was free on parole, dated McCluskey, a member of the Utah track and field team, for about a month after they met at a bar where he worked as a bouncer, University of Utah police chief Dale Brophy said Thursday at a news conference. McCluskey ended the relationship Oct. 9, after learning about Rowland's criminal background. In the days following the breakup, Rowland attempted to extort McCluskey and stalked her residence before assaulting her in a parking lot and shooting her several times in the back seat of a car, Brophy said. She was 21. \n \n Rowland killed himself hours later in a church as police closed in. \n \n Rowland was convicted of forcible sexual abuse and enticing a minor, both felonies, in 2004 in Utah. On Oct. 9, when McCluskey became aware of his background, she invited him to her dorm to confront him and end the relationship, Brophy told reporters. He said McCluskey allowed Rowland to stay with her that night and borrow her car the next day. \n \n Lauren McCluskey, a member of Utah's track and field team, was shot and killed Monday evening on campus. University of Utah Athletics \n \n On Oct. 10, McCluskey's mother, Jill McCluskey, a professor at Washington State University, contacted campus police dispatch because she was worried her daughter would be forced to go alone to retrieve her car from Rowland. \n \n Police made contact with Lauren McCluskey, but she told them she did not feel uncomfortable having Rowland drop off her car, Brophy said. Police later provided an escort for McCluskey after Rowland dropped her car off in a parking lot several blocks from her dorm. \n \n Two days later, McCluskey began receiving suspicious messages she believed were from Rowland and/or his friends, and she contacted police, Brophy told reporters. She told police the messages didn't make her feel uncomfortable, but told them Rowland's friends were trying to lure her somewhere and she didn't know why, Brophy said. Police later determined Rowland likely was responsible for all the messages McCluskey received. \n \n Then, on Oct. 13, she received a demand for money in order to prevent compromising photos of her and Rowland from being published on the internet, and she met the demand by depositing $1,000 in an account, Brophy said. McCluskey filed a report and university police opened an extortion case against Rowland, but the formal investigation did not begin until Oct. 19 due to workload issues, Brophy said. \n \n Brophy also said the department knew Rowland was a registered sex offender but was not aware Rowland was on parole. In the early stages of the investigation, the police did not have enough information to pass on to any other law enforcement agency, Brophy said, adding that there were no indications from McCluskey that Rowland was threatening physical violence. \n \n Editor's Picks Utah track athlete McCluskey shot and killed University of Utah track athlete Lauren McCluskey was shot and killed Monday night, the school announced. \n \n Utah athlete's killer a self-described manipulator The man who killed Utah track athlete Lauren McCluskey said he sought to manipulate those he met in person or online, according to a recording of his 2012 parole hearing. 1 Related \n \n Rowland was granted parole on Feb. 20 and released in April, public records show. Rowland's address was available on the sex offender database and he was required to check in monthly, according to Kaitlin Felsted, a public information officer for the Utah Department of Corrections. Rowland was last in touch with his parole officer by phone on Oct. 16, and the conversation did not raise any red flags, Felsted said. \n \n Rowland was granted parole on two prior occasions -- in 2012 and 2016 -- but violated the conditions of his release on both occasions and was returned to prison, according to the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole. During one parole hearing, he described himself as a womanizer who manipulated women to get what he wanted and said he was attracted to teenage girls and vulnerable women, and sought to manipulate those he met in person or online, according to a recording of the 2012 hearing released by Utah state authorities. \n \n Gov. Gary Herbert said corrections and parole officials had approved independent investigations into the handling of Rowland's parole. \n \n On the day of McCluskey's killing, Rowland spent several hours hanging out near her residence and attempted to lure her out of her dorm by sending a text message posing as a police officer, Brophy said. When she returned to her dorm, Rowland attacked McCluskey in the parking lot while she was on the phone with her mother and dragged her to the car, where he shot her several times, the chief said. \n \n According to Brophy, Rowland obtained the gun from an acquaintance, whom he told his girlfriend wanted to learn how to shoot. The acquaintance reached out to police voluntarily upon seeing news reports about the shooting and is cooperating with police, Brophy said, but it remains possible the individual could face criminal charges down the line. \n \n After shooting McCluskey, Rowland was picked up by a woman he had recently met on a dating website, Brophy said. They had dinner and went to her apartment, where Rowland showered before leaving. That woman contacted police when she saw Rowland's name in news reports about the shooting and is not expected to face charges, Brophy said. \n \n The external, independent reviews of campus safety measures and the police department's handling of the case will begin as soon as possible, Watkins said. As of Thursday evening, the university had not announced who would lead those reviews. ||||| A University of Utah student who police say was murdered by her ex-boyfriend told officers she wired $1,000 to an account earlier this month to prevent the release of \"compromising pictures\" of the pair, investigators said Thursday. \n \n University Police Chief Dale Brophy told reporters that Lauren McCluskey, 21, reported the extortion to his officers on Oct. 13, nine days before she was found shot dead outside an on-campus dormitory. The suspect in her murder, 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, was found dead that same evening of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a Salt Lake City church. \n \n Brophy said that McCluskey had ended her relationship with Rowland on Oct. 9 after she discovered that he had lied to her about his age and was a registered sex offender. McCluskey initially declined police assistance in dealing with Rowland, but later reported receiving numerous emails and messages using different names trying to lure her to locations in addition to the extortion attempt. Investigators now believe the messages all came from Rowland, who Brophy called a master manipulator. \n \n \"If his lips were moving, he was lying,\" Brophy said of Rowland. \"I don't think he told the truth to anybody based on our investigation.\" \n \n Rowland was spotted on surveillance video at various locations around the University of Utah's campus during the weekend before McCluskey's murder.

Following the breakup, Rowland engaged in various manipulative tactics, including sending compromising pictures of McCluskey and demanding $1,000 to prevent their public release. McCluskey reported this extortion attempt to campus police on October 13th, but a formal investigation was not initiated until six days later due to workload issues.\n\nUniversity Police Chief Dale Brophy stated that police were aware Rowland was a registered sex offender but were unaware he was on parole. Brophy also admitted that officers did not have enough information in the early stages of the investigation to share with other law enforcement agencies and that McCluskey had not indicated Rowland was physically threatening.\n\nIn the days leading up to the murder, Rowland was seen on campus surveillance footage lurking around McCluskey's dormitory. On the day of the murder, he confronted McCluskey in the parking lot while she was on the phone with her mother, dragged her into a car, and shot her multiple times.

She stated that no mistakes had been found in the police handling of the case, but welcomed the external reviews.\n\n\n\nKey details from the article include:\n\n* **McCluskey's age and status:** A 21-year-old University of Utah track athlete\n* **Rowland's age and criminal history:** A 37-year-old convicted sex offender on parole\n* **Date of the murder:** October 22nd, 2018\n* **Extortion amount:** $1,000\n* **Date of extortion report to police:** October 13th, 2018\n* **Start date of formal extortion investigation:** October 19th, 2018\n\nNotable quotes from individuals involved:\n\n* **University Police Chief Dale Brophy:** “If his lips were moving, he was lying. I don't think he told the truth to anybody based on our investigation.”\n* **Gov. Gary Herbert:** \"Clearly in hindsight, we're going to say, 'You should have done this, you should have done that,' … You never know when these things are going to occur.\"\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the need for thorough investigations into campus safety, police protocols, and the parole system to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future.\n"}
{"id": "summarization_032", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nWell, would you look at that: I’m still way too into this show. Is my title vague enough to not spoil things for casual readers? Here's hoping. \n This is mostly about  how  Pablo and Kelly told Ash and Evil Ash apart and what the limits are on the Evil Dead’s ability to mimic loved ones. \n Still just based on the original films and show, and definitely,  definitely  not accountable for Episode 10. Don’t make a liar out of me, Ep. 10. \n \n The Deadites have total access to the victim’s mind. \n \n I’m talking active thoughts and memories. Deadites essentially mind-read. You see it through the show with Kelly’s mom remembering what her family likes to eat – and the grade she teaches, and her favourite book, and probably lots of other little details. Deadite Roper ‘remembers’ that he hates Ash. In Evil Dead 2, there’s Deadite Henrietta singing Annie her childhood lullaby. Where it gets into ‘total access’ territory is seen with Evil Ash once the jig is up. Amanda might have mentioned the Deadites killing her partner, but there weren’t any on-screen details shared beyond that. In Ep. 8 though, Evil Ash still somehow says, “This is how your partner felt when he was dying.” \n Around the same time, Linda’s head is all, “Wtf, Ash, where’s Jackonsville?” Aside from being a severed head without a brain for Deadites to pick through, Ash’s only mention of this place is during his drug trip. Marry that to the idea that  as  Ash is crushing Linda’s skull with a crowbar, it crumbles into dust simultaneously. This show does not shy away from gore or the leftovers from fights (check out that diner’s meat slicer), so what the simultaneous crumbling and instant reset to a dusty skull tells me is that Linda never actually regained her flesh and blood. It happened in Ash’s head. He  saw  her as flesh and blood because the whole image was planted in his mind like a walking hallucination, just like the Fun Cabin Party Mental Breakdown from Evil Dead 2. El Jefe or not, the Deadites can get to him. \n \n Deadites only mimic what the victim knows. \n \n The problem is the victims know a lot. Kelly’s mom is possessed in Ep. 2. At the table, we have five people: Ash, Pablo, Kelly, the mom, and the dad. Forget Ash; the guy’s in his own class of Deadite perception. Instead, check out Kelly and her dad’s reactions. They swear up and down that this is the real mom, and eventually Pablo’s convinced. He can’t not be; what leg does he have to stand on to challenge the woman’s husband and daughter? What’s he gonna say? “Excuse me, I think I know your mom and wife better than you do, thanks”? There’s no proof, and only assholes would push that with no proof. \n In Evil Dead 1, we’ve got another five: Ash again, then Linda and Cheryl, Scotty, and The Other One. Scotty and The Other One are dating. Linda is Ash’s girlfriend and Cheryl is Ash’s  sister  (not that you’d know for all the time Ash spends talking about her in AvED). If you split them like this, into teams of familiarity, then in order to convince the group, you’d only have to convince the main expert. Since Linda and Cheryl get mimicked, that’s Ash. Like Kelly and her dad, if  Ash  says they’re the real deal (“That’s my sister and my girlfriend, I would know”), what can Scotty and Shelly say? Same with Henrietta and Annie – except Annie called bullshit – and Amanda when she squared off against her partner of ten years in Ep. 1. Everyone mimicked has been mimicked  to  somebody who can confidently say ‘yes, you are real’ or ‘please diddle yourself’. \n \n Ash forgot Kelly was Jewish. \n \n This should be fun. \n So Ash has this weird thing where he’s – like… not racist? But is? Kinda? He’s very much a product of the 80s, where he knows what he’s saying could be ‘bad’, but he doesn’t mean that way so he’ll clarify that it’s a compliment or not even race-based to start with, which makes it okay! :D Then he still freaking says it. He’s ‘positively’ racist (that’s still bad; kids, it’s 2016, and Ashley Williams is a relic, not a role model), which you see a few times throughout the show. The churro thing in the car at the bookstore, whatever Lem says around Amanda that Ash is like, “I totally didn’t know what that meant before, I get it now, my bad, I’m sorry”, and there was him prefacing the ‘Chicks are like that’ bit with, “I know it’s not PC these days,  but …” \n He knows Pablo isn’t white (and that’s the most he knows). He’s perfectly aware Amanda is black. He’s made enough references to that during the show. Hasn’t  reeeeally  said anything about the Jewish demographic. Certainly not in the first five episodes leading up to this one. More than that, the thought Kelly might not be a WASP never entered his mind initially. In Ep. 2, he makes the crosses to bury Kelly’s parents and is more or less caught off-guard by the revelation. He then promptly goes on with his life without another hint towards it. The reason I wrote ‘active thoughts and memories’ in the first point is because, at the very least, this detail is the farthest thing from his mind when he’s in the shaman shack with a Eligosed-up Kelly. \n Which means it’s the farthest thing from  Eligos’  reach. \n \n Ash didn’t shoot Kelly. \n \n He was gonna. Straight up. Ep.5 was almost titled  Boomstick to the Face . But he didn’t, and this is our first encounter with the Evil’s limitations: they only know what you know, and Ash, according to the Brujo, is a dolt with a total lack of self-awareness. It’s the reason Kelly’s alive, because the one thing that breaks Eligos’ ruse right at the instant before the trigger was pulled is Ash going, “Crosses. Crosses… That sounds familiar. Didn’t something happen with Kelly and crosses already? Something about her paren- aw that’s right! ” \n I’m taking it for granted that Eligos and the Deadites are cut from the same cloth. There’s a lot of duplication in what they do, and many of their differences are explainable as, “Oh, Eligos only possesses one person at a time ‘cause he’s a lesser demon.” The screwing with people, the psychological torment, the gunning it for Ash, and most importantly, the playing pretend to be Kelly all match up with what Deadites do. For the sakes of this, he’s got the same access to Ash’s mind as any Deadite – which, like I said, is a full backstage pass. \n As far as if Ash  could  shoot Kelly goes, yes. He promises in Ep. 6 that he’d cut off their heads if they were possessed, and he kind of even tells Pablo to shoot her in the trailer when she’s jumping around (Ash’s “That’s not Kelly!” line). Does he want to? No. At the shaman shack, there’s a switch between Kelly-Eligos (Kelligos) saying, “Ash, you know have to do this,” to “It’s okay, you’re doing the right thing.” That’s not something that’s said to a stone-cold killer, but to somebody trying to work up the nerve and do a terrible necessity while at the risk of changing his mind and not shooting. Still, the fact that Kelligos was able to switch from coaxing to reassurance shows the decision was made. Ash would’ve done it. He had the gun aimed and everything. That ‘Fuck you’ he gives afterwards? Very sincere. \n \n Deadites mimic the victim’s perception of the person they’re mimicking. \n \n It should not come as a surprise that the Deadites take what their victims know out of the total access they have to the victim’s mind and create the most messed up, custom-tailored, personal hell they can drag someone through. Kelly’s mom going, “I killed myself to get away from you”? Amanda’s partner blubbering, “I need your help”?  Linda, all, “Boo-hoo, you can’t kill me, I’m scared”? It’s done to crank the emotional trauma to 11 while also physically torturing people. They’re out for souls, not just deaths. \n Two Deadites have started with an ‘uplifting’ angle: Kelly’s mom, who did the reunion business, and Evil Ash, who got damn far in convincing Amanda to run away with him. The other Deadites, given their circumstances, had to play the Don’t Kill Your Loved Ones card, but these two were at a position to  give  before they took. Kelly’s mom went the route of making the perfect dinner as the perfect host and all that, becoming an idealized version of what her daughter and husband remembered.  For some fucking reason  Amanda’s – like,  really  into Ash by Ep. 8, so she gets the idealized version of that. The difference between these two is that for Kelly’s mom to move into Murder Terror Mode, she has to drop the act and go full Deadite. Evil Ash doesn’t until Amanda’s stuck on the antlers, and that’s because her perception of Ash lets Evil Ash fit Murder Terror Mode as-is. \n I’m taking this moment to say that, for me, Ep. 8 was hands-down the best so far. Evil Ash was legitimately horrifying. The fridge attack? That was actually hard for me to watch. He beats the hell out of her, throwing her around, cleaves her (that pun tho), and acts like a sick monster out for blood. This is Ash like you’ve never seen, ‘cause it  is  Ash you’ve never seen. It’s an Ash that doesn’t exist except on paper (ha! Shawshank!); specifically, as an artist’s rendering of the man suspected for the murder of multiple trailer park people and who seems alarmingly involved with the forces responsible for murdering her partner, too. She’s known the real Ash for – what, a day? Enough to know that he cracks a few dumb jokes, doesn’t flinch at a pick-axe going through a Deadite’s eye, and takes pride in killing killers. If she’s  fucking inexplicably  able to like the real Ash enough in the short time they’ve known each other to get a little crush, then those other thoughts, the thoughts of him being murderous, have to be just as prevalent, if not stronger. \n Think about the Ash, Kelly, and Pablo dynamic. In Ep. 6, Ash is saying, “If you two come to the cabin, I’ll end up cutting your heads off.” In Ep. 7, he’s upping the ante to, “Everyone I’ve ever cared about dies there.” That’s seconds after Pablo says, “We’re basically a family.” Yeah.  Those  three are. Not Amanda, with whom – despite sticking with his ‘chop your head off’ speech – Ash has zero problem inviting along. Who cares? She’s new  instead of teaming up at the bookstore where she could have gotten to know them and  actually contributed to the plot beyond giving just Ruby the chance to say she’s a Knowby  and if she dies, it’s not like she’s Kelly or Pablo. She’s just hot. \n Compare the Evil Ash in Ep. 8, Amanda’s Evil Ash, to the one we get in Ep. 9. There’s a night-and-day difference. Amanda’s Evil Ash is threatening, vicious, morbid, and cruel. The Evil Ash we get when it’s him against Goody-Two-Shoes is like a mildly more serious Army of Darkness version. When Pablo and Kelly join the scene though, as the two people who’ve been with Ash since the start of the season and are doing this completely, utterly adorable surrogate family thing with him (leave me alone, I like it), suddenly Evil Ash is a goofball – or as much as the real Ash – and would totally be harmless if not for the fact that he’s trying to get Kelly and Pablo to shoot the real Ash. The conversation that plays out is literally ‘who do you think is more like the Ash you know’? \n You can stretch this over to Linda’s head where she’s taking these massive chunks out of Ash’s psyche, to Kelly’s mom being now horrified at herself for killing Kelly’s dad, to Annie’s mom acting soothing and motherly in a desperate time, or really to any Deadite mimicry. Why take  those  actions? Why  that  emotional angle? Because it’s what the person – the ‘expert’ you’re trying to convince – expects. \n \n Deadites can only access one mind at a time. \n \n This has never been a problem until Evil Ash. Leave it to his double to be the one to expose the Evil’s weakness. Before him, Deadites only had to convince the main expert (Ash for Linda and Cheryl, Annie for Henrietta, Amanda for her partner) that they were real deal. Everyone else would fall into place ‘cause no one could top that person’s familiarity with so-and-so. Alternatively, the Deadites had two experts who were matched in what they knew about who was being mimicked, like Kelly and her dad. On the off-chance the Momite said something only Kelly would know that dad didn’t and tried to second guess, it’s easy to say, “Oh, sweetie, that’s a mother-daughter thing. Of course I never told you!” And on the flip-side: “Kelly, I love you, but you know your dad and I have our private chats.” So easy, it probably  did  happen and they rationalized that for themselves. \n With Evil Ash in Ep. 9, we get a totally new situation: two people, Pablo and Kelly, arguably matched in terms of how  much  they know about Ash, but different in terms of  what . It’s an equal-but-separate situation. \n The exchange is quick, but goddamn, there are two important notes made during it. The first is the racism thing. Ash is like, “Piñata!” and Pablo goes, “Yeah, that’s right.” He’s giving one of the Ashes an all-clear:  this  is what Pablo expects as totally in line with his friend, box ticked, item crossed, move on to the next point. It’s Kelly who puts it back on the table by saying, “He’s not that subtle.” Well, shit. Now Evil Ash has an opportunity, where if he can ‘be racist too’, he’ll win. Pablo’s already convinced, but Kelly’s not. That means Kelly has a different perception of Ash. As the recipient of his I-Forgot-You-Were-Jewish award, this makes sense. She doesn’t have the experiences Pablo has and is therefore not an authority on how racist, subtly or otherwise, he can be. So, if Evil Ash does something to fit Kelly’s perception, like be kinda racist instead of just subtle (negatively rather than positively), that should get her on his side and keep Pablo as a ‘yes’. \n “Asian babies creep me out!” \n Ash isn’t racist against Asians. \n Pablo  knows  this. It’s the first thing he says when Ash asks afterwards. Evil Ash is able to give comparisons between Amanda and her partners’ deaths, Kelly’s mom is able to rocket through an Are You Really You quiz, Kelligos was able to reference Ash’s full burial routine, and Lionel – Deadite Lionel at the bookstore – was able to start calling out Ruby for who she really was (whatever that is). Deadites do details. With a full access pass to Pablo’s mind, it should’ve been the first thing Evil Ash looked up. Unless he wasn’t  in  Pablo’s brain, but in Kelly’s, who was the last person who spoke before Asian babies, and the person who doesn’t know that side of Ash well enough to say either way, only that she perceives him as more racist than he was at that moment. \n It fits that there’d be this difference between what Kelly knows and what Pablo knows, since Ash himself says they’ve both told him things they’ve exclusively told to him. Why not the other way around? Again, Pablo, not Kelly, knew the ‘not Asians’ thing. Going further, it’s a two-person replication of how Ash tripped up Kelligos. Ash is the special chosen dolt, so he’s able to ‘hide’ info from himself (and the Deadites), but it took such varying exposures to him, to the point that Kelly and Pablo disagreed over what he was actually like, and to do it without the internal rationalizations Kelly and her dad could do about her mom’s inconsistencies, to pull off what Ash did by himself. \n This second note is that this repeats in Kelly’s favour over Pablo’s. The contest’s clincher is Ash saying, “Just shoot us both,” which Kelly immediately reacts to. She says he takes the easy way out and that the only person he’d die for is himself, which…  I mean, think of what she’s seen of him: he’s refused to help her family, summoned a demon to ask for advice, got her possessed, tried to ditch them at the militia camp, and did something with the Necronomicon to say in Ep. 5 that he was 100% responsible for everything. Pablo thinks Ash is the Jefe on a mission, built him a new hand, said he’d be honoured to be beheaded by Ash, and brought up that ‘basically family’ thing. Kelly wants revenge. It’s Pablo who wants to help Ash. As much as it sucks so hard to say, Kelly is not in this to be Ash’s friend. Maybe despite herself, she’s warming up to him, but like Amanda had that terrifying version of his evil self, Kelly has a noticeably more severe idea of who Ash is. \n So Evil Ash can’t top ‘kill us both’ since it perfectly encompasses Kelly’s opinion, but not Pablo’s, and Ash didn’t seem to think that about himself, either. That’s my answer to why Evil Ash didn't say it first. He wasn’t in Kelly’s head – not until the racism thing, and then, just long enough to try convincing her. But Ash and Pablo are bros. It’s safe to say that while Ash thinks of Kelly as a younger him (and I think he’s being serious), he’s gotten along with Pablo better  and  has known Pablo for a longer amount of time. As far as he’s concerned – and his is the mind Evil Ash has been in between Amanda’s death until the start of this contest –  Pablo  is the ‘Ash expert’, and Pablo doesn’t share Kelly’s reaction to ‘kill us both’ ‘cause he doesn’t share her opinion of Ash. Evil Ash, having only one head to be in at a time, backed the wrong horse. Out of the three, Kelly apparently knows Ash where it counts, and I’d like to think Evil Ash’s nervous laugh is him realizing this. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

", "response": "\n\nThis blog post explores the intricacies of Deadites' mimicry abilities, drawing insights from the TV show \"Ash vs. Evil Dead.\" The author focuses on how Deadites access memories and knowledge through their victims' minds, limiting their ability to flawlessly impersonate loved ones.\n\nOne central argument centers on the limitations of a Deadite's access: it can only replicate what the victim knows. The author uses the example of Kelly's Jewish heritage, which Ash initially overlooks, demonstrating that Deadites don't possess knowledge beyond the victim's awareness.\n\nThe author also delves into the concept of Deadites' emotional manipulation. They explain that Deadites tailor their mimicry to exploit the victim's vulnerabilities, creating personalized nightmares. This is illustrated by Deadites assuming the appearance of deceased loved ones or exploiting existing emotional traumas.\n\nAnother key point discussed is the singular nature of a Deadite's possession. Unlike multiple victims simultaneously possessed in previous installments, the show depicts Deadites inhabiting one mind at a time.\n\nThe author analyzes a crucial scene involving Evil Ash confronting Kelly and Pablo. They argue Evil Ash, attempting to convince either Kelly or Pablo that he is the real Ash, ultimately falters because he lacks access to both their perspectives simultaneously. Kelly and Pablo hold differing views of Ash's personality, highlighting the limitations imposed by the single-possession rule.\n\nUltimately, the article concludes that Deadites are cunning manipulators, exploiting the victim's knowledge and vulnerabilities, but they are ultimately restricted by their reliance on the victim's mind. This constraint allows for moments of vulnerability and potential for overcoming the Deadite's deception.\n\nThe author weaves together detailed examples, character interactions, and analysis of specific scenes to support their arguments. They seamlessly blend humor and insightful observations, maintaining the author's original tone throughout the summary.\n"}

Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . Go ahead .\nMarketing: Okay . {vocalsound} I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nUser Interface: Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um {vocalsound} sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . That's about it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right . {vocalsound} I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm {disfmarker} I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And uh the detailed design {disfmarker} in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a {disfmarker} not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . {vocalsound} Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh {vocalsound} well um functional design um . Um do we have {disfmarker} um any ideas of of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just {disfmarker} you know , change channels is its main function .\nProject Manager: So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or {disfmarker} I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?\nUser Interface: Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nUser Interface: for {disfmarker} could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like {disfmarker} I don't actually know . {gap} But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ?\nProject Manager: I I think {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , r universal remote .\nUser Interface: Ye yeah .\nProject Manager: Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control ,\nMarketing: Huh . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ours too . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I think we're all in the same boat here . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .\nMarketing: Mm . Ch\nProject Manager: So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh\nMarketing: Like a tracking device ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: like a tracking device or or like a a {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Oh you can get those key {disfmarker} well you could whistle or make a noise\nProject Manager: It makes a noise ,\nUser Interface: and it'd beep .\nProject Manager: there's a button on the T_V_ that you press\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , mm .\nProject Manager: and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Be good .\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Do we want {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Just long .\nProject Manager: so they're kinda like long and rectangular .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Do we want something crazy ?\nUser Interface: Black usually .\nProject Manager: You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Lot more modern .\nProject Manager: A m a modern {disfmarker} so our remote should be {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: I think so . Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Maybe like user-friendly , like a little\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .\nUser Interface: People {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another {disfmarker} if it was in a ball ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nUser Interface: and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Um .\nIndustrial Designer: Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so there are always the {disfmarker} some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ?\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} yeah , so we want it to be sturdy ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: then it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um {disfmarker} So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um easy to find . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What else {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .\nMarketing: Mm . Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: That's more on the research end , but {disfmarker} the marketing .\nProject Manager: So marketing , you know , how {disfmarker} maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing {vocalsound} remote control out there .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences ,\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .\nUser Interface: Ye Small .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball ,\nUser Interface: {gap} I'd {disfmarker} I could draw sorta the ball idea .\nProject Manager: you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located .\nUser Interface: My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you {disfmarker} this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle {disfmarker} Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that {disfmarker} if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something {disfmarker} maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} But yeah .\nMarketing: Futuristic . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: That was that was a sorta simple idea I had\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: and then you know you could {gap} about {disfmarker} Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um {disfmarker} the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere ,\nUser Interface: Yeah . Maybe f yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .\nUser Interface: Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . Yeah . The idea {disfmarker} it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's that's {vocalsound} interesting of course ,\nUser Interface: that was just one idea though .\nIndustrial Designer: but that's of course a weak point , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: How would we go about um making you know {disfmarker} getting rid of our weak points ? What {disfmarker} I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Not to put you on the spot ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} E No no ,\nProject Manager: but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: uh uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: What did you say your title was again ?\nIndustrial Designer: N n\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You're the the Industrial Designer .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: so i b well ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: the point is that {vocalsound} well maybe {disfmarker} I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .\nUser Interface: Well I I suppose that things become {gap} design . But I mean i\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah .\nProject Manager: It's not new , it's not innovative , it's {disfmarker} you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: it's it's stable um .\nMarketing: 'Kay , I'll draw something . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So if {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: What ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: no , go ahead .\nMarketing: My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: l so . But maybe {disfmarker} I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know . {vocalsound} That's my idea .\nUser Interface: I think definitely doing something different\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: is a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like {vocalsound} suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .\nProject Manager: Something with a grip .\nMarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , with a grip .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Because even {disfmarker} I suppose even with the ball\nUser Interface: It still might be hard to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: it's {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .\nProject Manager: it might not be the easiest to hold onto um .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: So perhaps the the joystick {disfmarker} the the keyboard idea might work better .\nUser Interface: Like {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} True .\nUser Interface: It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That's fine .\nProject Manager: Uh {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You're the boss , you're {vocalsound} allowed to .\nIndustrial Designer: Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . So for that there's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay , so\nIndustrial Designer: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: unfortunately we've got about five minutes here {vocalsound} to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . Let's see here . What if we had what if we had not only um {disfmarker} say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . So the grip is {disfmarker} No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then {vocalsound} flat uh {disfmarker} And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .\nIndustrial Designer: The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?\nProject Manager: Mm , that's true .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's {disfmarker} don't make it too stable {vocalsound} uh .\nProject Manager: So we don't have it flip open . We just have a ball {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .\nIndustrial Designer: To the other design .\nProject Manager: Okay , so then we forget the ball .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It looks cool . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Looks cool though .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It looks cool , but it's really not {disfmarker} it's not functional um .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh {vocalsound} functional .\nProject Manager: So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um {disfmarker} Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you {vocalsound} had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Course then it's it's like the rectangular {vocalsound} again , only with a couple of jutting out points . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Right .\nProject Manager: But it's one-handed um .\nIndustrial Designer: Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: right ,\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not {disfmarker} probably not get a get away from some longer design .\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: 'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: You know , all\nProject Manager: because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do .\nIndustrial Designer: that dif batteries {disfmarker} right , and {disfmarker} Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back .\nProject Manager: Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work .\nIndustrial Designer: I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .\nProject Manager: More expensive and {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Course you can do that .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or {disfmarker} if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the {vocalsound} the buttons and stuff ,\nProject Manager: True .\nIndustrial Designer: but um it's rather about an instinctual thing ,\nUser Interface: Put it {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of {disfmarker} or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .\nUser Interface: Even if you designed it {disfmarker} in some {disfmarker} in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead ,\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nUser Interface: Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish .\nProject Manager: Are we out of time ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some {disfmarker} Are good ideas , what are not .\nIndustrial Designer: Let's .\nUser Interface: Does it say {disfmarker} what does it say for n\nIndustrial Designer: Obviously {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .\nProject Manager: Uh . Must finish now , so .\nUser Interface: T\nProject Manager: And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Great .\nProject Manager: Okay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next {vocalsound} time around , be a little bit more prepared .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And uh alright , good meeting .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} \n[Text End]\n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_035", "instruction": "You're a professional researcher. Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nearly breast cancer detection , accurate diagnosis , and personalized therapies have become goals of clinical medicine in the genomic era , and in the last few decades molecular genetics advances have contributed greatly to the development of those goals . the ability to identify genomic characteristics , determine copy number variations , or measure rna and mirna with a variety of technologies provided the medical field with tools to explore the molecular make up of any sample and compare physiologic and pathologic states from any human tissue .\nhowever , the accuracy of such techniques depends largely on the purity of the samples provided for analysis . at the same time\nmicrodissection techniques have increased the purity of samples , enabled us to study the earliest stages of disease development , and allow separation of different tissue constituents , for example , separating epithelial tissue from the surrounding stroma in a breast lesion .\na consequence of increased targeting ability is a corresponding decrease in the amount of nucleic acid available for research . in the breast cancer research field ,\nexamples of areas that deal with small lesions and limited samples are the study of breast carcinoma in situ which is a presumed precursor to invasive breast carcinoma and a growing clinical problem [ 1 , 2 ] and establishing the role of the stroma or myoepithelial cells in the development of pre - invasive and invasive lesions . some breast lesions like atypical ductal hyperplasia and flat epithelial atypia are of much interest to pathologists and clinicians as they are upgraded to carcinoma about 1020% of the time in subsequent studies ; however opportunities to study such lesions are limited because they are often discovered incidentally in biopsies , and therefore the amount of samples available for research is very small . in breast cancer research ,\ncorrelation of molecular characteristics with outcomes helps identify predictive and prognostic variables that are of great value in clinical practice , unfortunately , most of the time that information can only be obtained after lengthy periods of followup to record whether or not the outcome of interest develops .\nconversely , there are millions of ffpe samples worldwide , many associated with detailed clinical data that makes them a precious resource for survival studies and prognostic and predictive marker development .\ntherefore , technologies that can be used on ffpe tissues without being limited by the amount of sample are very valuable .\narray cgh ( acgh ) is being widely used to identify the areas of genomic gain and loss that occur in different types of lesions and offers high - throughput capability , high resolution , and precise mapping of aberrations [ 36 ] .\nseveral microarray platforms have been developed and used for acgh including cdna arrays [ 79 ] , oligonucleotide arrays [ 10 , 11 ] , bac arrays [ 1217 ] , and most recently snp arrays [ 1821 ] .\nunfortunately , in order to be useful in the molecular pathology lab , this type of molecular analysis requires an abundant supply of high - quality genomic dna from clinical specimens , not only for the array cgh analysis but also to validate results using an independent technique such as q - pcr .   to facilitate molecular analysis of small specimens , several methods of whole genome amplification\ndop - pcr has been modified and used for several different types of molecular analysis including chromosomal cgh [ 2428 ] , high - resolution ( hr- ) cgh [ 29 , 30 ] , genotyping [ 31 , 32 ] , loh analysis , mutation detection , array cgh [ 3537 ] and more recently for methylation profiling of trace amounts of dna [ 38 , 39 ] .\nalthough dop - pcr has been widely accepted as a method of whole genome amplification , it is known that it introduces amplification bias .\nwhile some have been successful using dop - pcr on ffpe tissues , others have found that dop - pcr is not well suited for archived specimen analysis .\nartifactual amplification at chromosomes 1p , 3 , 13q , and 16p as well as preferential amplification of shorter alleles   has been reported .\nconsider dop - pcr a useful amplification method if researchers monitor carefully storage conditions and accept a \nmultiple displacement amplification ( mda )   and modifications of mda such as restriction- and circularization - aided rolling circle amplification ( rca - rca )   and mda using the large fragment of bst dna polymerase   have been used on ffpe tissue as a method of wga for acgh [ 4648 ] .\nthe disadvantage of these methods , which employ a polymerase , is that they may not perform well with degraded dna extracted from ffpe tissues , and the efficiency and accuracy of mda vary with the cell type .\na recent review on the mda method using nonfixed samples reports that it introduced pronounced skewing when evaluating ribosomal rna . to deal with mda bias ,\nsome have suggested combining two mda reactions , one denatured and one nondenatured , aiding copy number analysis and subsequent genotyping .\nthe methods based on producing representative amplicons by ligation - mediated pcr ( lm - pcr ) [ 52 , 53 ] , balanced pcr amplification , and adaptor - ligation pcr of randomly sheared genomic dna ( prsg ) have all performed well for array cgh [ 44 , 54 , 55 ] where the random - primed amplification ( rpa ) has been used successfully with ffpe tissues for array cgh and found to be superior to degenerate oligonucleotide - primed amplification for array - based cgh .  \nother technologies recently marketed for whole genome amplification include a linker - adapted pcr - based proprietary kit that was shown to be superior to mda , dop - pcr , random priming , and rca - rca methods for ffpe samples , omniplex which reports good results on wga of ffpe tissue prior to snp analysis   and repli - g which is marketed as a wga kit that uses the previously known phi29 dna polymerase method and adds a ligation step prior to amplification . in 1999 , klein et al . published a ligation - mediated method of whole genome amplification paired with chromosomal cgh that was specifically designed for the analysis of genomes of single cells and\n( single - cell comparative genomic hybridization ) .this method has been used successfully for cgh analysis of ffpe specimens [ 41 , 60 ] and for cgh analysis of single cells [ 61 , 62 ] .\nscomp was found to be superior to dop - pcr for global amplification of very small amounts of dna from microdissected ffpe samples .\nwhile several groups have demonstrated that it is possible to perform wga on ffpe samples , few have critically assessed the resulting dna for reproducibility and fidelity of replication on a genome - wide scale .\nwe have tested several methods of wga , systematically analyzed their performance , and selected the two best performing , scomp and dop - pcr , for further assessment .\nthe degree of wga effect on identification of genomic alterations was quantified and compared between the methods .\nthis assessment is a necessary validation step of wga methods and , we believe , provides invaluable information for scientists using ffpe samples for acgh studies .\n20  g of genomic dna from the uacc-812 breast cancer cell line ( atcc , http://www.atcc.org/ ) was extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit ( qiagen , canada ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .\ndna from the cell line and human placenta was digested with 2.5 u each of rsai and alui restriction enzymes ( invitrogen ) in a final volume of 100  l .\nthe digested dna ranging in size from 100 to 10,000 base pairs was cleaned using the qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen , canada ) and quantitated using a dyna quant fluorometer ( amersham biosciences ) . for ffpe samples ,\nmultiple 5  m thick sections of paraffin blocks were deparaffinized and stained for 30  sec in haematoxylin prior to microdissection .\ntumor areas were isolated in a dissecting stereo microscope using 18 g needles and h&e - stained slides for guidance ( under supervision of a pathologist , s. j. done ) .\nmicrodissected tissue was incubated in lysis buffer for 72  hr , and dna was extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit .  \ndegenerate oligonucleotide primed ( dop- ) pcr was performed by two methods . first , using the dop - pcr master kit ( roche ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions ; second , according to the protocol of huang et al .\nbriefly , 10100  ng of genomic dna was amplified by thermo sequenase ( amersham biosciences ) in a low - stringency preamplification step ( 5 cycles ) , followed by regular pcr amplification in less stringent conditions .\nfor both methods , several replicate reactions were pooled together ( n = 57 based on the sample size , i.e , amount of material available ) and a negative control ( template : water ) was used to ensure absence of contamination .\nthe resulting amplified dna was purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen , canada ) and quantified using a dyna quant fluorometer ( amersham biosciences ) .\nthe initial steps of the scomp procedure were performed according to the protocol provided by dr .\ngenomic dna was digested with 2  u msei ( new england biolabs ) for 3 hours in one - phor - all buffer ( amersham ) in a final volume of 5  l .\nbase pairing of the adaptor nucleotides was done in a final volume of 3  l using 0.5  l one - phor - all buffer , 0.5   100  m lib1 oligonucleotide ( 5-agtgggattcctgctgtcagt-3 ) , and 0.5  l 100  m ddmse11 oligonucleotide ( 5-taactgacagcdd-3 ) in a mj research pt100 thermocycler programmed for a gradient of 65c to 15c ramped down at 1c per minute . 1  l t4 dna ligase ( 40  u/l ) ( roche ) , 1  l of 10  mm atp and the msei digested genomic dna was added and allowed to incubate at 15c overnight . for pcr amplification\nthe following was added to the ligation mix : 3  l expand long template buffer 1 ( roche ) , 2  l 10  mm dntps , 35  l h2o and 1  l expand - long - template polmix ( 3.5  u/l ) .\nthermocycler conditions were as follows : 1 cycle , 68c for 3  mins ; 15 cycles 40  sec at 94c ,\n30  sec at 57c , 1  min 30  sec + 1  sec / cycle at 68c ; 8 cycles 40  sec at 94c , 30  sec at 57c + 1c / cycle , 1  min 45  sec + 1  sec / cycle at 68c ; 22 cycles 40  sec at 94c , 30  sec at 65c , 1  min 53  sec + 1  sec / cycle at 68c ; 1 cycle 3  min 40  sec at 68c .\nseveral reactions were pooled together ( n = 57 as above ) . a negative control ( template : water )\nwas used for all steps to ensure there was no contamination . following pcr amplification ,\nthe resulting products were cleaned with the qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen , canada ) and quantitated using a dyna quant fluorometer ( amersham biosciences ) .\n2 - 3  g of dna was labelled by random priming ( bioprime dna labeling kit , invitrogen ) in 3 separate reactions with either cy3 or cy5\n. labeled products were mixed in appropriate combinations in dig easy hyb ( roche ) hybridization buffer and hybridized for 1624 hours at 37c in a humidified chamber in duplicate to the human 19  k single - spot cdna arrays from the clinical genomics centre , uhn ( university health network microarray centre , http://www.microarrays.ca/ ) , which contain 19,008 human ests / genes with map positions identified for ~11,000 cdna clones with the median distance between mapped positions 73.4 kb , where 93% of the clones spaced < 1 mb and 99% < 3 mb .\nthe photomultiplier gain for each laser was adjusted to give an average ratio of cy3 to cy5 of 1 and to minimize the number of saturated pixels .\nimages were then analyzed using the genepix pro 3.0 software ( axon instruments , usa ) .\neach subgrid on each array was independently normalized by equalizing the cy3 intensities with respect to the cy5 intensities , while excluding spots flagged as anomalous or absent by the quantifying software .\nlog2 ratios were assigned to each spot and the profiles were centered by the median value and scale normalized by the median of absolute values .\npcr was performed according to the abi7700 protocols using the quantitect sybr green pcr kit ( qiagen , canada ) .\ndna from normal placenta was used as reference and relative gene quantity was calculated by the delta - delta ct method .\nfirst , we tested wga methods using higher - quality dna from the uacc-812 cell line and human placenta .\nthree independent runs of dna from the cell line amplified by scomp and dop methods were compared by correlation with nonamplified controls ( pearson ) . since scomp was giving consistently better results , an additional five samples amplified by this technique were tested .\nthe data was summarized by a pseudocolor matrix generated using the matlab r12 ( mathworks inc , natick , ma , usa ) software to display pair - wise correlations among individual samples ( figure 1 ) .\nsignificance analysis of microarrays ( sam ; http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/sam/ )   was used to identify significantly amplified or deleted genes among the amplified and nonamplified datasets . a binary tree - structured vector quantization ( btsvq ; available at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~juris/btsvq/downloads.html )\nbtsvq combines a partitive k - means clustering and a self - organizing maps ( soms ) algorithm in a complementary way , to achieve clustering of both samples and genes .\na moving average of microarray data ( sliding window of 20 data points , figure 2 ) was used to search for genomic alterations previously reported in uacc-812 cells .\ninitially , three samples were amplified by scomp and dop methods and compared to nonamplified controls .\nthen , since scomp performed better , three additional samples amplified by scomp were added to the analysis .\nall profiles were analyzed by pearsons correlation of nonsegmented acgh data between amplified samples and corresponding nonamplified controls .\nwe also counted the number of individual cdna spots concordant as gain or loss between the test and corresponding control samples as well as between the duplicate runs of nonamplified control dna .\nadditionally , the profiles were analyzed as whole genomes by arranging clones in the genomic sequence ( national center for biotechnology information , build 201 and university of california , santa cruz , build hg18 ) and identifying genomic alterations by the circular binary segmentation algorithm (  dnacopy  package ver .\nduplicate runs of nonamplified control samples were used to establish reference values for each type of analysis .\nthe segmentation algorithm was used to identify contiguous segments of statistically uniform individual data points .\nthe segments of amplified samples and the segments of nonamplified controls were screened to identify regions of overlapping concordant gains and losses .\nthe lengths of the concordant regions were summed , and the percentage of concordantly identified genome length was calculated for each amplified sample .\nthen , peaks of genomic alterations were visualized by moving average as described above , and the peaks of amplified samples of the same sign and position as the peaks of control samples were recorded as concordant without restrictions for amplitude .\npercentages of concordant / discordant peaks were calculated per amplified sample .   we have evaluated four major pcr - based methods of wga and investigated their suitability for processing ffpe clinical samples .\nthe methods include two variations of dop - pcr [ 23 , 27 ] , scomp [ 41 , 59 ] , and t7-based linear amplification of dna ( tlad ) .\nwe did not investigate methods based on multiple displacement amplification ( mda ) using dna polymerase [ 43 , 45 , 46 ] , because the enzyme may not be suitable for ffpe clinical samples due to fragmentation of the template genomic dna .\nour preliminary tests eliminated two of the four methods . the dop - pcr master kit ( roche , mannheim , germany )\nperformed well with good - quality genomic dna from our cell line , however , failed to amplify genomic dna extracted from ffpe tissue .\nin addition , it was often subject to contamination in the negative control , which was of significant concern given the low quantities of genomic dna we expected to use ( as low as 10  ng ) .\nthe tlad protocol was laborious and costly , and there was significant loss of template dna in the initial steps due to many purification steps .\nalthough tlad did significantly amplify the amount of starting material up to 100x in our hands , the cgh arrays failed due to what appeared to be poor labeling efficiency of the resulting products . the remaining dop - pcr protocol and scomp performed well during preliminary tests and were further analyzed by acgh .   both modified dop - pcr and scomp performed equally well at amplifying genomic dna from cell lines as well as from ffpe material . starting with as little as 10  ng of genomic dna , we were able to get as much as 2 - 3  g from the modified dop - pcr protocol and scomp with products ranging in size from 10 to 10,000  bp , and 100 to 1,500  bp respectively .\nthe negative controls ( template : water ) in both cases showed little or no product formation . when product formation was detected in the negative control lane , the products from that experiment were not used for analysis .\nthe cells have been shown to harbor several regions of amplification including 1q , 8q , 13q , 17q , and 20q   and amplification of the dna topoisomerase ii ( top2 ) gene .\nour acgh profiles of control samples showed alterations of the expected regions , including those on chromosomes 1 , 8 , and 17 shown in figure 2 . to validate the microarray data by an independent molecular method\n, we performed q - pcr on 15 genes found to be amplified by corresponding cdna clones in amplified or nonamplified material , as well as 7 random genes .\nthe relative ratio of uacc-812 to placenta was calculated for cdna clones of acgh and compared to relative gene quantity determined by q - pcr . for nonamplified dna\n, loss / gain was confirmed in 18 out of 22 samples with correlation of absolute values r = 0.62 ( pearson ) , for scomp - amplified in 19/22 ( r = 0.75 ) , and 9/22 ( r = 0.22 ) in the dop - amplified experiments ( table 1 ) .\ninitially , we tested and compared dop and scomp methods using three samples in a group and then expanded the number of scomp amplified samples to further test the technique as it showed greater fidelity .\nscomp - amplified samples showed higher correlation with the nonamplified controls than dop - amplified samples . as expected , the self / self hybridizations of dna from placenta correlated well with each other and did not correlate with the nonamplified , scomp - amplified , or dop - amplified dna from uacc-812 cells .\nthe dop - amplified samples had the lowest correlation between each other and with the control samples .\nalthough nonsegmented profiles of both wga methods showed similar correlation with corresponding controls ( table 2 ) , there was a trend for a greater number of concordant spots within the scomp samples .\nthe mean percentage of cdna spots concordant with the controls for gain / loss assignment was 65.7 , 68.5 , and 71.7% for dop , scomp , and reference duplicate control runs , respectively , where difference between the groups was not statistically significant . among the cdna clones assigned discordantly opposite to the controls as gain or loss ,\nthere were clones discordant recurrently in all samples within the groups of scomp , dop , or duplicate control samples : 2.53 , 1.56 and 1.61% , respectively ( difference not significant ) . the difference with the log2 values of the control or duplicate runs was similar between the groups : 0.25 , 0.26 , and 0.21 , respectively ( difference not significant ) .\nsince the purpose of acgh is identification of regions of genomic gain or loss rather than values of individual cdna clones , we aimed to assess regions of gains / losses identified by segmentation and moving averages ( figure 3 ) .\nthe median number of segments per sample was similar between the groups : 41 , 40 , 41 , 37 for all , control , scomp , and dop samples , respectively , where the median number of segments of gain was 20 , 25 , 20 , 20 , and segments of loss 20 , 15 , 21 , 17 .\nthere was 42.5% genome length concordance between segments identified in dop and corresponding nonamplified controls , which were significantly lower than the 78.6% reference length concordance ( reference : duplicate runs of nonamplified samples , p < 0.01 , mann - whitney ) .\nfor the same ffpe samples , scomp - amplified dna showed segmentation patterns similar to the nonamplified controls with a concordance rate of 68.5% , which was not significantly different from the reference runs ( table 2 ) .\na similar advantage of the scomp method was observed by comparing peaks of genomic alterations : scomp samples had 84.4% concordant peaks compared to 72.2% of dop - amplified samples , where the latter was significantly lower than the reference concordance rate .\nto better assess the preferred wga amplification method , we added more samples to the scomp group . overall , 67.8% of detected segments and 84.4% of peaks identified in scomp amplified samples were concordant with those of nonamplified controls .\nour aim was to compare and validate whole genome amplification methods for acgh of microdissected ffpe tissue .\nscomp was particularly promising because it has been successfully used for analysis of single cells isolated from a breast cancer cell line , disseminated tumour cells in minimal residual cancer in the bone marrow , dna extracted from archival material , and circulating melanoma cells . in all cases there\ndop - pcr on the other hand is a well - established , technically straightforward method that is widely accepted as a method of wga .\ndop - pcr - generated dna has been used for many applications , including acgh [ 68 , 69 ] . in both of these publications\npreviously , stoecklein et al .   had shown that scomp was preferable to dop - pcr for use with formalin - fixed samples ; however , it was only validated using chromosomal cgh .\nwe compared the techniques and tested further the better performing method by a high - resolution acgh .   to initially test the methods , we used better - quality dna extracted from fresh samples and found scomp superior to dop - pcr ( figure 1 ) . to validate the acgh platform before further analysis , we used quantitative pcr ( q - pcr ) and tested 22 genes in the three groups of data  nonamplified , scomp - amplified , and dop - amplified .\nthe highest agreement was in the nonamplified and scomp - amplified datasets ( table 1 ) .\nthe profiles of the samples amplified by both techniques had similar correlation with the controls ; however , there was a trend for the dop group to have a higher percentage of discordant individual spots .\nonly a small proportion of the discordant spots were observed repeatedly within the samples of each group , which we interpreted as indication of the artifacts being predominantly random and not specific for cdna clone sequence , spot position within the array , or other factors specific for amplification method or the microarray platform .\nafter reliability of the acgh platform and amplification techniques were evaluated , we proceeded to experiments with ffpe specimens . in these experiments ,\nacgh analysis showed consistently better performance of the scomp technique compared to dop - pcr . since acgh has been successfully used in breast cancer research to characterize breast cancer cell lines and identify regions of common genomic alterations in different cancer subtypes [ 65 , 70 ] , we used current approaches of acgh analysis to study the effect of wga on accurate detection of alterations .\nthe segmentation algorithm we used has been successfully employed in multiple acgh studies [ 7173 ] and is becoming a routine tool for denoising acgh data from clinical samples .\nto avoid biases we intentionally did not use cut - offs to filter segments or peaks by the degree of significance .\nscomp showed higher fidelity and allowed identification of the genomic alterations detected in nonamplified samples by both segmentation and moving average analyses at rates close to the reference values .\nthe difference between median rates of the scomp and the reference group was 11% and 10% for the segmentation and moving average analyses , respectively .\nalthough they may serve as estimates of artifacts introduced by scomp amplification , the differences were not statistically significant .\nthe dop method showed significant alterations of the profiles introducing 36% and 22% of discordant segmentation and peak identification over the reference values ( table 2 ) .\nour concordance rates are representative of the techniques , and the actual rates are expected to vary with quality of samples and acgh platforms used .\ncombined , our results show that of the methods tested scomp is the most suitable method for wga of ffpe tissues and delivers results similar to nonamplified samples .\nunderstanding the genomic characteristics and evolution of breast cancer lesions is a necessary step to answer many of the questions posed in the clinical setting , including which lesions are more likely to develop local recurrence or metastasis and therefore who would benefit from adjuvant therapy .\nunfortunately , the lesions of interest are usually small and the availability of genomic dna for research extremely limited .\nuse of existing breast archival ffpe material is optimized by microdissecting samples to obtain homogeneous histologically defined cell populations from small - volume lesions .\nwga can not be avoided in these settings , and our data show that scomp has the potential to be an invaluable tool for breast cancer research . \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

", "response": " This article investigates the efficacy and accuracy of whole-genome amplification (WGA) methods for analyzing the genomic characteristics of breast cancer tissue samples, particularly formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. The researchers compare four WGA techniques: two variations of degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR), single-cell comparative genomic hybridization (SComp), and a T7-based linear amplification method.  \n\nInitially, they evaluated the DOP-PCR methods but encountered challenges with their reliability and contamination issues. They ultimately focused on comparing SComp and DOP-PCR, using both high-quality DNA from cell lines and DNA extracted from FFPE tissue.  They assessed the amplified DNA by array comparative genomic hybridization (ACGH) and validated results with quantitative PCR (qPCR).\n\nThe key finding is that SComp performed significantly better than DOP-PCR for amplifying DNA from FFPE samples. SComp-amplified DNA yielded ACGH profiles with higher concordance rates to non-amplified control samples, indicating greater accuracy in identifying genomic alterations.  While both techniques showed similar overall correlation with controls, SComp demonstrated a lower percentage of discordant spots and a higher percentage of concordantly identified segments and peaks, suggesting fewer amplification-related errors.\n\nTherefore, the authors conclude that SComp is a more suitable WGA method for studying FFPE breast cancer tissue samples, particularly when analyzing small, microdissected lesions where limited DNA material is available. This finding is particularly relevant for breast cancer research as it allows for more accurate genomic profiling of small, early-stage lesions, which could contribute to a deeper understanding of cancer development and progression, ultimately leading to improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "summarization_037", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nAnd the funny thing is, I'm only half joking. This might be a bit of a read, but I promise it's worth it. \n Last Day in Harrenhal \n > Roose Bolton was seated by the hearth reading from a thick leatherbound book when she entered.  “Light some candles,”  he commanded her as he turned a page.  “It grows gloomy in here.” \n > She placed the food at his elbow and did as he bid her, filling the room with flickering light and the scent of cloves. Bolton turned a few more pages with his finger, then closed the book and placed it carefully in the fire.  He watched the flames consume it, pale eyes shining with reflected light.  The old dry leather went up with a whoosh, and the yellow pages stirred as they burned,  as if some ghost were reading them. \n This is, without a doubt, the spookiest passage in the whole of  A Clash of Kings , maybe even the whole series. As much as we like to joke about Roose Bolton being a vampire, he's closer to a Bond villain. Let's try to figure out what's really going on here. \n I get from this passage that: \n \n Roose has been reading for some time (he notices it gets dark, as if he had been absorbed by the book).  \n The comment It grows gloomy here might reflect what he is reading. \n Roose does not read the book completely. \n He burns the book calmly and deliberately.  \n \n I am intrigued by the mention of Roose's eyes. Roose is famously a cipher, but when he does show emotion he shows it in his eyes. \n > There was an agelessness about him, a stillness; on Roose Bolton’s face, rage and joy looked much the same. All he and Ramsay had in common were their eyes. \n Eye color is traditionally important in GRRM's writing but Roose Bolton's eyes in particular are striking, even disturbing for many onlookers. \n > Bolton’s silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat’s slobbering malevolence. Pale as morning mist, his eyes concealed more than they told. Jaime misliked those eyes. \n But they conceal as often as they reveal. \n > Bolton’s pale eyes looked empty in the moonlight, as if there were  no one  behind them at all. \n I am also intrigued by the specific note that  the firelight is shining in them.  The word 'shining' is deployed very specifically in our story, and there are a couple of similar incidents I'd like to point out, with Bolton: \n > ^(She broke off as Roose Bolton rose to his feet,  pale eyes shining in the torchlight.  \"My friends,\" he began, and a hush swept through the hall, so profound that Theon could hear the wind plucking at the boards over the windows.) \n and with Melisandre: \n > ^(Jon let out a white breath. \"He is not always so …\") \n > ^(\"… warm? Warmth calls to warmth, Jon Snow.\"  Her eyes were two red stars, shining in the dark. At her throat, her ruby gleamed, a third eye glowing brighter than the others.  Jon had seen Ghost's eyes blazing red the same way, when they caught the light just right.) \n And  especially  Moqorro: \n > ^( They are all the same, these magic men. The mouse warned me of pain as well.  \"I am ironborn, priest. I laugh at pain. You will have what you require … but if you fail, and my hand is not healed, I will cut your throat myself and give you to the sea.\") \n > ^( Moqorro bowed, his dark eyes shining.  \"So be it.\") \n Later on, at the end of Victarion's TWOW chapter: \n > ^(Victarion seized the dusky woman by the wrist and pulled her to him. “She will do it. Go pray to your red god.  Light your fire, and tell me what you see.” ) \n > ^( Moqorro’s dark eyes seemed to shine.  “I see dragons.”**) \n Note that Moqorro doesn't even have to look. He sees dragons every time he looks in the fire. \n > ^(\"Someone told me that the night is dark and full of terrors. What do you see in those flames?\") \n > ^( \"Dragons,\"  Moqorro said in the Common Tongue of Westeros. He spoke it very well, with hardly a trace of accent. No doubt that was one reason the high priest Benerro had chosen him to bring the faith of R'hllor to Daenerys Targaryen. \" Dragons old and young, true and false, bright and dark.  And you. A small man with a big shadow, snarling in the midst of all.\") \n Oh, and Bloodraven: \n > ^(\"Are you the three-eyed crow?\" Bran heard himself say.  A three-eyed crow should have three eyes .  He has only one, and that one red.   Bran could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the torchlight. ) \n In addition to these, the direwolves and their packs are constantly mentioned as having shining eyes, as well as the wights: \n > ^(Jon Snow remembered the wight rising,  its eyes shining blue in the pale dead face.  He knew why, he was certain.) \n These incidents are linked, and we will return to them. But for now, let's return to Roose Bolton and his book. \n Farenheit 451 \n It needn't be said that in the pre-printing era a book is a treasure, so burning one is significant. Roose and his men are about to abscond from Harrenhal, yet instead of taking the book with him he burns it. Along with the mention of candlelight in his eyes, we have a mention of the scent of cloves. Cloves are used in pseudo-magical rituals in the real world, and we have another mention of scented candles in Arya's story that might be relevant: \n > ^(He laid a finger on her lips. \"Three lives you shall have of me. No more, no less. Three and we are done. So a girl must ponder.\" He kissed her hair softly. \"But not too long.\") \n > ^(By the time Arya lit her stub of a candle,  only a faint smell remained of him, a whiff of ginger and cloves lingering in the air. ) \n The Faceless Men are known for their use of scented candles: \n > ^(When our sins and our sufferings grow too great to be borne, the angel takes us by the hand to lead us to the nightlands, where the stars burn ever bright. Those who come to drink from the black cup are looking for their angels. If they are afraid, the candles soothe them.  When you smell our candles burning, what does it make you think of, my child?\" ) \n And curiously enough, these candles are said to cause visions: \n > ^(The second body was that of an old woman. She had gone to sleep upon a dreaming couch, in one of the hidden alcoves  where special candles conjured visions of things loved and lost. ) \n Finally, the final line of Roose's book burning evokes the presence of some sort of spirit,  a ghost reading the burned pages. \n > ^( He watched the flames consume it, pale eyes shining with reflected light.  The old dry leather went up with a whoosh, and the yellow pages stirred as they burned,  as if some ghost were reading them. ) \n So here is my theory. Roose isn't sacrificing this book. He's not burning it for the purposes of destroying it, and he's not burning it on a whim. This is a calculated action.  Roose Bolton is  communicating  with someone.  Roose sent an email. \n So let's talk about glass candles. \n Sorcery, Prophecy, and Glass Candles \n According to Maester Marwyn, here are the powers of a glass candle: \n \n See across mountains, seas, and deserts \n Enter people's dreams \n Give people visions \n Speak to one another half a world apart \n \n I've theorized before about glass candles and their relation to R'hllorism; it's my belief that glass candles are responsible for all these visions in the flames Melisandre and Moqorro and Varys and everyone else have seen. I believe [Valyrian dragonlords created the R'hllor religion by giving slaves visions in the fire using the glass candles. R'hllorism is the perfect tool to control their slaves; it preaches acceptance that life is hell but promises rebirth in death, and obedience to whatever flame visions the Valyrian slave masters decide to send.]( \n What's more, it's built on intolerance of other faiths: \n >  \"The man who honors all the gods honors none at all,\"  a prophet of the Lord of Light, R'hllor the Red, once famously declared. \n And TWOIAF specifically points out that this sort of intolerance was overwhelmingly to the advantage of the Freehold: \n > ^(Some scholars have suggested that the dragonlords regarded all faiths as equally false, believing themselves to be more powerful than any god or goddess.  They looked upon priests and temples as relics of a more primitive time, though useful for placating \"slaves, savages, and the poor\" with promises of a better life to come.  Moreover, a multiplicity of gods helped to keep their subjects divided and lessened the chances of their uniting under the banner of a single faith to overthrow their overlords. Religious tolerance was to them a means of keeping the peace in the Lands of the Long Summer.) \n You can click the above link for more details, but the bottom line is that R'hllorism keeps slaves placated, accepting of death, and unlikely to revolt. It also creates Red Priests, patsys who can be shown visions and made to do whatever the sender desires. That is Melisandre; we know her visions are real. She sees things she couldn't possibly know of, including an evil Bloodraven and Bran: \n > ^(A wooden face, corpse white.  Was this the enemy?  A thousand red eyes floated in the rising flames.  He sees me.  Beside him, a boy with a wolf’s face threw back his head and howled.) \n Hardhome: \n > ^(Snowflakes swirled from a dark sky and ashes rose to meet them, the grey and the white whirling around each other as flaming arrows arced above a wooden wall and dead things shambled silent through the cold, beneath a great grey cliff where fires burned inside a hundred caves. Then the wind rose and the white mist came sweeping in, impossibly cold, and one by one the fires went out. Afterward only the skulls remained.) \n And  Jon Snow. \n > ^(The flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name  Jon Snow.   His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again,  a shadow half-seen behind a fluttering curtain.) \n Melisandre appears to believe that there's some skill involved in reading the flames, but as many non-priests like Varys and Stannis see visions as well: \n > ^(\"Yet I still dream of that night, my lord. Not of the sorcerer, nor his blade, nor even the way my manhood shriveled as it burned. I dream of the voice.  The voice from the flames.  Was it a god, a demon, some conjurer's trick? I could not tell you, and I know all the tricks.  All I can say for a certainty is that he called it, and it answered. ) \n \n > ^(Stannis stared at the silver dish.  \"She has shown it to me, Lord Davos. In the flames.” ) \n > ^(“You saw it, sire?” It was not like Stannis Baratheon to lie about such a thing.) \n > ^( “With mine own eyes.\" ) \n This last point is driven home again and again, in both the books [and the show.]( Looking into that fire is the thing that tips Stannis from nonbeliever to believer, and Davos has no answer for him. Convienently, it's also what saves Melisandre from certain death. \n And what do you know, [ her eyes are shining with reflected light. ]( \n [ As are his. ]( \n Red R'hllor's WiFire Network \n So okay, even if we accept that visions in the flames are given through glass candles, that almost creates more questions than it answers. The Valyrians are gone, and it seems we have multiple entities today acting with glass candles. Who might Roose Bolton be communicating with? How? How does this all work? \n I believe the powers of the glass candles function in a very specific way that we will be able to look back upon and analyze in retrospect. Recall how GRRM introduced Bloodraven's magical abilities into the story; the messenger ravens from the first four books were secretly a part of his supernatural surveillance network.  Bloodraven is not omnipotent.  He cannot see everything, and it's very important to GRRM that we know what he could and could not see so the story retains its tension. Thus, the limitation of the ravens. \n I believe glass candles have a similar ability. They seem to operate on an  all fires are one fire  basis.  Anyone with a glass candle can look into it, focus, and look out of any other lit fire.  This includes the sun, which is why the Valyrian sorcerers could look on any place where the sun shines (mountains, seas, deserts) but not into the deep forest, the domain of the Children. It also includes hearthfires. And if we accept the idea that fires are spy cameras, the traditions of R'hllorism begin to make a lot more sense: \n > It was never truly dark in Melisandre’s chambers. \n > Three tallow candles burned upon her windowsill to keep the terrors of the night at bay. Four more flickered beside her bed, two to either side.  In the hearth a fire was kept burning day and night. The first lesson those who would serve her had to learn was that the fire must never, ever be allowed to go out. \n And now, the important part. \n Red R'hllor's Fax Machine \n Glass candles can read burned pieces of paper. \n Here are the known wielders of glass candles: \n \n Marwyn \n Quaithe \n Melisandre's benefactor \n Moqorro's benefactor \n \n For what it's worth, I believe Melisandre and Moqorro are being shown visions by the same person. I am not referring to the god, but for now, let's just call them \"R'hllor\" (I have a theory on his identity, but it's not important for this discussion right now). Due to \"R'hllor's\" visions of Stannis,  Melisandre has gone rogue. \n > Melisandre has gone to Stannis on her own and has her own agenda. - SSM \n And if whoever it is can read burned pieces of paper, several moves Team Dragonstone graduate from smart to downright brilliant. Especially this one. \n > ^(Stannis turned to Davos. “The maester tells me that we have one hundred seventeen ravens on hand. I mean to use them all. One hundred seventeen ravens will carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.  Perhaps a hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow. If so, a hundred maesters will read my words to as many lords in as many solars and bedchambers... and then the letters will like as not be consigned to the fire, and lips pledged to silence.  These great lords love Joffrey, or Renly, or Robb Stark. I am their rightful king, but they will deny me if they can. So I have need of you.”) \n Stanins is 100% correct about this.  Any lord loyal to the Lannisters would burn the letter immediately, as Cersei and Tywin order: \n > ^( \"I want these letters burned, every one,\"  Cersei declared. \"No hint of this must reach my son's ears, or my father's.\") \n > ^(\"I imagine Father's heard rather more than a hint by now,\" Tyrion said dryly. \"Doubtless Stannis sent a bird to Casterly Rock, and another to Harrenhal. As for burning the letters, to what point?) \n \n > ^(Once she even overheard Maester Tothmure’s serving girl confiding to her brother about some message that said Joffrey was a bastard and not the rightful king at all.  “Lord Tywin told him to burn the letter and never speak such filth again,”  the girl whispered.) \n The advantage to Team Dragonstone is obvious; the letters allow R'hllor to instantly take stock of Stannis' opposition.  Anyone who burns the letter is a Lannister loyalist. Anyone who keeps it around for a while may be won to Stannis's cause. \n Later on, Davos reads the letter from the Night's Watch and entreats Stannis to go to the Wall. And what does Melisandre do to communicate his suggestion to the Lord of Light? You guessed it, [ she burns the letter and stares into the flames. ]( \n There are many other letters and papers burned in our story, and with multiple candle operators it's hard to tell who's learning what at what time. Regardless, many of these letters (show and books) contain vital information. So we will make a list, and return to Bolton and his book at the end. \n \n Theon's letter to Robb warning him of Balon's plan to attack the North \n \n Robb's letter, contents unknown. \n > ^(Queen Jeyne wet her lips. \"Robb has not eaten all day. I had Rollam bring him a nice supper, boar's ribs and stewed onions and ale, but he never touched a bite of it.  He spent all morning writing a letter and told me not to disturb him, but when the letter was done he burned it. ) \n \n Lysa's letter to Catelyn, (falsely) accusing the Lannisters of murdering Jon Arryn and requesting that she burn it. \n > ^(Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell, but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer … perhaps because the dwarf was here, while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep, hundreds of leagues to the south. Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister's letter before reading it.) \n \n Littlefinger's letter to Catelyn, contents unknown. \n > ^(\"He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother's place.\") \n \n The Martells' letter to Aegon that instantly got him to withdraw from Dorne, contents unknown: \n > ^(King Aegon was determined to refuse the offer until Princess Deria placed in his hands a private letter from her father, Prince Nymor. Aegon read it upon the Iron Throne, and men say that when he rose, his hand was bleeding, so hard had he clenched it. He burned the letter and departed immediately on Balerion's back for Dragonstone. When he returned the next morning, he agreed to the peace and signed a treaty to that effect.) \n \n Cersei's letter to Jaime at Riverrun. \n > ^(\"Come at once,\" she had written, in the letter he'd had Peck burn at Riverrun. \"Help me. Save me. I need you now as I have never needed you before. I love you. I love you. I love you. Come at once.\") \n \n Ser Dontos' letter to Sansa, telling her he'd help her escape. \n > ^(Once alone, she thrust the note in the flames, watching the parchment curl and blacken.  Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home. ) \n \n \n And now, finally, back to Bolton. \n therooseisloose@harrenhal.fire \n Of all these letters, of all the people in the story,  only Roose Bolton, Marwyn, and Qyburn seem to know of this magic and how it works.  In the same chapter as he burns the book, he and Qyburn have Arya burn another important letter from Fat Walda in the very same fire. \n > He shrugged. “Nan, my fur cloak.” She brought it to him. “My chambers will be clean and orderly upon my return,” he told her as she fastened it.  “And tend to Lady Walda’s letter.” \n > “As you say, my lord.” \n > The lord and maester swept from the room, giving her not so much as a backward glance.  When they were gone, Arya took the letter and carried it to the hearth, stirring the logs with a poker to wake the flames anew. She watched the parchment twist, blacken, and flare up. \n So to whom did Roose upload his attachment? I don't think it's \"R'hllor\"  - unlike Varys apparently, Roose Bolton isn't a man to be undone by mummer's tricks. He doesn't have to worry about firetaps either, because like with the weirwood network, the candle wielder has to be focusing on that specific fire.  I believe that Roose Bolton is communicating with Marwyn. While these two individuals may seem to have nothing in common, they are actually directly connected by a mutual association with Qyburn. \n The necromancer is clearly part of Roose's inner circle, since he is invited to the important political conversation with the Freys. He is also charge of the leeching and of tending the ravens, positions of great trust. It's never explained how Qyburn could have gained Roose's trust so quickly. \n Here is my theory: \n \n Qyburn had visited Harrenhal's library as soon as he got in with the Bloody Mummers. \n \n He made some findings of great interest (the book) that he passed to the new lord, Roose. \n \n He then passed a message to him on Marwyn's behalf, and Roose rewarded him with a position of privileged knowledge. Their collaboration began. \n \n \n So what purposes is the Marwyn-Roose-Qyburn triangle working toward? That's a conversation for next time. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nLetter\nThe F-35 Lightning II aircraft (F-35) provides advanced tactical aviation  capabilities for the Department of Defense (DOD) and is intended to  replace a variety of legacy fighter aircraft in the Air Force, Navy, and  Marine Corps. The F-35 is also DOD’s most ambitious and costly weapon  system in history, with acquisition and sustainment costs for the three  U.S. military services estimated at over $1.6 trillion over a 66-year life  cycle. The Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) is integral to  the more than 3,300 F-35 aircraft that the U.S. military services and  foreign nations plan to purchase. ALIS is a complex system that supports  operations, mission planning, supply-chain management, maintenance,  and other processes. ALIS—described as the critical information  technology element connecting the entire F-35 enterprise—is, according  to one DOD official, one of three major components that make up the F- 35, along with the airframe and engine. It comprises both software and  hardware. The F-35 program has been developing ALIS capabilities  incrementally. A fully functional ALIS is critical to the operational success  of the F-35.\nALIS is intended to enable holistic fleet management, improve speed,  enhance readiness, and reduce costs to the F-35 program. However, we  have reported over the past 5 years on key risks associated with ALIS.\nIn 2014, we found that ALIS was experiencing recurring problems, including user issues, which were contributing to time-consuming workarounds for maintainers and a backlogged issue-resolution process. Additionally, we found that the F-35 program did not have a process, with metrics and targets, to determine and address the most  significant performance issues with ALIS. As a result, we  recommended that DOD establish a performance measurement  process for ALIS.\nIn 2016, we reported on several key risks with ALIS, such as  challenges deploying, data accuracy and accessibility issues, and the  lack of a redundant infrastructure in the event of a system failure. We  recommended that DOD develop a plan to prioritize and address ALIS  issues. We also found that training for ALIS was largely ineffective  and lacked a standardized, common curriculum for teaching users  how to operate ALIS. We recommended that DOD develop a  standardized, program-wide plan for ALIS training.\nIn 2018, based on classified findings, we recommended that the F-35  program test the operation of the F-35 disconnected from ALIS for  extended periods of time in a variety of scenarios to assess the risks  related to operating and sustaining the aircraft.\nDOD concurred with these recommendations and has taken some actions  in response, such as developing a training plan for ALIS users.\nYou asked us to review DOD’s efforts to address concerns from users of  ALIS, improve ALIS functionality, and determine the long-term viability of  the system. This report assesses the extent to which (1) improvements  have been made over the past 5 years and challenges remain for users of  the F-35’s ALIS, and (2) DOD is taking actions to enhance the long-term  viability of the system.\nFor each of our objectives, we reviewed relevant F-35 sustainment and  ALIS-related data, plans, program briefings, guidance, and other  documentation. We interviewed officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; the F-35 Joint  Program Office; the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation; the U.S.  Air Force; the U.S. Navy; the U.S. Marine Corps; and the prime  contractor, Lockheed Martin. We conducted site visits to 5 of the 10 U.S.  F-35 locations—Luke Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, Nellis Air  Force Base, Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, and Naval Air Station  Lemoore. We selected these locations to obtain perspectives from ALIS- users from all U.S. services participating in the F-35 program, and to  include operational, training, and testing locations. Additionally, we  developed and used a data collection instrument to collect ALIS-related  information from users (i.e. maintainers, pilots, supply personnel,  contractors) at all 10 U.S. F-35 locations. Finally, we met with officials  from the F-35 Joint Program Office, MIT Lincoln Labs, Lockheed Martin  Rotary and Mission Systems, Air Force Digital Service, Kessel Run (Air  Force), and others to discuss ALIS-related efforts.\nIn support of these objectives, we gathered data from the prime  contractor for fiscal year 2019 (October 2018–September 2019), the most  recent complete fiscal year information available for F-35 fleet  performance during our audit timeframes. To determine the reliability of  these data, we collected information from the prime contractor on how the  data were collected, managed, and used. Although we identified some  limitations in the way that the data were being collected and reported that  could potentially result in inaccuracies, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for providing information on the progress and  challenges within the program. For a detailed description of our scope  and methodology, see appendix I.\nWe conducted this performance audit from August 2018 to March 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix I: Scope and Methodology\nFor each of our objectives, we reviewed relevant F-35 sustainment and  the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)-related data, plans,  program briefs, guidance, and other documentation and collected  information by interviewing officials from the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the F-35 Joint Program  Office, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, the Defense  Contract Management Agency, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the  U.S. Marine Corps, the Air Force Digital Service, and the prime  contractor, Lockheed Martin. To interview officials and observe ALIS- related operations, we conducted site visits to five F-35 locations—Luke  Air Force Base, Arizona; Edwards Air Force Base, California; Nellis Air  Force Base, Nevada; Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona; and Naval  Air Station Lemoore, California. We selected these locations to obtain  perspectives from ALIS-users (i.e. maintainers, pilots, supply personnel,  contractors) from all U.S. services participating in the F-35 program,  including from operational, training, and testing locations. Additionally, we  developed a data collection instrument to collect ALIS-related inputs and  data from ALIS-users (i.e. maintainers, pilots, supply personnel,  contractors) at all 10 U.S. F-35 locations—Luke Air Force Base, Arizona;  Edwards Air Force Base, California; Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada;  Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona; Naval Air Station Lemoore,  California; Hill Air Force Base, Utah; Naval Air Station Patuxent,  Maryland; Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; Marine Corps Air Station  Beaufort, South Carolina; and Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.  Finally, we met with officials from the F-35 Joint Program Office,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Labs, Lockheed  Martin Rotary and Mission Systems, Air Force Digital Service, Kessel Run  (Air Force), and others to discuss ALIS-related improvement efforts.\nIn support of our objectives, we gathered data from fiscal year 2019 (the  most recent full fiscal year of data available at the time of our review) from  the prime contractor on the performance of the F-35 fleet such as the full  and mission capability rates. We also collected the most recent available  information on ALIS software deficiencies. To determine the reliability of  these data, we collected information on how the data were collected,  managed, and used through a questionnaire and interviews. Although we  identified some limitations in the way that certain data are being collected  and reported—such as data related to aircraft performance like mission  capability rates—we determined that they are sufficiently reliable for the  way in which we reported them and our purposes of providing information  on the progress and challenges within the program. All the performance  data presented in our report are sufficiently reliable to provide a general  comparison of capabilities to minimum targets.\nTo assess the extent to which there have been improvements as well as  key challenges with ALIS over the last 5 years, we interviewed officials  and examined guidance and briefing documents from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the U.S.  Services, the F-35 Joint Program Office, the Defense Contract  Management Agency and Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems  officials to discuss the current status of the system and plans for  mitigating risks.\nTo determine user views on risks to (or issues with) ALIS, we interviewed  officials at our 5 selected bases, conducted a short data collection  instrument of the other 5 bases, interviewed officials at Air Force  headquarters and the contractor, and reviewed relevant documents. At  the 5 bases, we interviewed groups of pilots, maintainers and supply  personnel about ALIS performance, challenges, and possible  improvements. In addition, we posed several targeted questions based on  risks found in our last report. In total, we received input from more than  160 users at the 5 bases we visited through group discussions or  interviews.\nWe analyzed the responses provided in these group interviews, and  identified the issues/risks that at least one set of users reported at each of  the 5 bases. We also considered any improvements that were described  as having occurred during the last few years. We also compared the  responses from the interviews at the 5 bases with our data collection  responses, and the other testimonial and documentary evidence we  obtained. The list of issues/risks we identified contains some that were  reported in our 2016 report as well as some new ones. While this list  summarizes the types of issues/risks described at the 5 bases, and also  in other interviews and document review, individual user views and  experiences could vary by base and user group.\nWe also interviewed officials and reviewed reports from the Air Force  Audit Agency, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, and the  Department of Defense Inspector General to identify improvements as  well as any functionality issues with ALIS. We interviewed and gathered  information from DOD officials on testing for ALIS, metrics on ALIS’s  performance, and the operations of the system.\nAs discussed previously, we collected and analyzed data for fiscal year  2019 that we obtained from the prime contractor on the overall aircraft  performance such as the full mission capability and mission capability  rates. We analyzed and compared information obtained from interviews,  site visits, data collection instruments, and documents with guidance such  as DOD’s System Engineering Guide for System of Systems to determine  the extent to which DOD has an effective procedure for addressing and  mitigating specific risks and challenges that may be associated with a  major weapon system. We also compared this information with previous  GAO reports from 2014, 2016, and 2018 to determine the extent to which  DOD has addressed our prior recommendations on ALIS-related issues.\nTo assess the extent to which the F-35 program has addressed issues  with ALIS, we gathered and analyzed data from the prime contractor on  open and closed ALIS deficiencies identified from November 2017  through October 2018. We selected this timeframe because it included  the most recent data on ALIS deficiencies at the time of our review and  also allowed us to observe trends in ALIS deficiencies over a two-year  period. The data we received included summary information on the total  number of open deficiencies, the total number of closed deficiencies, the  number of newly closed deficiencies, the number of newly identified  deficiencies, and the total number of open category 1 through category 3  deficiencies (considered critical or adverse) for each month during the  two-year period. To determine the reliability of these data, we conducted  electronic tests to identify any internal inconsistencies with the data. We  also reviewed documentation from the prime contractor on the  management of ALIS deficiency data and collected information on how  the data were collected, managed, and used through a questionnaire.  Specifically, we asked questions about inconsistencies we identified  through electronic testing of the data, the extent to which the prime  contractor’s system for collecting deficiency information includes edit  checks or controls to help ensure the data are entered accurately, and  limitations related to the accuracy or completeness of the data. As a  result, we determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  reporting trends in the number of open and closed ALIS deficiencies over  time.\nTo determine the extent to which DOD is taking actions to enhance the  long-term viability of the system, we interviewed officials and reviewed  guidance and/or planning documents from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the F-35 Joint  Program Office, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. We interviewed officials from  the prime contractor to determine their role in helping DOD mitigate risks  regarding the long-term viability for ALIS. Additionally, we examined  briefing documents from the MIT-Lincoln Labs, a federally-funded  research and development center assisting the F-35 Joint Program  Office, on plans, timelines, and risks for modernizing the hardware and  software.\nWe interviewed officials from the Air Force’s Kessel Run team to discuss  their Mad Hatter initiative (intended to improve ALIS functionality), the  viability of current ALIS software, and any risks associated with the future  of ALIS. We conducted a site visit to Nellis Air Force Base to observe the  Mad Hatter initiative and discuss its results and the future of ALIS  software. Further, as discussed previously, we analyzed data from  November 2017 through October 2019 on ALIS deficiencies. We  reviewed reports and interviewed officials from the Air Force Digital  Service and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation on the future  viability of these long-term initiatives for ALIS. Finally, we analyzed and  compared information obtained from interviews, site visits, and  documents with applicable guidance to determine the extent to which  DOD has an effective long-term plan for ALIS that addresses operational  and financial risks.\nIn support of our work, we interviewed officials from the following DOD  organizations and other organizations during our review. We selected  these organizations based on their oversight, planning, and/or execution  roles related to F-35 ALIS operations.\nOffice of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and  Sustainment, Arlington, Virginia\nOffice of the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation, Arlington,\nDefense Contract Management Agency Lockheed Martin, Orlando,\nF-35 Joint Program Office, Arlington, Virginia\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition,\nAir Force F-35 Integration Office, Arlington, Virginia\nKessel Run Team, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts\nLuke Air Force Base, Arizona\n56th Maintenance Group\n61st Aircraft Maintenance Unit\n62nd Aircraft Maintenance Unit\nEdwards Air Force Base, California\nNellis Air Force Base, Nevada\n57th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron\nNavy F-35 Integration Office, Arlington, Virginia\nNaval Air Station Lemoore, California\nStrike Fighter Wing Pacific\nStrike Fighter Squadron 125\nStrike Fighter Squadron 147\nMarine Corps F-35 Integration Office\nMarine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona\nMarine Aircraft Group 13\nMarine Aviation Logistics Squadron 13\nMarine Fighter Attack Squadron 211\nMarine Fighter Attack Squadron 122\nAir Force Digital Service, Arlington, Virginia\nLockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems, Orlando, Florida\nMIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, Massachusetts  We conducted this performance audit from August 2018 to March 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides and reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense\nAppendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nRelated GAO Products\nF-35 Aircraft Sustainment: DOD Faces Challenges in Sustaining a  Growing Fleet.

analysis of 19 studies on patients with ngu showed that mycoplasma genitalium was found in 21% compared with 7% of patients without ngu .\nross et al reported a detection rate of 0.6% for mycoplasma genitalium in asymptomatic british persons .\ncurrently , nucleic acid amplification tests ( naats ) are usually recommended to detect this pathogen .\nwikstrm and jensen reported that mycoplasma genitalium is a common cause of persistent or recurrent urethritis among men treated with doxycycline , and erythromycin appears to be less efficient than azithromycin in eradicating the infection .\ntherefore , when physicians encounter patients who complain of continuous symptoms of urethritis , they should consider drug - refractory urethritis such as that caused by mycoplasma genitalium .\nit is another pathogen of sti of the urogenital tract , and men with this infection rarely exhibit symptoms . in women , greenish - yellow frothy vaginal discharge and itching\ntrichomoniasis is treated and cured with metronidazole or tinidazole , which should be prescribed to any sexual partners as well because they may be asymptomatic carriers .\nsutton et al reported that the prevalence of trichomonas vaginalis in reproductive - aged women was 3.1% . in our study , the total prevalence rate was 1.1% in asymptomatic people , and prevalence rates in asymptomatic men and women were 0.2% and 2.5% , respectively . screening for these pathogens is important not only to identify infected symptomatic individuals for the diagnosis and management of their infections but also to identify asymptomatic individuals who serve as reservoirs for infection [ 1 - 4 ] . in our study , there were 50 ( 7.1% ) infected people among 709 asymptomatic people ; thus , this proportion should not be neglected . among the 50 infected patients , 37 with chlamydia trachomatis , 1 with neisseria gonorrhoeae , 1 with mycoplasma genitalium , 8 with trichomonas vaginalis , 2 with chlamydia trachomatis with neisseria gonorrhoeae , and 1 with chlamydia trachomatis with mycoplasma genitalium were confirmed .\nthus , regardless of chlamydia trachomatis , 13 patients should be considered as candidates for antimicrobial treatment .\nthese facts suggest the possibility of prescribing the wrong medicines if practitioners give symptomatic patients some regimens empirically . therefore , the need to detect multiple species at once should be raised . in this sense , use of the multiplex pcr assay to screen asymptomatic people may be important because the treatment regimen could be optimized for people with positive results , especially for those with multiple organisms .\nhowever , ureaplasma urealyticum is frequently isolated from the urethra of healthy men , and some studies have reported that there is no significant difference in its prevalence between men with ngu and men without ngu .\nnevertheless , there are some reports that ureaplasma urealyticum serves as a cause of persistent ngu . for that reason , ureaplasma urealyticum\ntherefore , ureaplasma infection must be considered in patients with treatment failure for ngu or patients with multiple sexual partners .\nif no species except ureaplasma are detected , symptoms and leukocyte numbers in first voided urine samples are helpful for clarifying the diagnosis of ureaplasma infection .\nmycoplasma hominis is frequently identified from the genitourinary tract . in general , it is known as a commensal species but it can work as a pathogen in special conditions such as in an immunocompromised state . generally , the rate of colonization of mycoplasma hominis in the urogenital tract was reported to be between 4% and 13% in men and between 21% an 54% in women .\nour study showed that the incidence of this species was 9.1% in men and 15.4% in women . in our study , the incidences of ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis were 22.1% and 11.6% .\nnevertheless , those incidences were increased up to 35.0% and 22.5% when the samples had chlamydia trachomatis .\nthe reason for this increase with chlamydial infection is not clear , and a limitation of our study is that we did not include people who had symptoms .\ntherefore , comparison of the prevalence of these species in symptomatic urethritis patients is necessary . as described previously , most pathogens causing sti as well as commensal microorganisms are difficult to cultivate by routine microbiological diagnosis .\nhowever , naats , such as pcr , are useful for the identification of microorganisms that are difficult to cultivate and for those that grow slowly . in another recent study in korea , the multiplex pcr kit ( seegene inc . , seoul , korea )\nwas used to detect causative microorganisms of sti in patients with chronic prostatitis and vaginitis . in multiplex pcr , more than one target sequence can be amplified by including more than one pair of primers in the reaction .\nmultiplex pcr has the potential to produce considerable savings of time and effort within the laboratory without compromising test utility .\nfurthermore , when the clinical sample amount is limited , multiplexing allows more targets to be analyzed by using a single aliquot of sample material .\nalthough there are some worries that multiplex pcr in the clinical setting may have difficulties such as poor sensitivity or specificity , false - negative results , and nonspecific interactions , horii et al showed that the multiplex pcr assay had an overall sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100% compared with uniplex pcr assays . furthermore , there was no cross - reaction with other microorganisms .\nthe multiplex pcr assay has recently made it convenient for clinicians to test for causative organisms simultaneously from many clinical fields .\nsimilarly , we succeeded in easily generating results by use of multiplex pcr with only a single sample per person .\nasymptomatic individuals play a role as reservoirs for sti . in our study , there were 50 ( 7.1% ) infected people among 709 asymptomatic people ; therefore , this proportion should not be neglected .\nan sti screening test should be considered as a part of a general checkup , especially in high -

The prevalence rates for the individual pathogens were: *C. trachomatis* (5.6%), *N. gonorrhoeae* (0.4%), *M. genitalium* (0.3%), *U. urealyticum* (22.1%), *M. hominis* (11.6%), and *T. vaginalis* (1.1%). Notably, excluding *U. urealyticum* and *M. hominis*, which are often considered commensal organisms, the prevalence of other STIs amongst asymptomatic individuals was 7.1%.\n\nThe findings emphasize the significant proportion of asymptomatic STI carriers within the population, highlighting their potential role in silently transmitting infections. The researchers advocate for incorporating STI screening, particularly using multiplex PCR for its efficiency in detecting multiple pathogens simultaneously, into routine general checkups, especially for high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers, individuals with multiple sexual partners, and immunocompromised individuals. This approach can aid in early detection, treatment, and ultimately, contribute to STI prevention within the community.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "summarization_042", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nLetter\nCongress created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to  protect homeowners from flood losses, minimize the exposure of  properties to flood damage, and alleviate taxpayers’ exposure to flood  losses. However, as we have previously reported, the program faces a  number of challenges. The magnitude of major flood events since 2005,  combined with attempts to keep policyholder rates affordable, have  resulted in insufficient premium revenue, which threatens the program’s  ability to pay claims over the long term. Compounding these challenges is  a small subset of NFIP-insured properties known as repetitive loss (RL)  properties, which have flooded and received a claim payment multiple  times. These factors have resulted in NFIP accruing billions of dollars in  debt, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has  repeatedly borrowed from the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to  pay claims. While Congress cancelled $16 billion of NFIP’s debt in 2017,  as of March 2020, NFIP still owed Treasury $20.5 billion. NFIP has been  on our high-risk list since 2006 because of its financial and management  challenges.\nIn addition to NFIP, FEMA administers several hazard mitigation  assistance (HMA) grant programs that provide funding to states and  localities to mitigate the flood risk of NFIP-insured properties and  structures, using a variety of methods. One such method is property  acquisition, where FEMA provides funding for the purchase of a property  from a willing property owner, demolishes the structure, and converts the  property to green space. These properties no longer pose a flood risk,  and the green space can alleviate flooding of other properties. As a result,  property acquisition can help reduce NFIP’s fiscal exposure while also  reducing flood risk for homeowners. However, questions exist about the  cost, efficiency, and effectiveness of this approach.\nYou asked us to evaluate the efficacy of FEMA’s property acquisition  efforts as a means of addressing NFIP’s financial challenges. This report  examines (1) funding programs available for property acquisitions, (2)  FEMA’s flood mitigation efforts, and (3) factors contributing to NFIP’s  fiscal exposure. In a subsequent report, we plan to assess FEMA’s  acquisition process and the extent to which property acquisition is an  effective tool for managing NFIP’s fiscal exposure.\nTo describe funding programs available for property acquisitions, we  identified HMA programs that fund property acquisition by reviewing  FEMA documentation, legislation, and regulations. We also analyzed how  the programs operate and the mitigation activities they entail. In addition,  we analyzed each program’s annual funding levels from their inception.\nTo review FEMA’s flood mitigation efforts, we analyzed FEMA HMA data  to determine how many properties FEMA helped states and communities  to mitigate, and the financial resources FEMA provided for flood  mitigation. We analyzed these data by type of mitigation (acquisition,  elevation, floodproof, or relocation), grant program, and state. We also  reviewed FEMA RL property data to assess the number of such  properties, their locations, and the extent to which they have been  mitigated.\nTo examine factors contributing to NFIP’s fiscal exposure, we analyzed  FEMA’s claims data set and its list of significant flood events. Further, we  reviewed several of our previous reports and Treasury’s statements of  public debt to identify factors that contribute to NFIP’s fiscal exposure and  how the debt has changed over time. Finally, we reviewed available  FEMA, stakeholder, and academic studies on how flood risk has changed  over time and estimates of future trends.\nWe assessed the reliability of FEMA’s HMA, policy, claims, and RL  property data by testing the data for potential reliability concerns, such as  outliers or missing values. We also interviewed FEMA officials with  knowledge of the data sets and methods used to produce these data. We  determined that all data elements we assessed were sufficiently  appropriate and reliable for each of this report’s objectives.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to June 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nFEMA Grant Programs Are Key Funding Sources for Property Acquisition\nFEMA Has Funded the Mitigation of Many Properties, but the Number of Repetitive Loss Properties Continues to Rise\nWhile Property Acquisitions Help Reduce Flood Risk for Properties, Insufficient Premium Revenue Perpetuates Fiscal Exposure\nNFIP represents a fiscal exposure to the federal government because its  premium rates have not kept pace with the flood risk of the properties it  insures. Addressing this imbalance would mean reducing the flood risk of  the insured properties, increasing premium revenue, or some combination  of both. Despite FEMA’s efforts to mitigate its insured properties’ flood  risk, premium rates for many properties do not reflect the full estimated  risk of loss. As we have reported previously, mitigation alone will not be  sufficient to resolve NFIP’s financial challenges; structural reforms to the  program’s premium rates will also be necessary.\nConcluding Observations\nBecause several categories of NFIP premium rates do not reflect the full  risk of flood loss, FEMA has had to borrow $36.5 billion from Treasury to  pay claims from several catastrophic flood events since 2005. To address  this, some have suggested additional funding to mitigate RL properties.  While we acknowledge that mitigation is part of the solution, we maintain  that a more comprehensive approach is necessary to address the  program’s fiscal exposure.\nWe have made two recommendations to FEMA that, if implemented,  could help inform Congress’ efforts to reform NFIP. In 2008, we  recommended that FEMA collect information on grandfathered properties  and analyze their financial effect on NFIP, and in 2013, we recommended  that FEMA obtain elevation information on subsidized properties. By  implementing these recommendations, FEMA would better understand  NFIP’s fiscal exposure and be able to communicate this information to  Congress.\nFurther, we suggested in 2017 that Congress take a comprehensive  approach to reforming NFIP. One important first step would be to  implement full-risk premium rates for all policies, with appropriated  means-based subsidies for some policies. Full-risk premium rates would  remove subsidies from those who do not need them, helping improve  solvency, and also more accurately signal the true flood risk to property  owners and incentivize efforts to mitigate flood risk. Further, means- based subsidies would ensure that property owners who need help will  get it, and having Congress explicitly appropriate for the subsidies would  make the true cost of the subsidy transparent to taxpayers. While this  would be an important step to putting NFIP on a sustainable path,  comprehensive reform of the program should also address the other  issues we have identified, including mitigating the flood risk of insured  properties.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Department of Homeland Security  for its review and comment. The agency provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, and other  interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the  GAO website at https://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-8678 or cackleya@gao.gov.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this  report are listed in appendix III.\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\nThis report addresses the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s  (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Our objectives were to  examine (1) funding programs available for property acquisitions, (2)  FEMA’s flood mitigation efforts, and (3) factors contributing to NFIP’s  fiscal exposure.\nTo describe funding programs available for property acquisitions, we  reviewed authorizing legislation, the Code of Federal Regulations, and  FEMA guidance and manuals, including the Hazard Mitigation Assistance  Guidance and Cost Share Guide, to identify program characteristics,  eligibility requirements, and application guidelines. To identify funding for  these programs, we analyzed FEMA’s project-level Hazard Mitigation  Assistance (HMA) data from its Enterprise Applications Development  Integration and Sustainment system, which FEMA uses to track mitigation  projects funded through its HMA grant programs. To summarize  Increased Cost of Compliance coverage, which NFIP policyholders can  use to fund mitigation efforts, we analyzed FEMA’s NFIP claims database  to identify the number and amount of such claims. We also interviewed  the FEMA officials responsible for administering these grant programs.  Further, we identified other federal agency programs that can fund  property acquisitions or meet cost share requirements and reviewed their  authorizing legislation and their relevant federal regulations. Finally, to  identify examples of state and local programs that have been used to  fund property acquisitions, we reviewed academic reports, including from  the University of North Carolina and Rice University.\nTo review FEMA’s flood mitigation efforts, we analyzed FEMA’s project- level HMA data from the “Mitigation Universe” of its Enterprise  Applications Development Integration and Sustainment system. We  analyzed several variables in this dataset, including number of properties,  federal share obligated, mitigation type category, grant program area,  grant program fiscal year, and state.\nFor the analyses by mitigation type category, we excluded projects (79  percent of the total records) that did not include a flood mitigation activity  (those with values of “Other” or “Pure Retrofit”). Of the remaining records,  98 percent were “Pure,” meaning all properties within each project were  of a single mitigation method type (acquisition, elevation, floodproof, or  relocation). The remaining 2 percent were “Mixed,” indicating a project  contained at least one acquisition and at least one elevation but could  also contain other mitigation methods. For analyses by grant program  area, we treated projects funded through the Severe Repetitive Loss and  Repetitive Flood Claims grant programs as being part of the Flood  Mitigation Assistance program and projects funded through the  Legislative Pre-Disaster Mitigation program as being part of the Pre- Disaster Mitigation program. For data on the number of flood mitigated  properties, we used the final number of properties mitigated by a project.  For data on funding, we used the federal share of the project’s obligated  funding.\nTo analyze mitigated and nonmitigated repetitive loss (RL) properties, we  summarized FEMA’s RL property mitigation report, which tracked the  cumulative number of RL properties by year from June 2009 through  June 2018. To describe the number of RL properties by state, we  analyzed FEMA’s list of RL properties as of August 31, 2019, which  included every property that at any point FEMA had designated as an RL  property under any of its three definitions. The list included properties that  had since been mitigated, as well as those that are no longer insured by  NFIP.\nTo examine factors contributing to NFIP’s fiscal exposure, we analyzed  FEMA’s claims dataset as of September 30, 2019. This dataset includes  the more than 2 million claims paid to NFIP policyholders since the  beginning of the program. We excluded records whose status was “open”  or “closed without payment.” Further, we excluded records whose year of  loss was before 1978 because FEMA officials told us that that was the  first year they considered their claims data to be reliable and complete.  To identify factors that contribute to NFIP’s fiscal exposure and illustrate  how this fiscal exposure has materialized and changed over time, we  reviewed several of our previous reports and the Department of the  Treasury’s statements of public debt. Finally, to summarize how flood risk  could change in the future, we reviewed our previous reports on climate  change.\nIn general, we adjusted for inflation any dollar figures that we compared  or aggregated across multiple years and indicated this accordingly. To do  this, we used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index for All  Urban Consumers.\nTo assess the reliability of all of the datasets we analyzed for this report,  we requested and reviewed preliminary versions of the data and  accompanying data dictionaries. We used the data dictionary to identify  potential variables for use in our analyses and output statistics on these  variables (e.g., frequencies of values, number of blanks or zero values,  minimum, maximum, and mean) to identify any potential reliability  concerns such as outliers or missing values. We met with relevant FEMA  officials to discuss each of the data sets to understand how FEMA  collected, used, and maintained the data; the reliability and completeness  of key variables; reasons for any potential discrepancies we identified;  and whether our understanding of the data and approach to analyzing  them were accurate and reasonable. After these meetings, we requested  updated versions of the data and updated our analyses accordingly. We  determined that all data elements we assessed were sufficiently  appropriate and reliable for this report’s objectives.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to June 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix II: Significant Events and GAO Reports Related to the National Flood Insurance Program’s Fiscal Exposure\nJanuary 1983: We recommended that FEMA improve its rate-setting  process to ensure adequate income for NFIP and suggested that  Congress either limit FEMA’s borrowing for extraordinary losses or  establish an emergency fund for such losses, and pay for NFIP  subsidies with appropriations.\nMarch 1994: We found that NFIP’s premium income was insufficient  to meet expected future losses because of subsidized rates and  suggested that Congress consider how any changes in premium rates  would affect policyholder participation.\nSeptember 1994: National Flood Insurance Reform Act.\nDeveloped a mitigation assistance program and expanded the  mandatory purchase requirement.\nJune 2004: Flood Insurance Reform Act.

Required  FEMA to increase rates for certain subsidized properties and  grandfathered properties; create a NFIP reserve fund; and improve  flood risk mapping.\nOctober 2012: Superstorm Sandy. Caused $8.8 billion in NFIP  claims. FEMA debt to Treasury increased to $24 billion in fiscal year  2013.\nFebruary 2013: We added limiting the federal government’s fiscal  exposure by better managing climate change risks to our high-risk  list.\nJuly 2013: We recommended that FEMA obtain elevation information  to determine full-risk rates for subsidized policyholders.\nMarch 2014: Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act.\nReinstated certain rate subsidies removed by the Biggert-Waters  Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012; established a new subsidy for  properties that are newly mapped into higher-risk zones; restored  grandfathered rates; and created a premium surcharge that would be  deposited into the NFIP reserve fund.\nOctober 2014: We recommended that FEMA amend NFIP minimum  standards for floodplain management to encourage forward-looking  construction and rebuilding efforts that reduce long-term risk and  federal exposure to losses.\nJuly 2015: We recommended that the Mitigation Framework  Leadership Group establish an investment strategy to identify,  prioritize, and guide federal investments in disaster resilience and  hazard mitigation-related activities.\nAugust-October 2016: Hurricane Matthew and Louisiana floods.\nCaused $3.1 billion in NFIP claims. FEMA debt to Treasury debt  increased to $24.6 billion in early fiscal year 2017.\nApril 2017: We suggested that Congress make comprehensive  reforms to NFIP that include actions in six areas: (1) addressing the  debt; (2) removing legislative barriers to full-risk premium rates; (3)  addressing affordability; (4) increasing consumer participation; (5)  removing barriers to private-sector involvement; and (6) protecting  NFIP flood resilience efforts.\nAugust-September 2017: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\nCaused $10 billion in NFIP claims. FEMA reached the limit of its  Treasury borrowing authority of $30.4 billion.\nSeptember 2017: NFIP’s last long-term authorization ended, resulting  in a string of short-term reauthorizations.\nOctober 2017: Congress canceled $16 billion of NFIP’s debt to  enable FEMA to continue paying flood claims. This reduced FEMA’s  debt to Treasury to $20.5 billion.\nMarch 2020: FEMA’s debt to Treasury remained at $20.5 billion.\nSeptember 2020: NFIP’s current short-term authorization ends.\nAppendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nthe caudate lobe lies deep in the liver , between the hepatic hila and the retrohepatic inferior vena cava ( ivc ) , and is adjacent to the major hepatic veins in its upper part .\nalthough the caudate lobe constitutes only a small part of the whole liver , it has the same histologic structure and the same incidence of developing benign and malignant neoplasms as other hepatic segments in proportion to their volume .\npercutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation ( rfa ) for tumors in the caudate lobe are difficult to be carried out because of their spatial peculiarity .\nmultiple bilateral blood supplies from hepatic artery and portal vein make transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( tace ) less effective for malignant tumors in the lobe than those in the main lobes .\nsurgical resection is left the only radical solution for symptomatic benign tumors and malignant tumors confined to the lobe .\nisolated caudate lobectomy , a parenchyma - sparing procedure , is still a challenge for hepatobiliary surgeons , especially in cirrhotic patients .\n16 cases of isolated caudate lobectomy in our departments from january 2010 to december 2013 were reviewed to optimize the operation . according to kumon 's nomenclature ,\nthe caudate lobe consists of 3 portions : the spiegel lobe ( i.e. , couinaud 's segment i ) , the paracaval portion ( i.e. , couinaud 's segment ix ) , and the caudate process .\nthe spiegel lobe locates behind the lesser omentum , to the left of the retrohepatic ivc .\nthe paracaval portion , which is attached to the anterior surface of the retrohepatic ivc by the retrohepatic ligament and the short hepatic veins , lies to the right of the spiegel lobe .\nthe caudate process , the smallest part of the three , is a thin tongue - like projection between the ivc and the portal vein .\nisolated caudate lobectomy is to remove either part or total of the lobe surgically ( i.e. , isolated partial or complete caudate lobectomy ) .\nclassified hepatocellular carcinomas spread from the caudate lobe into five types , which were frequently adopted to describe all neoplasms that originated in the caudate lobe .\nthey were as follows : type 1 lesions : lesions in the upper part of the spiegel lobe;type 2 lesions : lesions in the lower part of the spiegel lobe;type 3 lesions : lesions in the paracaval portion;type 4 lesions : lesions in the caudate process;type 5 lesions : lesions spread from the whole caudate lobe . \n \ntype 1 lesions : lesions in the upper part of the spiegel lobe ; type 2 lesions : lesions in the lower part of the spiegel lobe ; type 3 lesions : lesions in the paracaval portion ; type 4 lesions : lesions in the caudate process ; type 5 lesions : lesions spread from the whole caudate lobe .\n16 cases of isolated caudate lobectomy were performed for neoplasms confined to the caudate lobe , including seven cases of hepatocellular carcinoma ( 7/16 , 43.75% ) , four cases of hepatic cavernous hemangioma ( 4/16 , 25% ) , one case of hepatocellular adenoma ( 1/16 , 6.25% ) , one case of inflammatory pseudotumor ( 1/16 , 6.25% ) , one case of hepatic hamartoma ( 1/16 , 6.25% ) , one case of mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma ( 1/16 , 6.25% ) , and one case of metastatic colonic cancer ( 1/16 , 6.25% ) .\nhepatitis b virus surface antigen was positive in all the seven cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and in the case of mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma , respectively , and hepatitis b virus surface antibody was positive in the case of hepatocellular adenoma .\nthe tumors were measured in the maximum diameter from 2  cm to 12  cm ( 4.91  cm in average ) . according to hasegawa et al\n. 's classification , there were one case of type 1 lesions , three cases of type 2 lesions , three cases of type 3 lesions , six cases of type 4 lesions , and three cases of type 5 lesions ( table 1 ) .\nisolated resection of the caudate lobe consisted of four major steps : mobilization of the lobe , outflow control by dividing the short hepatic veins behind the lobe , inflow control by dividing the portal triads to the lobe , and division of the hepatic parenchyma between the caudate lobe and the main liver . left side approach , or right side approach , or both left and right sides approach were adopted in the operation .\nthe sequence of the four steps and the surgical approach alternated according to the tumor 's location , size , texture , and nature . \n\nwas adopted for resection of small masses that originated in the spiegel lobe , especially type 2 lesions . after entering the abdominal cavity through a reversed l - shaped incision on the right upper quadrant of the belly , the round , falciform , left triangular , left coronary and hepatogastric ligaments\nthe retroperitoneum covering the left wall of the retrohepatic ivc was incised to free the left margin of the spiegel lobe .\nthen , the spiegel lobe was easily elevated from the retrohepatic ivc to expose the short hepatic veins to direct view as they were divided and ligated caudal cranially .\nthe left portal hilum was lifted ventrally to expose the portal triads to the spiegel lobe , which were divided and ligated subsequently .\nright side approach was adopted for resection of small masses that originated in the caudate process . after entering the abdominal cavity through a reversed l - shaped incision , the round , falciform , right triangular , right coronary and hepatorenal ligaments were divided in turn .\nthe liver was elevated from the retrohepatic ivc and rotated to the left to show the short hepatic veins , which were divided and ligated in a cranial direction . the possible inferior right hepatic vein ( irhv ) , which often enters the ivc near the right adrenal gland vein ,\nthe retrohepatic ligament was divided when necessary from the left lateral surface of the ivc through an incision on the lesser omentum .\nif the portal triads to the caudate process could be dissected easily , they would be divided in advance ; in reverse , they were controlled during dividing the liver parenchyma by cusa . \n\nleft and right side approach was adopted for resection of the majority of caudate masses .\na reversed l - shaped incision on the right upper quadrant was adequate in most both sides approach cases .\nthe transverse arm of the incision might be extended to the left subcostal region if necessary .\nthe falciform ligament was dissected to the ventral surface of the suprahepatic ivc to show the loose space between the right hepatic vein and the confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins .\nthe retroperitoneum covering the infrahepatic ivc and the left wall of the retrohepatic ivc ( referred to as makuuchi 's fascia in japanese literature ) was incised caudal cranially to the superior recess of the lesser sac to expose the entire retrohepatic ivc . at this time\nthe confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins , which enters the anterior left lateral wall of the suprahepatic ivc , was encircled by passing a vascular tape through the latent space surrounded by the dorsal surface of the two hepatic veins , the ventral surface of the ivc , and the tip of the caudate lobe .\nthe liver was lifted and all the short hepatic veins ( including the irhv ) were taken down and suture - ligated .\nthe hepatoduodenal ligament was loosened , and the duodenum and the pancreatic head were partly mobilized by kocher maneuver for better exposure of large caudate masses .\nafter the liver parenchyma between the caudate lobe and the main liver was transected , the tumors were removed en bloc .\ndivision of the ligament enabled the elevation of the caudate lobe from the caval vein .\nbut when an enlarged spiegel lobe embraced the ivc dorsally , it should be divided from the right side more conveniently .\nthe venous ligament ( i.e. , the arantius ' ligament ) lies in the sulcus of the ligamentum venosum and connects the left portal vein to the root of the left hepatic vein .\nthe venous ligament was divided near the left hepatic vein to partly release the tip of the caudate lobe and to facilitate the isolation of the confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins .\nthe hepatic pedicle was encircled with a vascular tape for possible temporary inflow control of the liver .\nafter complete mobilization of the liver and incision of the retroperitoneum that covers the infrahepatic ivc and the left wall of the retrohepatic ivc , the suprahepatic and infrahepatic ivc were isolated and encircled with vascular tapes easily in case of possible temporary total hepatic blood occlusion .\nthese veins were best approached from the right side when there was a huge tumor .\nthe portal hila were lifted to expose the portal triads to the caudate lobe , which originate mainly from the left hilum and secondarily from the bifurcation ( figure 2 ) .\nthe parenchymal bridge between the caudate lobe and segments iv , viii , and vii was transected by cusa .\nsome small inflow vasculatures and draining vessels to the main hepatic veins , which were difficult to be dissected and ligated beforehand , were divided during transecting the liver parenchyma .\nall 16 cases of isolated caudate lobectomy were accomplished successfully without death and severe complications . left side approach\nwas adopted in two cases ( 2/16 , 12.5% ) and right side approach in three cases ( 3/16 , 18.75% ) , while both sides approach in 11 cases ( 11/16 , 68.75% ) .\nestimated intraoperative blood loss ranged from 100  ml to 850  ml ( 356.25  ml in average ) and transfusion varied from 0 to 800  ml ( 137.5  ml in average ) .\npringle maneuver was adopted in six cases for temporary inflow control of the liver ( occlusion time ranged from 6  min to 13  min ) .\nthe confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins ( and the right hepatic vein in two cases ) was taped in five cases for regional outflow control .\nthe suprahepatic and infrahepatic ivc were encircled with vascular tapes in two cases , but neither needed total hepatic blood occlusion of the hepatic hila and the ivc at the same time .\nsmall leakage in the retrohepatic ivc or the major hepatic veins was encountered in five cases , which was repaired with prolene suture .\ntotal operative time ranged from 150  min to 270  min ( 211.25  min in average ) .\nno bile leakage was encountered , which was reported as the major complication after isolated caudate lobectomy .\nthe seven cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and the case of mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma were followed up from 6 to 28 months , with one death case due to liver failure and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the 26th month after operation and two cases of recurred hepatocellular carcinoma in the main liver , who thereafter received tace , percutaneous rfa , and systemic chemotherapy .\nthe regular hepatectomy techniques are seldom employed in the operation . the surgical strategy chosen for each patient\nmust be based on the patient 's idiographic situation . in the 16 cases of isolated caudate lobectomy ,\nleft side approach was adopted in two cases , right side approach in three cases , and combined left and right sides approach in 11 cases . left side approach\nis adopted for small lesions in the lower part of the spiegel lobe and right side approach for small lesions in the caudate process . combined\nleft and right sides approach is recommended for the majority of neoplasms in the caudate lobe [ 5 , 9 ] , especially for those that are bigger than 4  cm in diameter , those originating in the paracaval portion or in the whole caudate lobe , or those that are thought to be malignant tumors , which require total caudate lobectomy for clearance of the tumors .\nsymptomatic and continuously enlarging hepatic cavernous hemangioma also requires total caudate lobectomy before it reaches a nonresectable size .\nin fact , complete caudate lobectomy is technically easier and controllable than partial resection of the lobe .\nloosening the hepatoduodenal ligament and performing the kocher maneuver help to expose the caudate lobe better and provide more space for the operation .\nwhen a bulky caudate tumor protrudes into the space between the right and middle hepatic veins or compresses the major hepatic veins severely , the anterior transhepatic approach should be employed in addition [ 10 , 11 ] or combined lobectomy should be adopted .\nthorough medical imaging study of ct or / and mri scan and type - b ultrasonography before operation is mandatory to illuminate the anatomic relationship between the masses and the hepatic hila , the major hepatic veins , and the retrohepatic ivc and to rule out metastases of malignant tumors .\nalthough thrombosis in the portal vein is not thought to be a contraindication for isolated caudate lobectomy , ruling out thrombus in the portal vein and the ivc is important for the choice of strategy of treatment .\nusually it is easy to dissect and divide the short hepatic veins along a tumor - free plane on the ventral surface of the retrohepatic ivc unless the tumor has involved the caval wall substantially . unlike the high incidence of thrombosis in the portal vein or the retrohepatic ivc in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the main liver or hilar cholangiocarcinoma which have involved the caudate lobe , the incidence of thrombosis is much lower than that expected for caudate tumors . dissection and division of the short hepatic veins\nexposure of the entire course of the retrohepatic ivc by incising the covered retroperitoneum is of utmost importance .\nthe superior recess of the lesser sac extends rightwards behind the spiegel lobe and the retrohepatic ivc .\nthe short hepatic veins are first divided before the portal triads to separate the caudate lobe from the ivc , in case of removing the lobe quickly after temporary hemostasis of a possible huge bleeding from a parenchymal laceration or a tear in the major hepatic veins by pringle maneuver .\nlarge short hepatic veins should be tied and sutured on the hepatic side . on the caval side\n, the large dissected end should be repaired with prolene suture after applying a side - wall vascular clamp .\nthe largest short hepatic vein drains the bulkiest part of the caudate lobe , which locates predominantly in the middle of the spiegel lobe and secondarily around the central part of the paracaval portion .\n. a medium - sized short hepatic vein that drains the tip of the caudate lobe to the left hepatic vein or the nearby ivc is sometimes found , which should be ligated with care so as not to be torn .\na broken hepatic vein is repaired more conveniently after the caudate lobe is moved out as it is facilitated by pringle maneuver . if combined with occlusion of the confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins ( and sometimes the right hepatic vein ) , a more clear operative field is presented with less possibility of air embolism . in contrast ,\nthe caudate lobe attaches to the ivc circumferently by retrohepatic ligament and adheres to the caudal side of left liver by the venous ligament . when the caudate lobe is small or when the tumor locates mainly in the caudate process , the retrohepatic ligament is divided from the left side easily .\nbut when the caudate lobe is enlarged , especially when it embraces the retrohepatic ivc dorsally with a bulky spiegel lobe , the retrohepatic ligament should be divided from the right side .\ndivision of the retrohepatic ligament makes it much easier to elevate the caudate lobe from the ventral surface of the retrohepatic ivc , facilitates the exposure and division of the short hepatic veins , and contributes to the isolation of the main hepatic veins likewise .\nthe irhv should be divided beforehand , which will facilitate the management of the other short hepatic veins from the right side .\nthe division of the venous ligament loosens the cranial polar of the caudate lobe , facilitates mobilizing the caudate lobe from the left side , provides more space for encircling the left and middle hepatic veins , and minimizes the possibility of injuring the veins .\nhepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs after hepatitis b in china , no matter where the first tumor appears .\nafter the original hepatic cancer in the caudate lobe is resected , the tumor may easily recur in the main liver lobes .\nclose follow - up of these patients at an interval of one to two months is necessary .\nchemotherapy , transarterial embolization or chemoembolization , percutaneous rfa , and alcohol injection are adopted to reduce the possibility of recurrence or to treat a recurred tumor .\nmany authors have reported comparable ( or even better ) survival rate after isolated resection of caudate hepatocellular carcinoma with those in the main liver [ 1 , 14 , 15 ] , which suggests that isolated caudate lobectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe is practical . in summary , left and right side approach is adopted for isolated resection of most neoplasms in the caudate lobe .\nmobilizing the whole caudate lobe is more important than enucleating the tumor itself in the operation . considering the patients ' safety as well as eradication of the diseases ,\nthe best surgical strategy is the one that is uncomplicated and easy to be mastered by most hepatobiliary surgeons , with fewer traumas and complications . and under the principle of mobilizing the caudate lobe firstly , controlling the outflow and then inflow vessels secondly , and dividing the liver parenchyma thirdly , it is advised that the relatively easier and safer step should be carried out first .\nfor example , some short hepatic veins can be divided while dividing the retrohepatic ligament ; and some portal triads to the caudate lobe can be divided while dividing the liver parenchyma .\npatients with malignant tumors should be followed up regularly after operation for recurrence and for adjuvant therapy . \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

", "response": "\n\nThis article investigates the feasibility and optimal surgical approach for isolated caudate lobectomy, a parenchyma-sparing procedure for treating benign and malignant tumors confined to the caudate lobe of the liver. The authors retrospectively analyzed 16 cases of isolated caudate lobectomy performed at their institution between 2010 and 2013.\n\nThe caudate lobe, a small segment of the liver strategically located deep within the abdomen, presents unique \nsurgical challenges due to its complex vascular anatomy. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is often less effective in this region, while percutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are technically difficult. This emphasizes the importance of surgical resection as a radical solution for symptomatic tumors in the caudate lobe.\n\nThe study examined different surgical approaches based on tumor location and size. For small masses in the lower spiegel lobe (part of the caudate lobe), a left-sided approach was employed. For small masses in the caudate process, a right-sided approach was preferred. In the majority of cases, involving larger tumors or those located in the paracaval portion, a combined left and right-sided approach proved most effective.\n\nThe authors emphasize the importance of meticulous surgical technique, particularly in controlling the outflow and inflow vessels to the caudate lobe. This involves careful dissection and ligation of the short hepatic veins, which drain the caudate lobe directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC). The portal triads, supplying blood to the caudate lobe, are also meticulously divided. \n\nKey findings of the study include:\n\n- All 16 cases of isolated caudate lobectomy were successfully performed without mortality or severe complications.\n\n- Left-sided approach was used in 2 cases, right-sided approach in 3 cases, and combined left and right-sided approach in 11 cases.\n\n- Estimated intraoperative blood loss ranged from 100 ml to 850 ml, with an average of 356.25 ml.\n\n- Pringle maneuver (temporary occlusion of the hepatic artery and portal vein) was used in 6 cases for inflow control.\n\n- The confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins (and the right hepatic vein in 2 cases) was temporarily occluded in 5 cases for regional outflow control.\n\n- No bile leakage occurred, a significant complication commonly associated with isolated caudate lobectomy.\n\n- Follow-up of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma revealed one death due to liver failure and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage 26 months post-surgery.\n\n- Two patients experienced recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the main liver, necessitating further treatment with TACE, percutaneous RFA, and systemic chemotherapy.\n\nThe study concludes that isolated caudate lobectomy, when performed with meticulous surgical technique and a tailored approach based on individual patient factors, is a safe and effective treatment for tumors confined to the caudate lobe.\n\n\n\n"}

Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: the market range unlimited meaning international\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: and the production cost should not exceed {disfmarker} hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro .\nMarketing: Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Profit . Um is fifty mm .\nProject Manager: So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design {vocalsound} to materials , cost , etcetera . Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ?\nMarketing: Oops .\nProject Manager: I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em {disfmarker} we use 'em , right , everyday .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? Would you like it to be smaller , bigger ,\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly {disfmarker} better marked buttons , you know , things like that ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Small , right . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Audio player . Oh . Okay .\nProject Manager: So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically .\nUser Interface: Yes , exactly Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Divides us {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Exactly .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} At um twelve fifty Euros per {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well .\nMarketing: Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} We certainly can try to {disfmarker} I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .\nProject Manager: It should be something new {disfmarker} it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have .\nMarketing: That's right .\nProject Manager: Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , of course .\nUser Interface: Yeah , design should be , yeah {disfmarker} it should be different . All the {disfmarker} almost all the remotes {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should {disfmarker} different colours or materials or you know .\nUser Interface: Yes , exactly .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , maybe ten {disfmarker} I do yeah , colours\nUser Interface: Are different shapes .\nIndustrial Designer: and al shapes also . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nProject Manager: Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know .\nUser Interface: Yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah of course yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap ,\nProject Manager: Yes .\nMarketing: because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That is true ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And and they {disfmarker} suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my {vocalsound} my remote control yeah ?\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal .\nMarketing: So some {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , some beep or something like that ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Or a b\nMarketing: Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink .\nIndustrial Designer: so that we can go {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So if lost {disfmarker} If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know .\nUser Interface: Should ha\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: A fluorescent signal , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm 'kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .\nProject Manager: Exactly , I mean just {vocalsound} that's what I'm saying .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . May not be beep .\nProject Manager: I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light .\nMarketing: And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond {disfmarker} what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?\nProject Manager: Okay , my {disfmarker} my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it {disfmarker} a light s sensors , you know ?\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep ,\nMarketing: Okay so {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yes .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , probably {disfmarker} yeah , probably it's a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .

Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design .\nProject Manager: Then {disfmarker} And then the technical funct you are the technical function ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , functional design ,\nProject Manager: so so you are the working design .\nIndustrial Designer: and you {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So you have a working design and then a functional design .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . And , of course , price . That it , that it , that the price is a good price . I mean , the price is given , but , that was {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .\nProject Manager: That's right . That's right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah .

the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is less than one people per thousand and subclinical hyperthyroidism prevalence is 4.2 people per thousand .\nmental health is considered as one of the most important indicators of the health and hygiene of a society and is mainly affirmed by the psychologists and other scientists of behavioral and social sciences ;

this can be because of lower social and individual \n adaptation skills in patients with lower education levels to withstand the problems of the disease .\ntherefore , patients with higher education levels have better physical conditions and lower anxiety levels . \n  our results are also compatible with other studies results regarding the comparison of the quality of life of patients with hypothyroidism and normal people .\nthe quality of life of patients with different \n types of thyroid gland cancer undergoing tsh- suppressive thyroxin therapy was assessed in an investigation .\nthese patients were considered as a model of subclinical hyperthyroidism . finally , the results showed \n that restoration of euthyroidism ( normal function of thyroid gland ) had no effect on the quality of life of these patients .\nbut the results of a similar study comparing \n the mental health condition and the quality of life of patients with hypothyroidism with the normal people were different .\nit was seen that the quality of life of these patients was lower than the normal people in \n the mentioned study . also , another study implied the lower level of quality of life in patients with auto - immune hypothyroidism .\nthis difference can be due to the varieties of the study population , culture and the type of investigation tool . in this regard\n, the results of a review study on evaluating tools of signs and condition of health \n and quality of life of hypothyroid patients showed that many of using tools were not appropriate to the purpose of the investigations ; hence , they can increase or alter the results .\nmoreover , there are some compatible studies about the significant correlation between mental health and the quality of life in patients with hypothyroidism . in a study\nperformed to investigate the \n relationship between mental health and quality of life of patients with coronary arteries disorders , this relationship was reported as significant .\nunfortunately , \n in studies performed to compare the \n quality of life and mental health of patients with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and irritable bowel syndrome ( ibs ) , \n only the results of the quality of life comparison and mental health comparison between 2 groups were reported , but no results regarding the existence or otherwise of the relationship between the two mentioned variables in one group were reported . \n  in this study , most of the subjects were male with a mean age of 38.93 . in comparison with this result , the other study reported the prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism \n more in female , respectively .\nthis result disagrees with that of the current study and it can be due to the selection of subjects from one center . \n\nbut another study conducted on hypothyroidism patients over 18 years of age , reported that the mean age of the subjects was 44 years old . \n\ntherefore , it is recommended that in the future studies in this field , multi - central sampling should be considered . \n \nthe most important limitation of the present study was the selection of patients from only one specialized clinic ( of course , it is the most active clinic in this field in the south of iran ) . \n\ntherefore , generalization of the results of this study to larger fields must be performed with caution and in order to increase the extension capability of these findings , the population and sample size must be larger \n and multiple . also , the use of several diagnostic methods for the selection of normal people in future studies is recommended . \n\nwith regard to the results of the present study indicating lower levels of mental health in patients with hypothyroidism , holding educational programs and protocols \n about this disease to improve the mental health is suggested .\nalso , these results indicate the relationship between mental health and quality of life ;

Data collection was conducted using a three-part questionnaire encompassing demographic information, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to assess mental health, and the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire to measure quality of life.\n\nThe results revealed a statistically significant difference in mental health scores between the two groups. Hypothyroid patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression compared to the control group.

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade deal fight led by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday failed to fully materialize as rival and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton announced a compromise to expand mandatory healthcare funding over the next decade. \n \n Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to the General Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church during their annual convention at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., July 8, 2016. REUTERS/Charles Mostoller \n \n At a meeting of the Democratic Party draft platform committee in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday, supporters of Sanders were unable to influence the committee to adopt strong language opposing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, marking a powerful blow to the efforts by the U.S. senator from Vermont to push the party further to the left. \n \n “We did everything we could to win that vote,” said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. “It was very disappointing.” \n \n Instead of a condemnation specific to the TPP, the committee reached language saying they would oppose “trade agreements that do not support good American jobs.” \n \n Sanders has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it, which he says are unfair to American workers. Clinton has also come out as opposed to the agreement. \n \n Despite Clinton having already secured the requisite delegates to clinch the party’s nomination at the July 25-28 convention, Sanders remains in the race to be the party’s nominee. \n \n He has indicated that he would hold off on endorsing Clinton for the Nov. 8 general election fight against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump until she adopted policies and campaign language that more closely resembled his own more liberal tone. \n \n “I would like to say that while this vote was disappointing, we have won some tremendous victories,” Gunnels said, including securing language in the draft supporting a federal $15 minimum wage, another trademark issue for Sanders. \n \n On the same day, the Clinton campaign announced changes to its healthcare policy proposal, including increasing mandatory healthcare funding under the Affordable Care Act by $40 billion over the next 10 years, highlighting the significant influence Sanders still yields over the party. \n \n “We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America,” Clinton said in a statement that included her intention to give Americans the choice of a public-option insurance plan and allow for individuals below Medicare age, beginning at 55, to opt in to the U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans’ hospital bills. \n \n Sanders has made combating healthcare costs a rallying cry of his campaign and often battled with Clinton during the primary race on how best to reach their shared goal of universal healthcare. \n \n On Saturday, Sanders praised the updates to Clinton’s proposal as a step in the right direction to “save lives and ease suffering,” indicating, along with the more liberal tone in several parts of the 2016 platform draft, a growing compromise between the two camps. \n \n For Clinton, an endorsement from Sanders - seen as a champion of the progressive left - could open the door to many of his supporters who have been reluctant to support the more moderate Clinton. \n \n “The proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America - and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans,” he said in a statement. \n \n Slideshow (2 Images) \n \n “I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative.” \n \n The New York Times reported on Thursday that an endorsement is imminent, and Sanders is expected to officially throw his support behind Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire early next week. \n \n (This story corrects age at which individuals could opt in to Medicare under Clinton plan in paragraph 10) ||||| Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.t, right, speaks as Hillary Clinton listens during the CNN Democratic Presidential Primary Debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York on April 14, 2016. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) \n \n WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton on Saturday announced her plan to expand investments in community health care centers, the second of two proposals in a week apparently aimed at courting supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of his possible endorsement. \n \n The presumptive Democratic nominee's proposal would double funding for primary care services at Federally Qualified Health Centers, which serve populations with limited access to health care. Community health care centers have been a key priority for Sanders, I-Vt., who successfully fought for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for such centers in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. \n \n Clinton also affirmed her commitment to giving Americans in every state the choice of a \"public-option\" insurance plan — which she supported during her 2008 presidential campaign and Sanders pushed for during the ACA debate — and allowing people below Medicare age to opt into the programby offering it to those who are 55 and older. \n \n An hour after her health care announcement, Clinton's campaign announced firm details about her Tuesday campaign event in Portsmouth, N.H., where Sanders is expected to endorse his primary campaign rival. The announcement does not mention Sanders. \n \n \"We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,\" Clinton said in a statement. \"Already, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.\" \n \n Sanders, in a press call timed 15 minutes after Clinton's announcement, said the proposal by Clinton — \"working with our campaign\" — is an important step forward in expanding access to health care and addressing a crisis in primary health care. \n \n \"It will save lives, it will ease suffering, it will improve health care in America and it will cut health care costs,\" he said. \"It is a significant step forward as we advance toward the goal of health care for for all Americans.\" \n \n The announcement follows a higher education proposal Clinton released Wednesday that Sanders called a “bold initiative” to “revolutionize the funding of higher education in America.” That proposal is designed to eliminate college tuition for working families and reduce debt. \n \n Sanders was asked if he is now in a position to endorse Clinton. \n \n \"It’s fair to say that the Clinton campaign and our campaign are coming closer and closer together in trying to address the major issues facing this country, which is what my campaign was all about, and we look forward to continue working with the Clinton campaign and will have more to say in the very near future,\" he said. \n \n Sanders has long called for a \"Medicare-for-all\" proposal that would grant all Americans access to health care through a single-payer national program. During the primary campaign, Clinton questioned how he'd pay for his proposal and said she wants to defend and build on the progress made by the Affordable Care Act. She accused him during a debate of wanting to \"tear (the ACA) up and start over again,\" a claim he rejected. \n \n Her proposal Saturday would extend the current mandatory funding for community health centers and expand it by $40 billion over the next 10 years. A Clinton campaign official said the proposal would be fully paid for with savings, innovations and tax reform that closes loopholes and \"makes the wealthiest pay their fair share.\" \n \n Community health centers provide care for about 25 million people in the United States, more than half of whom are Hispanic or African Americans, according to the Clinton campaign. Sanders said the centers offer savings to the overall health care system of $49 billion a year, and access to health care when people need it avoids costly illnesses, hospital stays and trips to the emergency room. \n \n \"These are good investments for patients and these are very good investments for taxpayers,\" he said. He said Clinton's efforts to provide Americans with the choice of a public-option insurance plan and to expand Medicare \"will get us closer to the day when everyone in America has access to quality, affordable health care.” \n \n Clinton's announcement came on a day when Democrats in Orlando were finalizing the party platform they will bring to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia later this month. \n \n The 187-member Platform Committee voted down an amendment by a Sanders supporter that would have blocked a vote in Congress on the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation trade pact that Sanders says will hurt U.S. workers and the environment. But they approved an amendment by a Clinton representative that, without explicitly opposing the TPP, says that Democrats will oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs, raise wages and improve national security. \n \n Platform language aimed at blocking the TPP was a top priority for Sanders. Warren Gunnels, Sanders' policy director, said the campaign is \"very disappointed\" that the Sanders-backed amendment failed, but he said it's \"good news\" that virtually everyone who spoke during the debate made it clear they oppose the TPP. \n \n \"Sen. Sanders, Sec. Clinton and the overwhelming majority of Democrats agree: the TPP should not come up for a vote after the election,\" Gunnels said in a statement. \"If Democrats are going to prevail in November we must make clear to the American people that we stand firmly against the TPP. We will continue fighting to protect American jobs and to ensure Congress does not pass this disastrous trade agreement.\" \n \n Sanders has said he is prepared to bring amendments to the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia if the party doesn’t take more progressive stances in its platform. A convention floor fight seems unlikely now, given his confirmation that he is preparing to endorse Clinton. \n \n Follow @ngaudiano on Twitter. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/29qNDpD ||||| Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her support on Saturday for creating a “public option” within Obamacare and allowing people to enroll in Medicare at age 55. \n \n The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also called for a substantial increase in funding in medical clinics that serve low-income Americans, fully embracing a proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \n \n While Clinton has long supported the creation of new government-run insurance options and reiterated that support several times this year, Saturday’s statement comes three days before she is scheduled to make her first joint campaign appearance with Sanders ― who has championed government-run insurance and federally financed clinics throughout his career and during his own bid for the presidency. \n \n Sanders, who ran a surprisingly strong but ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination, is expected to endorse Clinton at that Tuesday event. Saturday’s announcement on health policy follows a similar one from Clinton earlier in the week, that she was enhancing her own proposal on college tuition assistance to match the considerably more generous version Sanders had sketched out. \n \n In describing the proposals to The Huffington Post, senior Clinton campaign aides noted that Sanders had championed these ideas ― and, in particular, that the former Secretary of State’s funding proposal for the clinics matched one that the independent senator had made. \n \n Already, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. Hillary Clinton \n \n “We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,” Clinton said in a press release that the campaign circulated late Saturday morning. “Already, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.” \n \n Sanders said in a conference call shortly afterwards that the announcement was the product of discussion between the two campaigns. He praised Clinton’s proposal in strong, unambiguous terms ― describing it as “an extremely important initiative” and predicting that “it will save lives, it will ease suffering, it will improve health care in America, and it will cut health care costs.” \n \n The idea of the public option ― as first sketched out by Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist ― is to create a separate, government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers offering coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. The hope is that this competition can help keep premiums for all the insurance plans low, particularly if the government-run plan has the ability to dictate low reimbursement rates to doctors, hospitals, drugmakers, and other suppliers of medical care. \n \n President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders included versions of the public option in their proposals when they first began working on health care reform in 2009. But they ended up jettisoning the idea in response to protests from more conservative Democrats, who were less enthusiastic about government programs and industry groups, like hospitals and insurance companies, that feared what a public option would do to their income streams. \n \n The idea of a Medicare buy-in has been around for even longer, although it, too, appeared in 2009 when Democrats were drawing up health care legislation. The goal, again, would be to give consumers ― in this case, those older than 55 and at greater risk of becoming sick ― one more insurance option if they can’t get coverage through an employer or an existing government program. \n \n Clinton has expressed support for both ideas during the 2016 campaign, noting that she had called for them previously. (She made a public option part of her campaign proposal to reform health care in 2008.) But campaign aides said Saturday’s announcement is a reminder of how seriously she takes the idea ― and her determination to promote it as president. \n \n Jim Young / Reuters U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she’s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years. \n \n That might reassure some of the progressive Sanders supporters skeptical of Clinton’s commitment to their values and goals ― and, in some cases, angry at her attacks on Sanders’ proposal to create a single, government-run insurance plan that would provide coverage to all Americans, supplanting private insurance altogether. \n \n Of course, Clinton’s announcement comes with no policy details. She isn’t answering any of the many complicated questions that either proposal would raise ― like exactly how either the Obamacare public option or Medicare buy-in plan would pay the providers of medical services, or exactly who could enroll in either one. \n \n Clinton’s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she’s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years. She hasn’t identified new revenue or spending cuts to cover the cost of the proposal, but she has said that she will remain true to her pledge to pay for the price of any proposals ― a pledge that she has largely kept in this campaign, independent budget analysts say. \n \n And while the clinic proposal likely to get a lot less attention than anything Clinton says about the public option of Medicare, the idea, if implemented, could help a great many people get medical care. \n \n The clinics are the backbone of the nation’s health care safety net, providing primary care to millions of Americans who either have no health insurance or whose insurance doesn’t meet their needs ― a group that, even after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, is large and underserved. \n \n About one in 14 Americans currently gets health care through a federally funded clinic, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That’s thanks to annual funding of about $5 billion, a big chunk of which comes from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that Sanders championed. \n \n “This would be a substantial infusion of funding,” Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. “More funding for community health centers creates an infrastructure to care for increasing numbers of insured people and also provides resources to reach the remaining uninsured to encourage them to get covered.” \n \n Federal clinics happen to be one of the few government-run healthcare programs with a history of strong bipartisan support. George W. Bush was a big fan during his presidency, for example. So while both a public option and Medicare buy-in would likely run into the same political opposition that stopped them in 2009,more money for clinics would have a chance of becoming law even with Republicans controlling a house of Congress. \n \n This article has been updated to include more specific details on Clinton’s proposal and reactions to it. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_047", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nLetter\nAs of September 2018, almost half ($414 billion) of the $859 billion in  outstanding William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans (Direct Loans) was  being repaid by student loan borrowers using Income-Driven Repayment  (IDR) plans. These plans are designed to make loan repayment more  manageable by basing monthly payment amounts on borrowers’ income  and family size, extending repayment periods from the standard 10 years  to up to 25 years, and forgiving any loan balances remaining at the end of  the repayment period. The U.S. Department of Education (Education)  administers the Direct Loan program and contracts with private loan  servicers to handle billing and other tasks, including processing  borrowers’ applications for IDR plans.\nDirect Loan borrowers’ use of IDR plans has increased dramatically, with  total outstanding loan debt being repaid under these plans growing more  than 200 percent from September 2014 to September 2018. Our prior  work found that while IDR plans can benefit borrowers by reducing their  monthly payment amounts, they may carry high costs for taxpayers and  the government because of the possibility of loan forgiveness. Given  this, it is important that IDR borrowers’ monthly payment amounts be  based on accurate income and family size information. You asked us to  review Education’s verification procedures for IDR plans.\nThis report examines (1) whether there are indicators of potential fraud or  error in income and family size information provided by borrowers seeking  to repay their loans with IDR plans and (2) the extent to which Education  verifies this information.\nTo address these questions, we reviewed relevant IDR policies and  procedures from Education and its four largest student loan servicers, as  well as relevant laws and regulations. We also interviewed Education  officials from Federal Student Aid, the office responsible for developing  policies and procedures for administering IDR plans and overseeing how  loan servicers carry them out, as well as officials from Education’s four  largest loan servicers. We assessed Education’s procedures against (1)  federal standards for internal control, and (2) GAO’s Framework for  Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs.\nWe obtained data from Education’s Enterprise Data Warehouse and  Analytics (EDWA) database on borrowers with IDR plans approved  between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017, the most recent data  available at the time of our analysis. We also obtained national quarterly  wage data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’  (HHS) National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) for the same time period.  We conducted a match using these data to determine if any borrowers  that reported zero income on their IDR applications had wages reported  in NDNH in the same quarter in which their IDR plans were approved. For  these matches, we estimated whether the borrowers may have had  sufficient annual wages to warrant monthly student loan payments greater  than zero dollars. For detailed information about how we performed our  match, estimated borrowers’ annual wages, and limitations to our  approach, see appendix I. In addition, we analyzed family sizes reported  in Education’s data to gain insight into indicators of potential fraud or  error. Our results are not generalizable to all IDR plans and borrowers.\nWe assessed the reliability of Education’s and HHS’s data by reviewing  related documents, interviewing knowledgeable officials responsible for  each dataset, and performing electronic tests on specific data elements  used in our analyses. Additionally, for the Education data, we compared  the data to published Education data on IDR plans; validated a  nongeneralizable selection of borrower and loan information against loan  servicers’ records; and compared borrowers’ information with Social  Security Administration records. On the basis of our reliability assessment  results, we determined that the HHS data and parts of the Education data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We analyzed about 878,500  approved IDR plans held by about 656,600 borrowers for our income  analysis, and approximately 5 million approved IDR plans for over 3.5  million borrowers for our family size analysis. More details on our scope,  methodology, and limitations are included in appendix I.\nWe conducted this performance audit from June 2017 to June 2019, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\nThis report examines (1) whether there are indicators of potential fraud or  error in income and family size information provided by borrowers seeking  to repay their loans with Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans and (2)  the extent to which the Department of Education (Education) verifies this  information.\nTo address these questions, we reviewed relevant IDR policies and  procedures from Education and its four largest loan servicers—Navient,  Nelnet, Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc., and the  Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. We selected these  loan servicers because, at the time of our analysis, together they serviced  96 percent of the outstanding balance of loans being repaid with IDR  plans as of September 2017. We also interviewed Education officials  from Federal Student Aid, the office responsible for developing policies  and procedures for administering IDR plans and overseeing how loan  servicers carry them out, as well as the officials from the selected loan  servicers. Additionally, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations  and Education’s procedures for verifying information on the Free  Application for Federal Student Aid. We assessed Education’s  procedures against federal standards for internal control for developing  sufficient control activities, risk assessment, and information and  communication. We also assessed Education’s procedures against the  leading practices for data analytics activities in GAO’s Framework for  Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs.\nTo determine whether there were indicators of potential fraud or error in  borrowers’ income and family size information on IDR plans, we obtained  data from Education’s Enterprise Data Warehouse and Analytics (EDWA)  database on borrowers with William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans (Direct  Loans) and IDR plans approved between January 1, 2016 and  September 30, 2017, the most recent data available at the time of our analysis. EDWA is a centralized data warehouse that contains  administrative data reported by loan servicers on IDR borrowers and their  loans. Some borrowers had multiple approved IDR plans in the data we  analyzed. We also obtained national quarterly wage data from the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) National Directory of  New Hires (NDNH) for the same time period. NDNH is a national  repository of information reported by employers, states, and federal  agencies. The NDNH is maintained and used by HHS for the federal child  support enforcement program, which assists states in locating parents  and enforcing child support orders. In addition to information on newly  hired employees, NDNH contains (1) data on quarterly wages for existing  employees, collected and reported by state workforce agencies and  federal agencies; and (2) data on all individuals who apply for or received  unemployment compensation, as maintained and reported by state  workforce agencies.\nFor our analysis of borrower-reported incomes, we matched  approximately 656,600 Education borrowers to NDNH quarterly wage  data to determine if any borrowers who reported zero income on their IDR  applications had wages reported in the same quarter in which their IDR  plans were approved. We took additional steps to further review and  refine these matches and provide reasonable assurance that the NDNH  wage data were associated with the correct borrower by comparing (1)  the borrower’s state of residence as reported in the Education data to the  state agency submitting the NDNH wage data and (2) the borrower’s  name as reported in the Education data to the employee name reported  in the NDNH data. For the refined matches, we then estimated whether  the borrowers may have had sufficient annual wages based on wages  reported in NDNH to potentially warrant monthly student loan payments  greater than zero dollars on their associated IDR plan. Specifically, we  aggregated all NDNH wages reported for the borrower in the quarter in  which their IDR plan was approved to determine a total quarterly wage  amount. We then multiplied the total quarterly wage amount by four—the  number of quarters in a calendar year—to generate an estimate of annual  wages for the borrower. Our approach was based on the methodology  Education instructs loan servicers to use to calculate annual wages when  borrowers provide an alternative to a tax return to document their income  on IDR applications. This methodology may understate or overstate  income given that borrowers may not have earned the same amount in  each of the four quarters. Our estimates of annual wages are based on  the wages reported in NDNH for each borrower and do not take into  account any pre-tax deductions that may apply when determining IDR  payments. Our estimates of annual wages also do not include borrowers’  spousal income or any other taxable income for the borrower that is not  included in the NDNH quarterly wage data—such as unemployment  compensation received or unearned income such as alimony. We did not  independently verify the wages reported in NDNH or the actual total  annual income earned by borrowers identified in our match, as this was  outside the scope of our review.\nUsing the estimated annual wage, we then determined whether a  borrower would have had a monthly payment greater than zero by using  Education’s IDR plan repayment calculations for each IDR plan. To  calculate the monthly payment, we used (1) the estimated annual wage  from our NDNH data analysis; (2) the family size reported on the  borrower’s approved IDR plan; (3) the borrower’s approved IDR plan  type; and (4) the relevant percentage of the HHS poverty guideline  amount for the borrower’s family size, state of residence, IDR plan  approval year, and IDR plan type. For borrowers on Income-Based  Repayment, New Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, and  Revised Pay As You Earn plans, we rounded all calculated monthly  payments that were less than $5 down to zero, in accordance with  Education’s repayment calculations. We then identified which borrowers  had calculated payments that were greater than zero. We did not  determine the actual repayment amount borrowers may have had, as this  was outside the scope of our review. Finally, for borrowers for whom we  had calculated a payment greater than zero, we determined the total  outstanding Direct Loan balance (principal and accrued interest) as of  September 2017, based on EDWA data.\nFor our analysis of borrower-reported family sizes, we analyzed the  overall distribution of family sizes reported on approximately 5 million  approved IDR plans. We reviewed the percentile distribution for family  size on all IDR plans in our analysis and identified those in the top 1  percent of the data—in this case, IDR plans that had a reported family  size of nine or more. We defined these IDR plans as having atypical  family sizes for the Education data. We did not independently verify the  family size reported on the IDR plans. For the borrowers with family sizes  of nine or more, we determined the total outstanding Direct Loan balance  (principal and accrued interest) as of September 2017.\nTo examine the effects of borrowers inaccurately reporting income and  family size on loan payment amounts, we analyzed the estimated monthly  loan payment amounts for various hypothetical repayment scenarios from  Education’s online repayment estimator as of January 2019, which used  the 2018 HHS poverty guidelines. To examine the effect of various family  sizes on loan payment amounts, we assumed a hypothetical borrower  lived in the continental United States; had an adjusted gross income of  $40,000; an outstanding Direct Loan balance of $30,000 (close to the  average outstanding Direct Loan balance of $33,600 as of September  2018); and an interest rate of 5.1 percent (the Direct Loan 2018-2019  interest rate for an undergraduate borrower). To examine the effect of  various incomes on monthly payment amounts, we assumed hypothetical  borrowers had adjusted gross incomes based on estimated annual wages  common in our data matching analysis ($30,000, $45,000, and $60,000),  a family size of one (meaning just the borrower), and lived in the  continental United States. For this analysis, we also assumed  hypothetical borrowers had an interest rate of 5.1 percent and an  outstanding Direct Loan balance of $50,000, which we selected to be high  enough to qualify these hypothetical borrowers for all IDR plans at each  of the selected income levels.\nTo assess the reliability of the EDWA data, we reviewed documents  related to the database and Education loan data generally; interviewed  knowledgeable Education officials; performed electronic testing to  determine the validity of specific data elements that we used to perform  our work; compared the data we received to published Education data on  the number of IDR borrowers and amount of their outstanding loans; and  compared borrowers’ personal information to the Social Security  Administration’s Enumeration Verification System to identify borrowers  whose information may not have been accurate. As part of our reliability  assessment of the EDWA data, we selected a nongeneralizable sample  of 16 borrowers and their IDR plan and loan information from the EDWA  data to compare against four selected loan servicers’ records.  Specifically, we stratified borrowers into two groups based on common  and potentially outlying incomes and family sizes in the EDWA data. We  then randomly selected two borrowers from each stratum for each of the  four selected loan servicers (a total of four borrowers per loan servicer).  We reviewed all IDR plan data in our scope for each selected borrower,  including the plan type, family size, income, and total monthly payment.  We did not review original documents, such as the IDR applications or  documentation of income. We discussed the results of our review with  knowledgeable Education and loan servicer officials to gain additional  understanding of each selected borrower’s IDR plan information as well  as any differences between EDWA and loan servicer data.\nWe originally obtained EDWA data on approximately 6.5 million IDR plans  approved between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017 that were  held by almost 4.8 million Direct Loan borrowers. Based on data reliability  issues we identified during our review, we had to limit the scope of our  analysis to a subset of EDWA data that we determined were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Education officials disclosed issues that  impacted the IDR plan data reported to Education by one of its loan  servicers. Specifically, Education and the loan servicer had identified  instances where the loan servicer’s internal data were changed for valid  reasons but the changes were not reported to Education correctly. As a  result, we excluded data reported by this servicer from all analyses in our  report. We also identified issues with monthly payment amounts for some  borrowers in the EDWA data. Accordingly, we limited our borrower- reported income analysis to borrowers who reported zero income and had  a scheduled monthly payment of zero dollars. Ultimately, we analyzed  about 878,500 IDR plans held by about 656,600 borrowers for our income  analysis and approximately 5 million IDR plans held by 3.5 million  borrowers for our family size analysis. Consequently, our overall income  and family size analyses results may be understated and are not  generalizable to all IDR plans and borrowers.\nConsistent with our report scope, our analyses of borrower-reported  income focused on identifying indications of potential fraud or error;  however, our analyses do not show that fraud or error occurred. It is not  possible to determine whether fraud or error occurred through data  matching alone. As previously discussed, our estimates of annual wages  are based on the NDNH quarterly wage data, and do not take into  account any deductions that may be applicable for determining adjusted  gross income, which is used to determine IDR plan payment amounts. As  a result, our estimates could overstate borrowers’ incomes for IDR plan  purposes. Additionally, wages are reported in NDNH quarterly, so we are  not able to determine when in a quarter a borrower earned wages. For  example, a borrower may have earned wages at the start or end of a  quarter, but was not earning wages at the time of submitting the IDR  application. Because borrowers are only required to certify their income  annually, such a scenario would not constitute fraud or error even though  it would result in a match in our analysis. In addition, our use of  Education’s methodology to annualize wages based on quarterly wages  may understate or overstate income if a borrower did not earn wages at  the same level over the entire year. We are also not able to identify  additional taxable income that is not reported to NDNH but should have  been included on borrowers’ IDR applications, which could understate  borrowers’ incomes. Consequently, our analysis may overstate or  understate the number of borrowers who reported no income on their IDR  application yet may have had sufficient wages to warrant a monthly  student loan payment.\nTo assess the reliability of the NDNH data, we reviewed documents  related to the database, interviewed knowledgeable HHS officials, and  performed electronic testing to determine the validity of specific data  elements in the NDNH data that we used to perform our work. On the  basis of our own reliability assessment results, we determined that the  NDNH data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.\nWe conducted this performance audit from June 2017 to June 2019, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix II: Comments from the U.S. Department of Education\nAppendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nLetter\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) manages a global real-estate portfolio  with an estimated replacement value of almost $1.2 trillion, including  installations in all regions of the continental United States, Alaska, and  Hawaii, as well as in foreign locations. These installations not only  provide services and support to servicemembers and their families, but  are critical to maintaining military readiness. Since 2010, DOD has  identified climate change as a threat to its operations and installations  and stated that the department needs to adapt its infrastructure to the  risks posed by climate change. In January 2019, DOD stated in a report  to Congress that the effects of a changing climate are a national security  issue with potential impacts to the department’s missions, operational  plans, and installations.\nThe effects of climate change, such as sea level rise, may damage  infrastructure and result in increased costs to the department. These  costs are projected to increase as extreme weather events become more  frequent and intense as a result of climate change—as observed and  projected by the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National  Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. According to the  U.S. Global Change Research Program’s Fourth National Climate  Assessment, the effects of climate change are already being felt in the  United States and are projected to intensify in the future. These effects  will include increases in the incidence of extreme high temperatures,  heavy precipitation events, high tide flooding events along the coastline,  and forest fires in the western continental United States and Alaska. The  assumption that current and future climate conditions will resemble those  of the recent past is no longer valid, according to the report. For example,  sea levels are expected to continue to rise along almost all U.S.  coastlines.\nWe and others, such as the National Academies of Sciences,  Engineering, and Medicine, have therefore recommended enhancing  climate resilience as one strategy to help limit the federal government’s  fiscal exposure. Enhancing climate resilience means being able to plan  and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to  climate-related impacts, such as those identified by the U.S. Global  Change Research Program in the 2018 Fourth National Climate  Assessment. Examples of resilience measures to protect infrastructure  include raising river or coastal dikes to reduce the risks to infrastructure  from sea level rise, building higher bridges, and increasing the capacity of  stormwater systems. Enhancing climate resilience can add additional  costs up front, but could also reduce potential future costs incurred as a  result of damage from climate-related events.\nAs a result of the significant risks posed by climate change, in February  2013, we placed Limiting the Federal Government’s Fiscal Exposure by  Better Managing Climate Change Risks on our High-Risk List. As part of  our work in this high-risk area, in 2015 we reported that the climate  information needs of federal, state, local, and private-sector decision  makers were not being fully met and that a national climate information  system could help them make more informed decisions about managing  climate change risks. We made two recommendations, including that the  Executive Office of the President develop a set of authoritative climate  change projections for use in federal decision making, but as of May  2018, the Executive Office of the President had yet to take action in  response. In 2016 we reported that improved federal coordination could  facilitate the use of forward-looking climate information in facilities design  standards and building codes, the technical guidelines that promote the  safety, reliability, productivity, and efficiency of infrastructure. We made  one recommendation—that the Director of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology at the Department of Commerce convene an  ongoing government-wide effort to provide the best available forward- looking climate information to standards-developing organizations for  consideration in design standards and building codes. As of May 2018,  our recommendation had not been implemented.\nWe have also previously reported on the risks of extreme weather and  climate change effects to DOD installations. In 2014, we reported on the  risks that climate change posed to DOD’s domestic installations, and in  2017 we issued a related report on risks that climate change posed to  DOD’s foreign installations. We discuss our findings and  recommendations from these reports in more depth later in this report.\nSenate Report 115-130, accompanying a bill for fiscal year 2018  appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and related agencies, cited concerns with the frequency and costs  of extreme weather events and the potential effects of climate change  and included a provision for us to review DOD’s progress in developing a  means to account for potentially damaging weather in its facilities project  designs. This report examines the extent to which DOD has taken steps  to incorporate resilience to extreme weather and climate change effects  into (1) installation master plans and related planning documents, and (2)  individual installation facilities projects.\nFor objective one, we reviewed DOD policies, guidance, and standards  related to increasing climate resilience and conducting installation master  planning. We interviewed officials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Sustainment, each of the military departments involved  with installation policy, and the engineering organizations of each military  department. We also visited or requested information from a non- generalizable sample of 23 domestic military installations, plus an Air  Force unit with responsibility for certain facilities in Alaska because these  facilities are affected by severe coastal erosion. To develop this sample  we focused on domestic installations because our November 2017 report  focused on foreign installations. We selected installations that had  identified one or more climate-related vulnerabilities based on their past  experiences in a DOD-administered survey of climate vulnerabilities at  DOD installations or in a prior GAO report on weather and climate risks at  DOD installations. We visited 10 of these installations, plus the Air Force  unit in Alaska, and sent the remaining 13 installations a questionnaire.\nWe then reviewed documents from all the installations in our sample,  including master plans. We compared DOD’s actions to take steps in  installation planning to increase resilience with DOD guidance on climate  change resilience, Unified Facilities Criteria standards, federal internal  control standards, and best practices for enterprise risk management.\nFor objective two, we reviewed DOD guidance related to increasing  climate resilience. We also reviewed DOD standards for facilities project  design to determine the extent to which they require or give guidance on  climate resilience measures and the extent to which they incorporate  guidance on using climate projections. We obtained information from  each of the installations in our sample on the extent to which they had  incorporated climate resilience measures into specific projects and  reviewed project design documents. We compared the extent to which  DOD took steps in its facilities projects and its project design standards to  increase resilience with DOD guidance on climate change resilience. See  appendix I for more information on our objectives, scope, and  methodology.\nWe conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to June 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix I: Scope and Methodology\nSenate Report 115-130, accompanying a bill for fiscal year 2018  appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and related agencies, cited concerns with the frequency and costs  of extreme weather events and the potential effects of climate change,  and included a provision for us to review the Department of Defense’s  (DOD) progress in developing a means to account for potentially  damaging weather in its project designs. In response to this provision,  we examined the extent to which DOD has taken steps to incorporate  resilience to extreme weather and climate change effects into (1)  installation master plans and related planning documents, and (2)  individual installation facilities projects.\nFor both of our objectives, we visited or requested information from a  sample of domestic military installations. We focused on domestic  installations because our November 2017 report focused on foreign  installations. To develop this sample, we selected installations in the  continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories that had  identified one or more climate-related vulnerabilities, based on their past  experiences, in a DOD-administered survey of climate vulnerabilities, or  installations that were referenced in a prior GAO report on weather and  climate risks at DOD installations. In addition to these criteria, we  selected sites that represented both a diversity in types of climate  vulnerabilities and geographic diversity among the military services, as  well as installations involved in any climate change-related pilot studies.  From these criteria, we developed a non-generalizable sample of 23  installations. We also included in the sample one Air Force unit (not an  installation) with responsibilities for particular facilities of interest in  Alaska, because these facilities presented a climatic vulnerability  (accelerating coastal erosion) that was not necessarily included  elsewhere in the sample.\nWe visited 10 of these installations, as well as the Air Force unit in  Alaska, in person. Within the sample, we selected installations to visit  based on geographic diversity and installations in proximity to each other,  allowing us to visit multiple installations on each trip. For the remaining 13  installations, we developed and administered a questionnaire and  document request. We received responses from 12 of these installations.  One installation—Camp Lejeune—sustained significant damage from  Hurricane Florence in September 2018, and to minimize the burden on  installation officials’ time to respond, we met with them by phone. Results  from our nongeneralizable sample cannot be used to make inferences  about all DOD locations. However, the information from these installations  provides valuable insights. We asked similar questions to installations on  our site visits and in the questionnaires, and we collected similar  documents—such as installation master plans and individual facilities  project documents— allowing us to report on similar information, such as  the extent to which extreme weather and climate change considerations  were integrated into installation master plans and individual facilities  projects.\nFor objective one, we reviewed DOD policies, guidance, and standards  related to increasing climate resilience and conducting installation master  planning. These documents included, among others, DOD Directive  4715.21, which establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for DOD to  assess and manage risks associated with climate change; DOD’s Unified  Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning, which  establishes the requirements for installation master plans; and a  memorandum from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics on floodplain management on DOD  installations. We interviewed officials in the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Sustainment and the Strategic Environmental  Research and Development Program. We also interviewed officials in  each of the military departments, including officials involved with  installation policy, as well as officials from the engineering organizations  of each military department and officials in the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration to discuss climate science and the data  potentially available for planners to use. We reviewed documents from  each of the 23 installations and the one Air Force unit in our sample,  including master plans, and used interviews with installation officials and  questionnaires received from installations to determine the extent to  which the installations had incorporated consideration of extreme weather  and climate change effects into their installation plans. We compared  DOD’s actions to take steps in installation planning to increase resilience  to extreme weather and climate change effects with DOD guidance on  climate change adaptation and resilience, Unified Facilities Criteria  standards, federal internal control standards, and best practices for  enterprise risk management.\nFor objective two, we reviewed DOD guidance, including DOD Directive  4715.21, requiring DOD components to integrate climate change  considerations into DOD plans. We also reviewed DOD’s facilities project  design standards—the Unified Facilities Criteria—to determine the extent  to which installations incorporated requirements for climate resilience and  to identify any required or recommended climate data sources for facilities  project design. Specifically, we reviewed the 27 core Unified Facilities  Criteria standards, as well as 3 other Unified Facilities Criteria standards  outside of the core 27—because of their broad relevance to project  design—and one facility criteria on Navy and Marine Corps design  procedures. Additionally, we performed a content analysis of these  criteria for references to climate, weather, environment, and any climate  data to be used as a basis for facilities design. We also identified any  required or recommended climate data sources or tools for facilities  design by searching for references, web links, or tables related to climate  data within the criteria. Where climate data sources were identified, we  reviewed them to determine the extent to which the sources and tools  involved historical data or climate projections that anticipate future climate  conditions. We interviewed officials from the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Air Force Civil  Engineer Center to understand the extent to which the Unified Facilities  Criteria include guidance or data sources for adapting DOD facilities to  extreme weather and climate change effects.\nIn addition, we used interviews with installation officials and  questionnaires we received from installations to determine the extent to  which the installations had planned or executed any military construction  or sustainment, restoration, and modernization facilities projects since  2013 that included any elements for building resilience to extreme  weather or climate change effects. We then reviewed project  documentation for proposed or approved facilities projects to identify the  resilience measures taken. We also observed some facilities-related  climate resilience measures adopted by these installations. In addition,  we interviewed officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment to determine what plans, if any, the office had to  update Unified Facilities Criteria with climate resilience requirements. We  also interviewed officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Installations, Energy and Environment; the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations and  Environment; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force,  Installations, Environment and Energy to identify any actions, policies, or  processes related to adapting facilities to extreme weather and climate  change effects. Moreover, we interviewed officials from the American  Society of Civil Engineers to understand what efforts, if any, had been  made to incorporate climate projections into industry standards. Finally,  we compared the extent to which DOD took steps in its facilities projects  and its project design standards to increase resilience with DOD guidance  on climate change resilience.\nTable 3 lists the locations we visited or contacted during this review,  including the installations receiving our questionnaire.\nAppendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense\nAppendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nRelated GAO Products\nHigh-Risk Series: Substantial Efforts Needed to Achieve Greater  Progress on High-Risk Areas, GAO-19-157SP.

", "response": "\n\n\nThis report examines the Department of Defense's (DOD) efforts to incorporate climate change resilience into its infrastructure planning and facilities projects. With a vast real estate portfolio valued at over $1.2 trillion, DOD recognizes climate change as a significant threat, potentially impacting its missions and operational plans.\n\nThe report highlights the increasing risks posed by climate change, including sea level rise, extreme weather events, and wildfires, leading to potential infrastructure damage and increased costs for DOD. It emphasizes the need for climate resilience measures, such as raising dikes, building higher bridges, and enhancing stormwater systems, to mitigate these risks. While these measures may require upfront investments, they can ultimately reduce future costs associated with climate-related damage.\n\nThe report acknowledges that DOD has taken some steps to address climate change, including issuing guidance on climate change adaptation and resilience. However, it criticizes the department for not fully integrating climate considerations into its installation master plans and facilities projects.\n\nKey findings of the report include:\n\n* DOD has not consistently incorporated climate resilience measures into installation master plans and facilities projects.\n* The department's Unified Facilities Criteria, which provide design standards for facilities, lack comprehensive guidance on integrating climate projections into project designs.\n* DOD has not fully implemented recommendations from previous GAO reports regarding improving climate information sharing and incorporating climate resilience into design standards and building codes.\n\nThe report recommends that DOD:\n\n* Improve the integration of climate resilience considerations into its installation master planning processes.\n* Update its Unified Facilities Criteria to provide clearer guidance on incorporating climate projections into facilities designs.\n* Strengthen its collaboration with other federal agencies and organizations to access and utilize the best available climate information.\n\nThe report concludes that DOD needs to take more proactive steps to address the growing threat of climate change to its infrastructure. By incorporating climate resilience measures into its planning and project designs, DOD can better protect its assets, minimize future costs, and ensure the readiness of its installations. \n\n"}
{"id": "summarization_049", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nDuring a hearing of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on Wednesday, Rep Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) pressed Philip Duffy, president of Woods Hole Research Center, to identify reasons that sea levels might be rising. \n \n They are rising, without dispute, at an estimated rate of 3.3 millimeters a year. Much of that increase is attributed by scientists to melting surface ice. The planet loses tens of billions of tons of ice each year. Enough is lost from Antarctica alone to increase global sea levels by a millimeter every three years, but that figure isn’t steady. Sea level rise is occurring at an increasing rate. \n \n Brooks asked Duffy what else might be contributing to that rise. Duffy pointed to ground subsidence, which is the sinking of the ground in places that can exacerbate the problem of rising sea levels. Cities like New Orleans are sinking quickly, even faster in many places than the seas are rising. \n \n Brooks asked if any other factors were contributing to sea level rise. \n \n “Those are all that I know of,” Duffy replied. \n \n “What about erosion!” Brooks exclaimed. “Every single year that we’re on Earth, you have huge tons of silt deposited by the Mississippi River, by the Amazon River, by the Nile, by every major river system — and for that matter, creek, all the way down to the smallest systems. And every time you have that soil or rock whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise. Because now you’ve got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up.” \n \n “I’m pretty sure that’s …” Duffy tried to interject. \n \n “What about the white cliffs of Dover?” Brooks continued. “California, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines and time and time again you have the cliffs crash into the sea. All of that displaces the water which forces it to rise, does it not?” \n \n “I’m pretty sure that on human time scales,” Duffy replied, “those are minuscule effects.” \n \n Duffy is correct. \n \n Brooks has a vision in his head like the classic experiment by Archimedes, in which the scientist sank down into his bath and noticed the water overflow — providing a way to determine the volume of his body. But the amount of water displaced by even a giant boulder falling into the ocean is not like a body going into a bathtub. It is, as Duffy said, minuscule. \n \n Certainly 3.3 millimeters doesn’t sound like a lot of water to displace, and it does seem, to Brooks’s point, that it’s an amount — about 0.1 inch — that would be easy to displace with a cliff collapse near San Diego. The equivalent rise relative to surface area in an Olympic-sized swimming pool would be 0.0000000000114 millimeters. That’s not possible, though, since a water molecule isn’t that small. \n \n But when you apply 3.3 millimeters of rise to the entire ocean? We’re talking about a lot of water that’s displaced — 3.3 millimeters across about 362 million square kilometers of surface area. The total volume displaced, then, would be 1.19 trillion cubic meters of water. \n \n We know from Archimedes’ work that the amount of earth required to displace that much water is the same volume: 1.19 trillion cubic meters. Here’s a corny video by a science teacher showing how it works. \n \n So to make the oceans rise 3.3 millimeters, we would need to displace that 1.2 trillion cubic meters of water upward by dropping in 1.2 trillion cubic meters of dirt or stone or whatever. \n \n How much is that? It’s a sphere of earth a bit over 8 miles in diameter. If we were to balance it at the top of the Capitol building, it would look like this. \n \n If the sphere were stone, it would weigh about 6.6 quadrillion pounds. Just drop that in the ocean and — bloop! — 3.3 millimeters of sea-level increase. (We’re ignoring here that dropping it in some parts of the ocean would result in a mountain in that location. For the sake of explaining things, we’re pretending that the oceans are just one big uniform pool of water and that the sea level rise is similarly consistent. This isn’t how it works, of course.) \n \n Put another way, it’s a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States’ 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world’s oceans. That would push sea levels up by 3.3 millimeters. \n \n But, remember: That sea level rise happens annually. So every year, we’d need to take the top five inches of the United States, roll it in a ball and drop it in the ocean to get the sort of sea level rise we’re currently seeing. Don’t worry, though; assuming that the depth of Earth’s crust is about 40 kilometers in the United States, it would take 309,000 years for us to get to the mantle. \n \n Except, of course, that sea level rise is occurring at an increasing rate. If someone could check on the white cliffs of Dover for us, we’d appreciate it. ||||| Mo Brooks rejects notion that global warming is causing sea levels to increase, and says: ‘What about the White Cliffs of Dover?’ \n \n A member of Congress has suggested that the White Cliffs of Dover tumbling into the English Channel was causing rising sea levels. \n \n Everglades under threat as Florida's mangroves face death by rising sea level Read more \n \n Republican Mo Brooks of Alabama pushed back at the notion that rising sea levels were the result of global warming in a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology on Wednesday. \n \n Instead, Brooks pointed to silt deposition as well as erosion as a cause of rising sea levels. Questioning scientist Phil Duffy of the Woods Hole Research Center, Brooks postulated that silt and mud washed by rivers into the ocean caused water levels to rise as it settled on the sea floor. “Now you have got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up,” he said. \n \n He went on: “What about the White Cliffs of Dover … [and] California, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines, and time and time again you have the cliffs crashing into the sea? All of that displaces water which forces it to rise, does it not?” \n \n Duffy answered: “I’m pretty sure on human timescales, those are minuscule effects.” \n \n The questioning went on as Brooks argued the Antarctic ice sheet was actually growing. A recent study reported that the ice sheet had shrunk by 1,463km from 2010 to 2016. \n \n Duffy disagreed, noting that “we have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage”, citing “the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration” for his data. \n \n However, Brooks insisted: “Well, I’ve got a Nasa base in my district, and apparently, they’re telling you one thing and me a different thing.” \n \n Brooks said: “There are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.” \n \n Brooks, a graduate of Duke University and University of Alabama School of Law, was first elected to Congress in 2010 from his North Alabama district. In 2017, he mounted an unsuccessful bid for the US Senate vacated by attorney general Jeff Sessions. Brooks finished third in the Republican primary behind the eventual nominee Roy Moore as well as appointed incumbent Luther Strange. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded. \n \n Rating is available when the video has been rented. \n \n This feature is not available right now. Please try again later. ||||| North Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks is making headlines again for blaming sea level rise on rocks falling into the ocean and silt washing from major rivers. \n \n Brooks was one of several Republican lawmakers sparring with a climate scientist at a Wednesday hearing of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. \n \n Included in the arguing were Republicans Lamar Smith of Texas, the committee's chairman, and California's Dana Rohrabacher, but the websites for Science and Esquire used Brooks' picture to illustrate their coverage. \n \n \"Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise,\" read the Science site's headline. \n \n \"Is the Human Race Too Dumb to Survive on This Planet?\" asked Esquire also featuring Brooks. \n \n \"Here's how big a rock you'd have to drop into the ocean to see the rise in sea level happening now,\" chimed in the Washington Post. \n \n Brooks was quoted saying, \"Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up.\" He referred to erosion on the California coastline and England's White Cliffs of Dover and silt from the Mississippi and Nile rivers. \n \n Brooks also said Antarctic ice is growing, not shrinking, and that statement was challenged by Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Duffy cited NASA as one of his sources, and Brooks replied that, \"I've got a NASA base in my district and, apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing.\" \n \n Brooks at length \n \n Brooks spoke at greater length Thursday afternoon between votes on the House floor. \n \n \"You put it all together, erosion is the primary cause of sea level rise in the history of our planet,\" Brooks said, \"and these people who say to the contrary may know something about climate but they don't know squat about geology.\" \n \n \"Keep in mind I'm talking millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years, erosion is the primary cause of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of cubic miles of sea displacement that in turn forces the sea levels to rise,\" he said. \n \n \"But if you're talking a shorter historical time span,\" Brooks said, \"you're going to have great fluctuations up and down due to the quantities of ice that exist on a planet.\" In an ice age, sea levels drop significantly, he said. \n \n The oceans \"are always rising,\" Brooks said, except during times of ice buildup that offset erosion. Look at the \"huge alluvial planes that exist around the great rivers like the Mississippi, the Amazon, the Mekong, the Danube, the Yangtze and you'll see these huge alluvial planes made up entirely of erosion,\" he said. \n \n Brooks disagreed with Duffy during the hearing about whether Antarctic ice is growing or shrinking. Duffy said satellite records \"clearly\" show shrinkage and a speedup of that shrinkage. \n \n Brooks questioned Duffy's data, and Duffy said it came from the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\" That's when Brooks mentioned the NASA base in his district and said it was telling him something different. \n \n Wrong in the '60s \n \n \"You've got to make sure you're careful in terminology,\" Brooks said later Thursday. \"I'm talking ice quantity. He's talking about surface area. Two entirely different things.\" \n \n Brooks said the \"total ice quantity, which is what affects sea levels, has been increasing. The Antarctica sea ice varies from year to year and from decade to decade.\" The ice is growing in quantity on the interior of Antarctica, he said. \n \n \"I never said anything about Antarctic sea ice, but that's the comparison they make,\" Brooks said of the press. \"I'm talking about Antarctica ice, which is both the sea ice and the interior of Antarctica. And the interior is where the vast majority of ice is.\" \n \n \"I've never been skeptical of climate change,\" Brooks said. \"The climate is always changing. The planet is always either heating up or cooling down. It is very rarely constant.\" \n \n Brooks was asked about the theory that current warming is a threat and human activity is part of its cause. \"In the late '60s and early '70s, the climate scare was cooling, that we're going to enter into a new ice age...,\" Brooks said. \"They turned out to be wrong.\" \n \n \"What I'm trying to establish is that a lot of these climatologists have no idea what they're really talking about,\" Brooks said, \"and it's because we have not had a long enough period time with exact scientific measurement to know what the climate's going to be like 50 years from now or 100 years from now.\" \n \n Brooks said studies and projections made in the 1990s by \"these so-called climatologists\" were almost all wrong \"on the hot side as to where we would be in 2018.\" Over 90 percent were wrong, he said. \n \n The bottom line \n \n \"The bottom line is nobody is smart enough to know with the evidence we have and the relatively small time frame we have - 50 years in the history of the planet. That's just not enough information with which to make accurate predictions.\" \n \n So what is motivating scientists to say the Earth is dangerously warming? \n \n \"Money,\" Brooks said. \"Money to invest in a certain kind of resources where you might have a financial interest. There's also politics as you're trying to cobble together the votes to win an election, that's probably part of it, too.\" ||||| Washington (CNN) A member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology evinced skepticism about climate change during an exchange with a witness about rising sea levels. \n \n Instead, Alabama Republican Rep.

Dana Rohrabacher who said he was \"disturbed\" that he heard people warning against questioning the link between human activity and climate change. \n \n On Wednesday, at a hearing titled \"using technology to address climate change,\" Brooks began by raising a broad question about rising ocean levels to the witness panel. \n \n Philip Duffy, president of Woods Hole Research Center, said in response to the question that \"the last 100-year increase in sea-level rise, as I mentioned earlier, has clearly been attributed to human activities, greenhouse gas emissions.\" \n \n Brooks interjected and rephrased his question again, asking if there \"are other factors.\" \n \n \"What about erosion?\" Brooks offered during the exchange. He added: \"Every time you have that soil or rock, whatever it is, that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise because now you've got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up.\" \n \n Duffy responded that he did not believe that explained sea-level rise. \n \n \"I'm pretty sure that on human time scales those are minuscule effects,\" Duffy said. \n \n Brooks then moved to ice levels and asserted that Antarctic ice is growing, to which Duffy responded that satellite records have documented \"shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage.\" \n \n Brooks wrapped up his questioning by saying he had heard differently from NASA, and said there were \"plenty of studies\" showing an ice sheet increase in Antarctica. \n \n \"I've got a NASA base in my district,\" Brooks said. \"And apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing.\" \n \n A day after the hearing, the committee tweeted a link to an op-ed from The Wall Street Journal denying climate change caused sea-level rise. \n \n The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change \n \n https://t.co/5IohGvDCHW — Sci,Space,&Tech Cmte (@HouseScience) May 17, 2018 \n \n According to NASA, Antarctica's ice sheets have lost mass since 2002. \n \n The agency's site also said , \"Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms.\" \n \n Duffy, who worked on climate change policy in the Obama administration, told CNN on Thursday that while he had \"never heard that particular line\" on sea level rise before, he essentially had expected the tone of the hearing to feature climate change skepticism. \n \n \"None of that is new,\" Duffy said. \"They've been doing that forever.\" \n \n Duffy said he would have hoped a \"productive\" science committee would seek to formulate aggressive policy on climate change as well as expand the nation's scientific capabilities. \n \n And as for the question of sea level rise, Duffy said, \"It's really caused by climate change.\" \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_050", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nWhat Is Leveraged Lending?\nPut simply, leveraged lending refers to loans to companies that are highly indebted (in financial jargon, highly leveraged ). Conceptually, a leveraged loan is understood to be a relatively high-risk loan made to a corporate borrower, but there is no consensus definition of leveraged lending for measurement purposes. Instead, different observers or industry groups use various working definitions that may refer to the borrower's corporate credit rating or a ratio of the company's debt to some measure of its ability to repay that debt, such as earnings or net worth. Because they are high risk, leveraged loans typically have relatively high interest rates, and thus offer higher potential returns for lenders. \nWho Holds Leveraged Loans?\nInvestors can hold leveraged loans by either (1) investing directly in individual leveraged loans, typically through syndications and participations or (2) investing in CLOs. Institutions that directly hold large shares of outstanding leveraged loans include mutual funds (19%), banks (8%), and insurance companies (6%), as shown in Figure 2 . According to one study, mutual fund holdings are split fairly evenly between funds offered to institutional investors and funds offered to retail investors. Nearly all of the remainder of leveraged loans (62%) are held by CLOs. Portions, or tranches , of CLOs are then sold, largely to the same types of investors that invest directly in leveraged loans. CLOs will be discussed in more detail in the next section. As discussed above, banks' share of funding in the leveraged loan market has exhibited a long-term decline.\nWhat Are CLOs?\nCollateralized loan obligations are securities backed by portfolios of corporate loans. Although CLOs can be backed by a pool of any type of business loan, in practice, U.S. CLOs are primarily backed by leveraged loans, according to the Federal Reserve. The outstanding value of U.S. CLOs has grown from around $200 billion at year-end 2006 to $617 billion at year-end 2018. As noted above, about 60% of leveraged loans are held in CLOs.\nCLOs offer a way for investors to receive cash flows from many loans, instead of being completely exposed to potential payments or defaults on a single loan. To isolate financial risks, CLOs are structured as bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that are separate legal entities. Each CLO has a portfolio manager, who is responsible for constructing the initial portfolio as well as the CLO's ongoing trading activities. CLO managers are primarily banks, investment firms (including hedge funds), and private equity firms. \nCLOs are sold in separate tranches , which give the holder the right to the payment of cash flow on the underlying loans. The different tranches are assigned different payment priorities, so some will incur losses before others. This tranche structure redistributes the loan portfolios' credit risk. The tranches are often known as senior , mezzanine , and equity tranches, in order from highest to lowest payment priority, credit quality, and credit rating. Through this process, the loan portfolio's risks are redistributed to the lower tranches first, and tranches with higher credit ratings are formed. \nIn general, the financial industry views CLOs' tranched structure as an effective method for providing economic protection against unexpected losses. As Figure 3 illustrates, in the event of default, the lower CLO tranches would incur losses before others. Hence, tranches with higher payment priority have additional protection from losses and receive a higher credit rating. The pricing of the tranches also reflects this difference in asset quality and credit risk, with lower tranches offering potentially higher returns to compensate for greater risks taken. \nWho Holds CLOs?\nCLOs are often sold to institutional investors, including asset managers, banks, insurance companies, and others. The asset management industry, which includes hedge funds and mutual funds, mainly holds the riskier mezzanine and equity tranches, and banks and insurers hold most of the lower-risk senior CLO tranches. The Federal Reserve estimated that U.S. investors held approximately $556 billion in CLOs based on U.S. loans at the end of 2018. Of this, an estimated $147 billion in U.S. CLO holdings were issued domestically. Detailed data on domestic CLOs' holders are not available; certain detailed data, however, can be found in the reporting of cross-border financial holdings, which comprise a large majority of U.S. CLOs. The cross-border financial reporting indicates that $409 billion of U.S. CLO holdings were issued in the Cayman Islands, apparently the only offshore issuer. Figure 4 provides an overview by investor type for domestic holdings of these CLOs.\nCould Leveraged Loans Exacerbate an Economic Downturn?\nThe rapid growth of leveraged lending has led to concerns that this source of credit could dry up in the next downturn. A slowdown in leveraged loan issuance could pose challenges for the (primarily) nonfinancial companies relying on leveraged loans for financing. Were these firms to lose access to financing, they could be forced to reduce their capital spending, among other operational constraints, if they were unable to find alternative funding sources. Capital spending (physical investment) by businesses is typically one of the most cyclical components of the economy, meaning it is highly sensitive to expansions and recessions. Overall borrowing by nonfinancial firms is historically high at present. This raises concerns that heavily indebted firms could experience a debt overhang âwhere high levels of existing debt curtail a firm's ability to take on new debtâin the next downturn. If a debt overhang at nonfinancial firms leads to a larger-than-normal reduction in capital spending or more corporate failures, this might exacerbate the overall downturn.\nIf a downturn in the leveraged loan market had a negative effect on financial stability, as discussed in the next section, negative effects on the overall economy could be greater.\nWhat Are the Risks Associated with Leveraged Loans and CLOs?\nLeveraged loans and CLOs pose potential risks to investors and overall financial stability. Some risks, such as potential unexpected losses for investors, are presented by both leveraged loans and CLOs. Some apply to only one, such as risks posed by securitization presented by CLOs. This section considers the risks posed by both, highlighting differences between the two where applicable.\nRisks to investors. Like any financial instrument, leveraged loans and CLOs pose various types of risk to investors. In particular, they pose credit risk âthe risk that loans will not be repaid in full (due to default, for example). Credit risk is heightened because the borrowers are typically relatively indebted, have low credit ratings, and, in the case of covenant-lite loans, certain common risk-mitigating protections have been omitted. The ways borrowers often use the funds raised from leveraged loans, such as for leveraged buyouts, can also be high risk. Nevertheless, the overall risk of leveraged loans should not be exaggeratedâleveraged loans have historically had lower default rates and higher recovery rates in default than high-yield ( junk ) bonds, another form of debt issued by financially weaker firms. Credit risk is mitigated to a certain degree because leveraged loans are typically secured and their holders stand ahead of the firm's equity holders to be repaid in the event of bankruptcy. Furthermore, leveraged loans typically have floating interest rates, so interest rate risk is borne by the borrower, not the investor.\nAs mentioned in the \"What Are CLOs?\" section, when leveraged loans are securitized and packaged into CLOs, the credit risk of the original leveraged loans is redistributed by the CLOs' tranched structure, with senior tranches (mostly held by banks and insurers) often receiving the highest credit rating (e.g., AAA) and junior tranches (mostly held by hedge funds and other asset managers) receiving lower credit ratings. Subordinated debt and equity positions provide additional protection to the senior tranches. Tranching distributes CLO credit risk differently across investors in different tranches.\nUp to this point in the credit cycle, the risks associated with leveraged loans and CLOs have largely not materializedâleveraged loan default rates have been relatively low because of low interest rates and robust business conditions. But some analysts fear that default rates could spike if economic conditions worsen, interest rates rise, or bothâand these possibilities may not have been properly priced in. Default rates on leveraged loans rose from below 1% to almost 11% during the last recession. An unanticipated spike in default rates would impose unexpected losses on leveraged loan and CLO holders.\nSystemic risk. Investment losses associated with changing asset values, by themselves, are routine in financial markets across many types of assets and pose no particular policy concern if investors have the opportunity to make informed decisions. The main policy concern is whether leveraged loans and CLOs pose systemic risk ; that is, whether a deterioration in leveraged loans' performanceâparticularly if it were large and unexpectedâcould lead to broader financial instability. This depends on whether channels exist through which problems with leveraged loans could spill over to cause broader problems in financial markets. Losses on leveraged loans or liquidity problems with leveraged loans could lead to financial instability through various transmission channels discussed below.\nDuring the financial crisis, problems with mortgage-backed securities (MBS) demonstrated how a class of securities can pose systemic risk. Similar to CLOs, MBS are complex, opaque securities backed by a pool of underlying assets that are typically tranched, with the senior tranches receiving the highest credit rating. Unexpected declines in housing prices and increases in mortgage default rates revealed that MBSâboth highly rated and lowly rated tranchesâhad been mispriced, with the previous pricing not accurately reflecting the underlying risks. The subsequent repricing led to a cascade of systemic distress in the financial system: liquidity in the secondary market for MBS rapidly declined and fire sales pushed all MBS prices even lower. MBS losses caused certain leveraged and interconnected financial institutions, including banks, investment firms, and insurance companies, to experience capital shortfalls and lose access to the short-term borrowing markets on which they relied. Ultimately, these problems caused financial panic and a broader decline in credit availability as financial institutions deleveraged âreducing new lending activity to restore their capital levelsâin response to MBS losses. The resulting reduction in credit in turn caused a sharp decline in real economic activity. \nCLOs today share some similarities with MBS before the crisis, but there are important differences. Similarities include the rapid growth in available credit and erosion of underwriting standards. Both types of securities are relatively complex and opaque, potentially obfuscating the underlying assets' true risks. Outstanding leveraged loans and CLOs are small relative to overall securities markets, which in isolation is prima facie evidence that they pose limited systemic risk, even if they were to become illiquid or subject to fire sales. However, before the financial crisis, policy concerns were mainly focused on potential problems in subprime mortgage markets, which were also relatively small. Nevertheless, problems with subprime mortgages turned out to be the proverbial tip of the iceberg, as the deflating housing bubble caused losses in the much-larger overall mortgage market. Analogously, a disruption in the leveraged lending market could create spillover effects in related asset classes, similar to how problems that started with subprime mortgages eventually spread to the entire mortgage market and nonmortgage asset-backed securities in the financial crisis. Ultimately, the underlying cause of the MBS meltdown was the bursting of the housing bubble. Despite the high share of business debt to gross domestic product (GDP) at present, experts are divided on whether there is any underlying asset bubble in corporate debt markets (analogous to the housing bubble) that could lead to a destabilizing downturn. \nIn addition, it is not clear whether unexpected losses in leveraged lending would lead to broader systemic deleveraging by financial firms or problems for systemically important institutions. Losses on leveraged loans or CLOs might not cause problems for leveraged financial institutions, such as banks, because (1) their leveraged loan and CLO holdings are small relative to total assets and limited mostly to AAA tranches; and (2) banks face higher capital and liquidity requirements to protect against losses or a liquidity freeze, respectively, than they did before the crisis. Furthermore, the largest holders of leveraged loans and CLOs are asset managers. They generally hold these assets as agents on their clients' behalf and thus are normally not vulnerable to insolvency from asset losses because those losses are directly passed on to account holders, who own the assets. \nAnother source of systemic risk relates to a liquidity mismatch for certain holders. There is potentially an incentive for investors in leveraged loan mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs), respectively, to redeem their shares on demand for cash or sell their shares during episodes of market or systemic distress, similar to a bank run. Because the underlying leveraged loans and CLOs are illiquid, investors who are first to exit could limit their losses if they redeem them while the fund still has cash on hand and is not forced to sell the underlying assets at fire sale prices. This incentive could act as a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the incentive to run could cause mass redemptions that then force fire sales that reduce the fund's value. Leveraged loan mutual funds generally allow withdrawal on demand, but other run risk may be limited because \"U.S. CLOs are not required to mark-to-market their assets, and early redemption by investors is generally not permissible\" and other private investment funds, such as hedge funds, often feature redemption restrictions.\nAlthough the financial crisis is a cautionary tale, there are other historical examples where a sudden shift in an asset class's performance did not lead to financial instability. For example, a collapse in the junk bond market following a spike in defaults from 1989 to 1990 did not pose problems for the broader financial system or economy. In addition, while CLO issuance slowed during the last financial crisis, the rating agency and data provider Standard & Poor's reports that CLO default rates remained low and \"no tranches originally rated AAA or AA experienced a loss\" throughout the crisis. However, the amount of CLOs outstanding was much smaller then compared to now, and product features have changed over time. More recently, in December 2018, relatively large investor withdrawals from bank loan mutual funds did not result in instability in the leveraged loan market.\nHow Are Leveraged Loans Regulated?\nThe goals of financial regulation, and the tools used to achieve those goals, vary based on the type of financial institution, market, or instrument involved. Thus, to answer this question, it is useful to break down leveraged loan regulation by the type of institution and activity (issuance, investment, and securitization). \nLeveraged lending falls under the purview of multiple regulators with different regulatory approaches and authorities. This regulatory fragmentation could encourage activities to migrate to less-regulated sectors, limits the official data available, and may complicate the evaluation and mitigation of any potential systemic risk to financial stability associated with leveraged lending. \nFollowing the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an interagency council of regulators headed by the Treasury Secretary, was created to address threats to financial stability and issues where regulatory fragmentation hinders an effective policy response. In its 2018 Annual Report, FSOC recommended that the financial regulators \"continue to monitor levels of nonfinancial business leverage, trends in asset valuations, and potential implications for the entities they regulate.\" Outside of monitoring risk, FSOC has not, to date, recommended any regulatory or legislative changes to address leveraged lending.\nWhat Is the Status of the Bank Regulators' Leveraged Loan Guidance?\nBank regulators use guidance to provide clarity to banks on supervision, such as how supervisors treat specific activities in their exams. In 2013, the federal bank regulators jointly issued an updated 15-page guidance document that described their \"expectations for the sound risk management of leveraged lending activities.\" Subsequently, banks asserted that following the guidance constrained them from making sound loans and that regulators enforced the guidance as if it were a binding regulation. As opposed to guidance, a regulation can be issued only if the agency follows the Administrative Procedure Act's requirements (5 U.S.C. Â§551 et seq.), including the notice and comment process and other relevant requirements. Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA; P.L. 104-121 ), regulators must submit new regulations and certain guidance documents to Congress, which can then prevent a regulation or guidance from taking effect by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. Because the bank regulators appeared to have the view that the document did not meet the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" they did not submit it to Congress. \nIn 2017, Senator Pat Toomey asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to analyze the guidance and determine whether it qualified as a rule subject to CRA review. GAO concluded that the guidance is a rule subject to CRA review. Following GAO's determination, the bank regulators reportedly sent letters to Congress indicating they would seek further feedback on the guidance, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated at a hearing on February 27, 2018, that the Federal Reserve has emphasized to its bank supervisors that the guidance was nonbinding. The Comptroller of the Currency, Joseph Otting, reportedly stated in 2018 that the guidance provides flexibility for leveraged loans that do not meet its criteria, provided banks operate in a safe and sound manner. To date, no changes have been made to the guidance and no joint resolution of disapproval under the CRA has been introduced. The Congressional Research Service has been unable to locate a submission of the guidance to Congress following the GAO finding that it was required under the CRA.\nHow Has Congress Responded to Leveraged Lending?\nThe House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on June 4, 2019, entitled Emerging Threats to Stability: Considering the Systemic Risk of Leveraged Lending . Two unnumbered draft bills related to leveraged lending were considered at this hearing. The draft Leveraged Lending Data and Analysis Act would require the Office of Financial Research, a Treasury office that supports FSOC, to gather information, assess risks, and make recommendations in a report to Congress on leveraged lending. The draft Leveraged Lending Examination Enhancement Act would require the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), an interagency council of federal bank regulators, to set prudential standards for leveraged lending by depository institutions. It would also require the FFIEC to report quarterly on leveraged lending by depository institutions.\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

", "response": "\n\nLeveraged loans are loans given to companies with high debt levels. These loans are considered risky due to the borrowers' financial position and typically carry higher interest rates to compensate for that risk. Investors can hold leveraged loans directly or by investing in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). CLOs are securities backed by a pool of leveraged loans, which are then divided into tranches with varying risk profiles and credit ratings.\n\nThe rapid growth of leveraged lending has raised concerns about its potential impact on financial stability. A downturn in the leveraged loan market could negatively affect companies reliant on this financing, potentially leading to reduced investment and overall economic slowdown. While leveraged loans have historically performed well, some analysts worry about a potential spike in defaults during an economic downturn.\n\nCLOs, while providing diversification and mitigating risk through tranching, also pose potential systemic risks. Similar to the mortgage-backed securities during the 2008 financial crisis, CLOs are complex and opaque, potentially obscuring the true risks. While CLOs are currently smaller than the mortgage market was before the crisis, experts are unsure whether an underlying asset bubble exists in corporate debt markets that could trigger a destabilizing downturn.\n\nRegulating leveraged loans falls under various agencies with differing approaches.

Yeah .\nUser Interface: Children proof .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Ye ye yeah .\nUser Interface: Hmm .\nMarketing: So she likes uh buttons {vocalsound} which make click ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , pret\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so {vocalsound} it has to click .\nProject Manager: So they have to be waterproof maybe ?\nMarketing: It has to be uh wha {vocalsound} baby proof {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause they eat {disfmarker} she ate it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: yeah {vocalsound} but mainly it has to be very robust\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: because even if she's not very tall she's uh {vocalsound} high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ah .\nMarketing: So it has to be very robust .\nUser Interface: Okay , unbreakable .\nMarketing: Unbreakable , yeah .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: And uh {vocalsound} it has to be nice looking ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: colourful , maybe {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Colourful , yeah mm .\nUser Interface: Colourful ? That's not practical .\nMarketing: colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: No , that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it's always black or {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: , they're always black , yeah ,\nProject Manager: Mm mm-mm .\nUser Interface: No .\nMarketing: but this one could be I dunno , purple or b\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But how gonna {disfmarker} okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: No ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: because you think , why not .\nUser Interface: Otherwise you will never find it .\nMarketing: One colour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh\nMarketing: Oh like the phones ,\nIndustrial Designer: like the phones and these things we c yeah .\nMarketing: yeah , it could change colours , yeah .\nUser Interface: Cool .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: At least for children like one colour and {gap} . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ch\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Good idea .\nMarketing: Good .\nIndustrial Designer: And it should be really {gap} small and {gap} .\nProject Manager: Small also ? Don't you think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Huh not so big like {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: No uh , not too much buttons or {disfmarker} mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , not too much buttons and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator\nIndustrial Designer: Uh . Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} whatever {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I dunno if it's {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So colour , robustness , easy to use , size ,\nProject Manager: So , I think there's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: yeah , size matters , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Colour , {vocalsound} size , sh\nProject Manager: So you you think it's better if small than bigger .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: No , not too small , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like {gap} .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah , like a palm sized .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Just to hold it .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh maybe we can change the colours that {disfmarker} at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , at least the colour would be different .\nIndustrial Designer: you are to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame {gap} .\nMarketing: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're {disfmarker} they never find a good button in the right place .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow ,\nProject Manager: Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um {vocalsound} cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I dunno {gap} .\nUser Interface: No ,\nProject Manager: no .\nUser Interface: no screens , it's too complex .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Too expensive , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Too expensive for twelve Euro ?\nUser Interface: And n maybe not too expensive ,\nProject Manager: And too expensive .\nUser Interface: well it's not my problem , but well okay .\nMarketing: Ah .\nUser Interface: But no screens on remote controls .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen {vocalsound} which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right ,\nIndustrial Designer: Ye yeah .\nMarketing: so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: if you {disfmarker} if you like .\nIndustrial Designer: I mean it it's like\nMarketing: I don't know if it makes sense , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} it's like two types no ? {vocalsound} people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this\nMarketing: Yeah , for instance , mm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm .\nIndustrial Designer: or {disfmarker} so tha your switch on and off should be on\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: So adaptable {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah something {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Adaptable . Alright , good ,\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?\nIndustrial Designer: huh .\nUser Interface: On off ?\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .\nUser Interface: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a\nIndustrial Designer: Two .\nMarketing: Three buttons you mean ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} like three mental states ,\nProject Manager: Three option .\nUser Interface: yeah you know what I mean ,\nMarketing: Ah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: we can just make it uh\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um .\nUser Interface: controlled by a brain , huh ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: that ask you three {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} If it {disfmarker} if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .\nUser Interface: Sh sure , sure .\nMarketing: Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\nMarketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: You do this ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nMarketing: Uh no .\nUser Interface: I usually just change channels .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit .\nProject Manager: Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Dash .\nMarketing: And then back to the one I was before ,\nProject Manager: Also we can be here {disfmarker}\nMarketing: so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah you can\nProject Manager: yeah , that would be cool .\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Go back button is good .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries .\nUser Interface: I once had it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , the previous button is {gap} .\nProject Manager: Mm {vocalsound} yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo {vocalsound} previous of the previous . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh , okay . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: History . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Then you can watch what your {disfmarker} ah you could also record your {disfmarker} record your {vocalsound} sequence of actions ,\nIndustrial Designer: Uh .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} that becomes more complex ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remote controls .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , what the {disfmarker} which channels the viewer {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: maybe it's a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So I think we have full of idea .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm {vocalsound} work on these ideas and try to make a uh {vocalsound} the ones , {vocalsound} make um {disfmarker} to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . {vocalsound} And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do .

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nSenior staffers on the House Judiciary Committee helped Donald Trump's top aides draft the executive order curbing immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, but the Republican committee chairman and party leadership were not informed, according to multiple sources involved in the process. \n \n The news of their involvement helps unlock the mystery of whether the White House consulted Capitol Hill about the executive order, one of many questions raised in the days after it was unveiled on Friday. It confirms that the small group of staffers were among the only people on Capitol Hill who knew of the looming controversial policy. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Kathryn Rexrode, the House Judiciary Committee’s communications director, declined to comment about the aides’ work. A Judiciary Committee aide said Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) was not \"consulted by the administration on the executive order.\" \n \n \"Like other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law,\" a House Judiciary Committee aide said in a statement. \"However, the Trump Administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll-out and implementation.” \n \n The work of the committee aides began during the transition period after the election and before Donald Trump was sworn in. The staffers signed nondisclosure agreements, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Trump's transition operation forced its staff to sign these agreements, but it would be unusual to extend that requirement to congressional employees. Rexrode declined to comment on the nondisclosure pacts. \n \n It’s extremely rare for administration officials to circumvent Republican leadership and work directly with congressional committee aides. But the House Judiciary Committee has some of the most experienced staffers when it comes to immigration policy. \n \n \n \n \n \n GOP leaders received no advance warning or briefings from the White House or Judiciary staff on what the executive order would do or how it would be implemented — briefings they still had not received as of Sunday night. Leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) only saw the final language when reporters received it Friday night, according to multiple Hill sources. \n \n Rather, Republicans on the Hill spent the entire weekend scrambling to find out what was going on, who was involved and how it was that they were caught so flat-footed. \n \n \"Their coordination with the Hill was terrible,\" said one senior GOP source on the Hill, who seemed flabbergasted that congressional Republicans didn’t receive talking points from the White House on the executive order until late Saturday night, about 24 hours after President Donald Trump signed it. “We didn't see the final language until it was actually out.” \n \n The fumbled roll-out serves as a cautionary tale to Trump officials who decide to go it alone in enacting controversial policies without help from Congress. Indeed, the lack of consultation has set off a wave of resentment on Capitol Hill. GOP insiders believe that the White House and Goodlatte staffers could have avoided the drama that unfolded over the weekend had they looped in relevant lawmakers on the front end. \n \n The episode also has instilled a wariness among GOP aides about the White House. \n \n “These executive orders were very rushed and drafted by a very tight-knit group of individuals who did not run it by the people who have to execute the policy. And because that’s the case, they probably didn’t think of or care about how this would be executed in the real world,” said another congressional source familiar with the situation. “No one was given a heads-up and no one had a chance to weigh in on it.” \n \n Insiders told POLITICO that the botched roll-out of the immigration executive order was coordinated for the most part by White House policy director Stephen Miller, a former Sessions staffer, and Trump senior strategist Stephen Bannon. \n \n It was intentionally kept quiet. Even key administration officials had not seen it until \"just before it was going out,\" according to one White House source. \n \n A Judiciary Committee aide said Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) was not \"consulted by the administration on the executive order.\" | AP Photo \n \n Since the staffers did not inform Republican leaders about their work, Hill leaders and the House Homeland Security panels were never given the chance to vet the order for potential problems — such as the issue with green card holders that caused authorized U.S. immigrants to be threatened with deportation at airports. \n \n Even supporters of the administration believe the administration erred in its lack of communication. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, speculated that the administration could have given \"people a heads up a week or so out and get them on the same page.” But he cautioned that the administration is “understaffed and Trump is impatient,” and the White House has a natural learning curve. \n \n “They could have waited a couple days, and they would have done better,” Gingirich said. \"I think some of this stuff is they're learning how to roller skate. They can't understand in advance, they have to do it for the first time.” \n \n When the order first came down Friday, and reports of problems started to surface, lawmakers frantically called leadership offices and committees staff to ask how to respond. That’s when GOP leadership staffers moved to do damage control — even as the administration ignored their requests for briefings and more information. Frustrated by the administration’s lack of communication to reporters on what the executive order did and didn’t do, they tried to pick up the slack by emphasizing that the ban was not a prohibition on Muslims. \n \n “We were trying to clean up their damage,\" a senior Republican source said. \"The thing was getting totally mischaracterized. The way it was implemented was screwing over a lot of people.\" \n \n The White House has now dispatched aides to speak with Capitol Hill staffers before they make policy moves, a person familiar with the matter said. Boris Epshteyn, a senior aide, attended such a meeting Monday. \n \n Homeland Security Director John Kelly is expected to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday and has told others he was \"kept totally out of the loop,\" one person familiar with his comments said. \n \n Hill Republicans on Monday were privately simmering that administration officials didn’t seek out their expertise. Most Trump officials lack policy chops and Washington know-how, they argued, and Republicans said they could have been helpful. \n \n One senior GOP aide said that they generally understood Trump's goals to limit immigration, “but we're getting tired of all the chaos.” \n \n ||||| White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, left, speaks Saturday with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in the Oval office as President Trump speaks on the phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \n \n The fallout Monday from President Trump’s sweeping immigration order exposed painful rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet and fueled suspicions among his top advisers. \n \n That left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame — capped by Trump’s remarkable decision late Monday to fire the acting attorney general because she refused to enforce the order as potentially unlawful. \n \n For all the promises of Republican bonhomie, Trump and his aides kept GOP congressional leaders almost completely in the dark about the most consequential act of his young presidency: a temporary ban on refugees and on anyone from seven majority-Muslim nations. \n \n Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House, according to three people who have spoken with them. \n \n Inside the West Wing, tensions flared as differences in management style emerged between two factions: one led by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who wrote the immigration order, and the other composed of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and his deputies, who are accustomed to operating with a more traditional chain of command. \n \n (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \n \n Miller, 31, was the public face of the order and the populist wing of the White House over the weekend, directing department and agency chiefs as well as explaining and defending the move in television interviews. \n \n As it became evident that the rollout of the executive order bordered between clumsy and dysfunctional, people in Trump’s orbit divided over who was at fault, with some blaming Miller. Others said it was Priebus who should have taken charge of better coordinating with the departments and communicating with lawmakers and the public. \n \n “The problem they’ve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway,” said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump. \n \n [The first days inside Trump’s White House: Fury, tumult and a reboot] \n \n The infighting spilled into public view Monday morning on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Host Joe Scarborough, who spent part of Sunday visiting Trump at the White House, looked into the camera and directly challenged Miller. \n \n “This weekend was a disgrace and it’s all on your shoulders,” Scarborough intoned. \n \n His commentary was all but certain to be noticed by the president himself; Trump is such an avid watcher of the show that when Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) recently appeared, he received a congratulatory call from Trump just moments later. \n \n 1 of 23 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Protest at New York’s JFK airport against Trump’s order halting refu­gee admissions View Photos Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president, and some travelers were detained at U.S. airports.

Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n Scarborough’s monologue encapsulated many of the hallmarks of the new White House: It was direct, passionate and provocative, and it played out on live television. \n \n Scarborough’s analysis aligned with a faction of the West Wing that has grown concerned about the ascent of Miller and Bannon, close partners in driving Trump to make good on his most populist and nationalistic campaign promises, however incendiary. \n \n One area of heated debate is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants legal protection to undocumented immigrants who are brought to the United States as children — commonly known as “dreamers.” Hard-line conservatives have been urging Trump to rescind DACA, while other advisers, including Gingrich, are counseling him to keep it in place and avoid a politically treacherous confrontation, according to people involved in the deliberations. \n \n “Why pick a fight over this group of people who have a lot of emotional stories to tell? It’s not realistic. It’s not practical,” Gingrich said. “I strongly agree with the general direction we’re going, but I think this particular fight doesn’t emotionally make any sense.” \n \n In many ways, Trump’s leading advisers are simply operating within the power parameters the president established. Some officials — Bannon and Miller chief among them — are actively shaping policy and guiding the president’s decisions. Others — such as Priebus, the deputy chiefs of staff and White House press secretary Sean Spicer — function in a more reactive capacity, left trying to find order in chaos and explain away slapdash actions. \n \n The Priebus-Bannon relationship has had its warm moments. When Priebus’s wife was recently baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, Bannon attended the reception. \n \n The competing power dynamic appears to have made Priebus, in particular, suspicious of his colleagues’ motives, especially as Bannon asserts his influence, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. \n \n “A little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing,” one White House official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Priebus. “We have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because he’s seeing shadows where there are no shadows.” \n \n During the transition phase, for instance, Priebus maneuvered to sideline perceived threats. He suggested that Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent New York financier who is close to Trump and Bannon, serve outside the administration, as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to two people aware of the discussions. \n \n But Scaramucci demurred, opting for a senior White House job directing the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, a similar role to the one played by Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House. \n \n White House officials reject the notion that chaos has overshadowed the early days of Trump’s presidency. They say the media refuse to acknowledge his achievements and intentionally tried to stoke public dissent, even hysteria, with reports about the immigration order. \n \n “While false narratives circulate, the White House staff is busy working, together, to implement President Trump’s agenda for the betterment of our country,” said a White House spokesman who was not authorized to speak on the record. \n \n Trump fired off angry tweets attacking the media and lawmakers who criticized his ban, from mocking Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for his “tears” to labeling Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) “sadly weak.” \n \n Late Monday evening, Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates, who had instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend Trump’s immigration order. The White House said in a statement that Yates had “betrayed” the Justice Department and called her “very weak on illegal immigration.” \n \n Privately, the president seethed, venting about what he saw as unfair news coverage on a second straight weekend of mass protests, and quizzing confidants about their impressions of how his senior staffers were performing. \n \n [Donald Trump waits in his tower — accessible, yet isolated] \n \n As the controversy swirled, Trump, who has taken to giving visitors mini-tours of his new residence, found comfort in a trio of loyalists who share a room just steps from the Oval Office — Hope Hicks, the spokeswoman who has been at Trump’s side since before his campaign launch; Johnny McEntee, a former college football quarterback who is now the president’s personal aide; and Keith Schiller, a retired New York police officer and head of Trump’s personal security detail who now directs Oval Office operations. \n \n Nonetheless, some of Trump’s friends as well as his critics fear that his agenda may be compromised by mismanagement. \n \n “Frankly, when I look at this, I think he was ill-served by his staff,” said Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of Trump’s primary rivals. “If I were the president, I’d be very upset with the staff — that they didn’t say, ‘Hey, wait, hold on a second.’ Because that’s what executives do. They have people around them that help them to understand, ‘Hey, your message is fine but here is what’s going to come from it.’ ” \n \n On Capitol Hill, many Republicans close to leadership were frustrated that they received little to no guidance, or advance notice, about Trump’s immigration and refu­gee directive. One top House office said it was able to glean the president’s plan only through unofficial back channels to the Department of Homeland Security. \n \n Asked if he was consulted in drafting the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) replied simply, “I wasn’t” — an echo of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who told reporters Monday that the White House had not briefed him before signing the order. \n \n The first substantive guidance to congressional Republicans came late Saturday — well after protesters had descended on the nation’s airports — in a two-page memo that offered some details on the policy but, to the chagrin of several Capitol Hill aides, very little political guidance. At the end was a pledge for the secretary of state to report regularly on “victims of female genital mutilation or honor killing by foreign-born nationals.” \n \n It was not only Trump’s immigration order that rankled official Washington. His presidential memorandum that restructured the National Security Council to elevate Bannon to a seat on the Principals Committee, alongside the secretaries of state and defense, worried many in the national security community. Also concerning was language suggesting that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff could only attend certain Principals Committee meetings. \n \n But Spicer told reporters Monday that Trump was revising the directive to also include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. And he insisted that the DNI and Joint Chiefs chairman would be included in any Principals Committee meeting they wish to attend. \n \n The confusion out of the White House about the president’s intentions left some of the government’s most decorated officials scrambling to assert their relevance. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs, took the unusual step of issuing a statement to emphasize that he will “fully participate” in giving the president military advice. \n \n “I remain honored and humbled to represent the extraordinary men and women of the Joint Force in serving the president and our nation,” Dunford wrote. \n \n Karen DeYoung, Kelsey Snell and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON — Senior Republican lawmakers who work on national security issues, including the entire members of both Homeland Security committees, were not informed of \"red flag\" changes made to a draft of Donald Trump's recent controversial executive order on immigration until hours after the president signed it, sources says. \n \n \n \n This version of Friday's events appears to contradict, at least partially, what the White House has said about congressional involvement in drafting and reviewing the executive order before it was signed. A senior administration official initially said over the weekend that \"top immigration experts on Capitol Hill\" drafted the executive action. \"Republicans on Capitol Hill wrote it,\" the official told pool reporters on Sunday. \n \n White House spokesperson Sean Spicer doubled down on congressional involvement during a press briefing on Monday. Asked about Capitol Hill staff who say they weren't briefed on the executive order, Spicer turned the question back on reporters: \"535 offices, plus territories, you talked to them all?\" \n \n \"As was told to you last night, there were staff from appropriate committees and leadership offices that were involved,\" Spicer said. \n \n However, many Republican and Democratic members were not briefed on the final version of the executive order before Trump signed it on Friday, including the entire House Homeland Security committee and at least some members of the Senate Homeland Security committee. \n \n \"The House Homeland Security committee was not consulted on the final draft of the executive order,\" said a GOP aide. \n \n \n \n And while some Republican members have said that the order is similar to legislation passed by the House last year after the Paris attacks, it includes new language on current US green card and visa holders that shocked many members of Congress. \n \n \"Total BS,\" a senior Republican aide familiar with the matter said in response to Spicer's assertion Monday that the \"appropriate committees\" were briefed on the order. \"We got an eleventh-hour phone call the day of to let us know it was about to happen. Precisely zero formal consultation before that, just like [the Department of Homeland Security] itself.\" \n \n \n \n Sen. Rob Portman, a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, criticized the lack of scrutiny given to the order before it was signed, saying on CNN this weekend that \"an extreme vetting program that wasn't properly vetted.\" His spokesman Kevin Smith told BuzzFeed News in an email Monday that \"Senator Portman and his staff were not consulted about the EO in advance of its rollout.\" \n \n Similarly, Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was not consulted or briefed on the order, an aide confirmed on Monday. \"I think they understand that this was not handled in the most productive manner,\" Corker told Bloomberg. \n \n The senior Republican aide familiar with the matter said that while some lawmakers had seen an early draft of the order, they were blindsided by the contents of the final version and did not see it until it was made public Friday night. \n \n \"Friday we were operating under the assumption that the draft executive order that had circulated earlier in the week was going to reflect the final version,\" the source said. \"There didn't appear to be too many issues.\" \n \n But \"it was hours\" before members and staff saw the final version of the executive action signed Friday by Trump \"because coordination was so poor,\" the aide added. \n \n \"By the time we digested the changes and reviewed the final order, it was clear there were serious shortcomings and problems,\" the source said. \n \n One of the problems for some Republican members is the fact that the ban was being used to halt people with valid US visas and green cards at US airports over the weekend, instead of just temporarily stopping the issuance of new visas, which the source called a \"major red flag.\" \n \n \"It was chaotic and very uncoordinated and it caused not only a lot of concern and problems on Capitol Hill, it caused obviously a big PR backlash for the administration,\" the first Republican aide said. \"They seemed to sit and watch for about 48 hours before they decided to come out\" and clarify that green card holders and permanent residents weren't included in the ban. \n \n \"It was a total cluster [...] It was a complete cluster and the organization and the coordination really needs to improve dramatically and quickly,\" the aide added. \n \n Democrats on the two Homeland Security committees were apparently not briefed on the executive order either, two Democratic sources said. One Senate Democratic office said they were given a draft of the order early on by an \"advocacy group,\" which the aide declined to identify, but noted, as Republicans did, that the draft they saw was significantly different from what Trump signed. It's unclear if the draft viewed by Democrats was the same one that Republicans viewed. \n \n “We got no notice. We got no briefing, we got nothing from the administration,\" the Democratic aide said. \n \n The executive order that Trump signed Friday halted travel to the US for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen. It also suspended the US refugee program for four months and indefinitely halted the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the US. \n \n After the executive order was signed, border agents detained more than 100 people — including US green card holders and small children — at airports across the US, prompting protests in more than a dozen major cities. \n \n \n \n Republicans on Capitol Hill began publicly criticizing Trump's executive order as public outcry amplified throughout the weekend. On Sunday evening, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul issued a statement saying \"it is clear adjustments are needed\" after telling cable news channels on Friday that Trump's executive orders made it \"a safer day for America.\" \n \n \"In the future, such policy changes should be better coordinated with the agencies implementing them and with Congress to ensure we get it right—and don’t undermine our nation’s credibility while trying to restore it,” McCaul said in the Sunday statement. \n \n The New York Times reported that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was only briefed on the executive order as Trump signed it. \n \n The White House has continued to defend the ban, claiming it will protect the country against terrorists, despite global confusion about how it should be interpreted and court orders seeking to overturn it. Trump tweeted on Saturday that the US \"needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.\" \n \n Countries whose dual citizens would be affected were left scrambling over the weekend as well. In Canada, for instance — where at least 35,000 people share nationality with one of the seven banned countries — the prime minister's national security advisor said first learned of Trump's executive order in the media. \n \n Sarah Mimms contributed to this report. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Provide a long summary to contain all the needed information.", "response": "\n\nPresident Trump's executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries sparked controversy and confusion, particularly due to a lack of consultation with Republican leaders and congressional committees. Despite White House claims that \"top immigration experts on Capitol Hill\" drafted the order, senior Republican lawmakers on national security committees, including the entire House Homeland Security Committee, were not informed of the final version until after it was signed. \n\nThis lack of communication led to significant issues. The order, which halted travel for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen, and suspended the U.S. refugee program, resulted in the detention of over 100 people at airports across the US, including green card holders and children. This caused widespread protests and criticism, prompting even Republican lawmakers like House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul to call for \"adjustments\" and better coordination in the future.\n\nThe article highlights the role of senior staffers on the House Judiciary Committee in drafting the order during the transition period, a process shrouded in secrecy and done without the knowledge of Republican leadership.  Even key administration officials were not aware of the order's final content until right before it was issued. This led to confusion and frustration among lawmakers, who were forced to scramble to find out what was happening and respond to the public outcry.\n\nThe article also details the strained relationship between White House staffers, particularly between Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon and policy adviser Stephen Miller, who were heavily involved in crafting the order, and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and his deputies. This internal tension further contributed to the disarray surrounding the rollout of the executive order.\n\nThe article cites unnamed sources familiar with the situation who express concern about the lack of expertise and Washington know-how among Trump's advisors. These sources also point to the chaotic and uncoordinated nature of the rollout, describing it as a \"cluster\" and emphasizing the need for significant improvement.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting the global repercussions of the order, noting that countries like Canada were left scrambling to understand its implications. It underscores the significant damage done to U.S. credibility and the need\nfor a more transparent and collaborative approach to policymaking in the future.\n\nKey quotes include:\n\n* **Rep. Michael McCaul, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman:** \"In the future, such policy changes should be better coordinated with the agencies implementing them and with Congress to ensure we get it right—and don’t undermine our nation’s credibility while trying to restore it.\"\n* **Anonymous Republican aide:** \"Friday we were operating under the assumption that the draft executive order that had circulated earlier in the week was going to reflect the final version. There didn't appear to be too many issues.\"\n\nThe article paints a picture of a White House struggling to find its footing, characterized by internal divisions, a lack of transparency, and a disregard for the established norms of Washington policymaking. The controversy surrounding the immigration order serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of enacting sweeping changes without proper consultation and consideration.\n\n\n"}

Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh {vocalsound} just as vital to this project\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: um {vocalsound} I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um {disfmarker} designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . {vocalsound} What's uh {disfmarker} the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh {vocalsound} everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um {gap} everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh {disfmarker} uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you {disfmarker} you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew .\nMarketing: Oh my name's Andrew I'm a {disfmarker} I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to {gap} like {disfmarker} and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .\nProject Manager: Right {vocalsound} Kendra .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um {vocalsound} I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be {vocalsound} working on the design .\nProject Manager: Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so .\nUser Interface: Right . Yep , I'm just open to being creative .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh I'm Katie ,\nProject Manager: Yep , good .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , very very quickly , um {vocalsound} this {disfmarker} I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . Everybody says what they {gap} what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and think oh yes that's {disfmarker} it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that {disfmarker} I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh {vocalsound} let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um {disfmarker} In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um So I I {disfmarker} everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal .\nMarketing: Um , badger . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm and why ?\nMarketing: Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black {vocalsound} and white and uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: I feel they're {gap} underdog kind of status\nProject Manager: Oh right\nMarketing: and they're , the\nProject Manager: uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um probably a duck\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Kendra .\nUser Interface: I just {disfmarker} I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . Right , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh 's horses , no particular reason why {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , {gap} fair enough yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: because of their {disfmarker} their uh overall ability to uh uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Sorry ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: to make T_V_ remotes {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: Indeed absolutely yes ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: tha that's um {disfmarker} Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh {disfmarker} we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . {vocalsound} It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . Um , okay , um {vocalsound} would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls .\nUser Interface: Well I think {disfmarker} I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . Um , but that {disfmarker} it's easy to {gap} if you can switch back and forth instead of having to {vocalsound} press a bunch of different buttons\nProject Manager: No .\nUser Interface: and {disfmarker} so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know .\nProject Manager: Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's important that you should be able to {disfmarker} when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it {disfmarker} the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and {gap} T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Like it's very {disfmarker} a very {disfmarker} like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like {disfmarker} Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .\nProject Manager: Um what so wh what's in in {disfmarker} what particular style features are you thinking about ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Um . Something that looks looks {disfmarker} doesn't look like remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So if you want , {vocalsound} something that looks like uh {disfmarker} something that makes you think oh what's this ? Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen ,\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: but it makes you think oh .\nProject Manager: {gap} . Yeah\nMarketing: So , sorry that's a bit vague {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , {vocalsound} people won't see it as a remote control um and uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a {disfmarker} of remote controls ?\nUser Interface: I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better .\nProject Manager: I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: some from personal experience which look nice\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: but {vocalsound} aren't particularly comfortable . Um {vocalsound} any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Well from the mouse idea you could , {gap} remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want {gap} {disfmarker} could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button .\nProject Manager: Yes , I mean {vocalsound} the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: I suppose .\nProject Manager: fi find the button buttons easily .\nMarketing: Easily , yeah yeah .\nUser Interface: But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them {disfmarker} be kind of down so you could feel them\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: better .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh {disfmarker} certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh {disfmarker} I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah .\nProject Manager: Do we do we want uh {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm that would be good .\nUser Interface: Like a like a mobile phone ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Mm , yeah that would be good .\nProject Manager: Okay . So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um {disfmarker} the planet with ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm , um {vocalsound} especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but uh {disfmarker} I think if w if we market it as as not as not {disfmarker} well this {disfmarker} you c you could either market it as the point of view {disfmarker} we could have the two {disfmarker} we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and like you just {disfmarker} it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: but that might {disfmarker} considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so {disfmarker} make it practical at the same time . I think it's {disfmarker} this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: uh but also a device that uh is practically sound .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay , yeah , yeah , well\nMarketing: So um , I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . If you {gap} .\nProject Manager: I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim {disfmarker} need to aim for for all of . Um okay well\nMarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: first thoughts on um the the industrial design side .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh I think it's it's {disfmarker} remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's {disfmarker} you depend on them so much , but you don't {disfmarker} i i it's {disfmarker} you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna {disfmarker} something's gonna get messed up eventually . They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's {gap} {disfmarker} God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Indeed .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: it just {disfmarker} it needs to be very effective , very {disfmarker} always dependable . Uh I don't think we should make it too small I {disfmarker} 'cause I think it needs to {gap} it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But {disfmarker} so yes dependable , and have a {gap} good medium range size .\nProject Manager: Okay , and um colours , materials ? Kendra , anyone ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Well , most {disfmarker} I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nUser Interface: so maybe we should go with something different or be able to {disfmarker} I was just thinking of um {vocalsound} what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um {disfmarker} what are they called ? Like the face-plates\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm , mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: that you change so we could have maybe {disfmarker} I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nUser Interface: so people can get different different things . Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that ,\nProject Manager: Right .\nUser Interface: probably just plastic because that's always the lightest .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay that's uh {disfmarker} Again I don't think that's ever been done before ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it's uh the sort of {gap} the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh might need so . Uh Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ?\nMarketing: Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with {disfmarker} like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh {vocalsound} maybe thinking of that , it's {disfmarker} considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing {disfmarker} like a second campaign to market new facials for your {disfmarker} to your {disfmarker} might go a bit astray\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Unless you were trying to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I think {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control\nMarketing: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh\nIndustrial Designer: and sorta stagger the release of them\nMarketing: it's {disfmarker} that's a that's a good idea .\nIndustrial Designer: and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Right , okay\nMarketing: Yeah true .\nProject Manager: I think we've got um a good idea now . We uh {disfmarker} meeting is uh {disfmarker} Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . Uh thank you very much indeed .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} . \n[Text End]\n[Requirements]:\n1. Capture the key topics discussed.\n2.

{"id": "summarization_055", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \n You will never be able to attract the girl if you are unable to talk to her. Nearly all men have an irrational fear of approaching females, you are not alone. The good news is that it can be controlled quite simply!\n\n\nThis is the most simple step. Despite the fear that you may have, know that approaching is the easiest part.\n\n,\n\n\nWhat is Attraction Material? Attraction material is primarily banter and teasing so asking what they do or where they are from doesn't fall into this category. Most of it does not and should not mean anything. Think of it as conversation content which has little meaning other than to create amusement for you. In others words random nonsense coupled with some statements.\n\n, There is a caveat, attraction material should have a hint of sexuality, otherwise you become the dancing monkey... With the added sexual element it becomes flirting. Nice guys are just... nice. Sleazy guys are... disgusting. What do they have in common? They both feel ashamed of or as though it's wrong to demonstrate their sexuality and desires. The nice guy pretends it is not there while the sleazy guy acts on it anyway, but in a way that attempts to hide embarrassment or in a way that allows them plausible deniability when called out on it. Picture the sleaze whistling or grabbing ass in a way that if (when!) he gets blown out he still gets to high five his mates. Conveying strong masculinity and ownership of your sexuality is essential, as well as being more emotive. Being around you should have that little hint of risk and intrigue. You should spike the conversation with sexual innuendo, but it is much more than that. It is proximity, body language that dominates space, kino (touch) that shows you are comfortable with your own sexuality as well as taking the lead. It is being calm and collected in a charged moment tingling with tension and occasionally spiking the interaction with some very dominant kino.\n\n, It is not the material itself that is attractive to women. Instead, it is what the material sub communicates about you that women find attractive. When you are comfortable enough around females to banter, tease and throw out statements (cold reads) you're sub communicating a number of things:\n\n\nWhilst you may want her, you certainly do not need her. Neediness in any form is kryptonite. When you are being try hard with a girl, asking her questions and hanging off her answers (Wow, you come from London, that is so cool!!), or even just trying to build rapport suggests way too much interest for someone you know nothing about. Attraction material allows you the pretense of not being that bothered about her.\nYou do not know her yet and as such you are not THAT interested in her. Unless she just blew you away with some serious eye from across the room, in which case create a bubble around the two of you, own the space and her and assume familiarity and that the sex (which will be mind blowing) is so obviously going to happen it does not need mentioning. For every other occasion be the high value guy who has a bunch of attractive options. In other words, her looks got her a foot in the door but what else has she got because that is not enough. So spike her emotions positively and negatively. It is having a healthy amount of disinterest, or not always allowing her to hold your entire attention. Which of the two depends on how much you want to spike and how far along in the interaction you are in terms of her investment.\nYou are confident. If you are confident around her than you must be used to talking to girls, therefore you have a lot of beautiful women in your life. This is called being pre-selected and it tells her that you are safe to be around, not likely to be needy, fun to be with and a high value male. In other words you're the kind of guy girls want to get with.\nYou have real (inner) strength. In talking in a way that serves as self amusement (bantering and having fun), you convey that you don't need the validation or approval of others to feel good about yourself. You're content being you and you're not trying hard to please others for the purpose of having them like you. Having that kind of inner strength, knowing who you are and not allowing others to put you in a box and say \"no, this is who you are\" with their opinions of you, that is the foundation of attraction and it's what makes you great. If you have that true inner strength, you know who you are, you know what you want, you have a healthy sense of entitlement, and you're unaffected by the opinions of those around you (you don't need their approval to feel good about yourself is a part of this) then you are probably very successful in other areas of life. You're likely to be very well socially adjusted, popular, charismatic, a leader of others, stands for what he believes in, someone who takes risks and reaps the rewards, who has a story to tell, and blazes his own trail. The list goes on, the point being all of those qualities are what women are attracted to. Being able to convey those, well the outcome goes without saying.\nYou are not afraid to be silly. This ties into the above in that it shows that you do not take life too seriously, you are not wound tight so you most likely find that success comes easy, and the trials and tribulations that make life worth living don't faze you. It also suggests that if she were to be around you, she would have a great time.\n\n,;\n, It can be really tough getting out of one frame of mind and into another, especially if you work in a stuffy environment. The easiest way is to pretend you own the venue and act accordingly. This allows you to get comfortable in your surroundings. So walk around short setting, open, bounce, open, bounce. Ask people if they are having a good time, how they are doing, etc. Or it can be as simple as walking through a really crowded venue clinking glasses with everyone and saying hi. Just get the conversational juices flowing and start having fun interacting with people. Look to increase the length and playfulness of the interactions as you go along. It's very easy to then go back and re-open girls or to find yourself in set without planning it. Now for some more specific aspects:\n\n\nTransitions (moving from one topic to another). Another area a lot of guys seem to struggle with. This can seem tricky but it's something you already do with everyone in your life and in almost every normal conversation you have without realizing it.\n\nConversations do not have to follow a logical path, they often go off on tangents or jump to new topics that have nothing to do with anything you were previously talking about so do not worry too much about finding ways to link conversations together. Learn a few transitions from here or the routines manual and use them. Once you find yourself getting more into the conversation you will stop needing them. Just throw stuff out there that has nothing to do with what either of you are talking about and watch how quickly the randomness is forgotten.\n\n\nTeasing. This is one of those things that a lot of guys struggle with and often think that they just cannot do it. The best way to learn if you don't already know is to write out sentences girls might say and find the words in it that you can ping off, or trigger words.\n\nFind ways to tease effectively off of them and spend some time every week just practicing doing it. Do it on your phone when you are sat with nothing else to do. When you're infield (in a club, bar, street, etc) try to find not only her words but also situational cues or observations you can tease and banter off. What she's wearing, her drink, etc.\nRemember that teasing should be done in playful manner. It should not come off as mean spirited or as an insult.\n\n\nRoutines and cold reads. Many men are afraid of \"running out of things to say\". The biggest fear is that the dreaded awkward silence will inevitably creep in. To avoid this, you should memorize and practice a couple of stock routines and transitions as a fall back option.\n\nThe great thing about cold reads and routines is that they allow you to fill the awkward silence with the kind of things that you are maybe used to doing but in a way that generates intrigue based attraction. So saying \"you look like a stripper or an accountant, I can't tell which\" is akin to asking \"So what do you do for a living?\". Practice reframing questions as statements and use the attraction forums and Love Systems routines manuals to find some great examples of both cold reads and routines. Some more specific examples will be included in a bonus section at the end of this wiki.\n\n\nFalse Disqualifiers: Statement that display a healthy level of disinterest, while also acting as a way to convey interest in a flirtatious way. For example, \"I can already tell you and I aren't going to get along\" or \"If you weren't so dorky I'd probably be trying to get into your pants right now, shame you're a nerd\".\n\n, It can either reinforce the calm, cool, collected, fun loving, etc persona that you are attempting to portray, or betray you and expose it as an act.\n\n\nKeep your back straight, shoulders back, chin up, even leaning back slightly and with a smile on your face or a shit eating grin as though you know something they do not. Own your space and be aware of your presence, which should be bold and large.\n\nTo understand what it looks like, try to imagine you have a piece of string attached to your head and you are dangling from it, your spine is as straight as it can be in this situation, that is how you should be.\n\n\nWhen you are walking down the street in your day to day life, keep your head up. You will notice how uncomfortable it feels and how you have to fight the desire to look down or away. Don't! Stay strong and witness the outcome. Keep a smile on your face and maintain eye contact, girls will smile back, guys will look away or nod nervously. In the eyes of strangers you must be very high value to have that confidence.\nWhen seated take up space, relax, and try to be as horizontal as possible without it seeming weird. Be James Dean.\nMovement should be slow and deliberate, never fidgety or erratic. Imagine you are shoulder deep in water, now walk.\nNever face the girl completely until she is facing you. This can telegraph significant interest. Only give her your full bodily attention when it's on. Like all things game, play with this until it feels comfortable, and study your friends and others as they interact with each other. Watch how one person will be trying for the attention of the other. Two people talking will rarely have both parties facing each other directly. Don't be the one trying for the attention.\nLock in or lean on something to make yourself comfortable. For most guys (you included) locking is important and you should do it as soon as you can. If that means moving people around then just do it, remember bullshit baffles brains so keep talking random banter while you move them.\n\nAs a concept it doesn't seem to feed into the progression model as you cannot be dominant, Kino escalate or create a bubble around the two of you with proximity and vibe whilst trying to look cool leaning against a wall. These things should occur in spikes only. Whenever you are talking normally try to find something to lean against.\n\n\nUse takeaways to show some disinterest. A takeaway simply means taking away your attention, or interest, in order to spike her emotions. You can do this in a number of ways that starts with very subtle glances down at your finger nails or at your cigarette as she is talking. There are more medium plays such as getting your phone out to read a text quickly. Very blatant takeaways include turn your back when she says something stupid or that you fake disapproval of. What you are doing is giving her the gift of missing you and spiking that emotion that makes her want to cling on to you and keep you around.\n\nSome other takeaways are crossing your arms, looking over her shoulder, re-organizing something at the table (not fidgeting), etc.\n\n\nKino (touching). The topic of Kino is very extensive and covered elsewhere so this will be brief. When you begin, you should push yourself faster than you think is possible. Go way beyond what you think the girl will positively respond to and be completely unashamed doing so. No, this does not mean you should be foundling her breasts or pinching her ass while introducing yourself.\n\nTake her hand, lead her around with confidence and she will follow. Gently rub your hand down her forearm and hook her hand with two fingers whilst talking. Hold it like that for a few seconds then let go.\nPut your hand on the back of her shoulder and lean in to talk into her opposite ear, whilst applying gentle pressure to the shoulder to make her feel as though you are bringing her to you (done when very close already). The next time you do the above, put your hand with your thumb touching her neck.\nPut a hand on her hip whilst talking to her.\nMove her around, literally. Move her body with your hands. Make her stand to one side, push her up against a wall or the bar (covered below in Dominance).\nWhen talking into her ear, after the 2nd or 3rd time, gently caress the hair from her ear and hold her head that way.\nBump heads gently as you come away from her ear.\nStand really close (covered below in Proximity)\n\n\nProximity: You do this when the girl shows you some signs that she is attracted to you, which can happen instantly if you approach positively. It can help to create the kind of chemistry most interactions are lacking. For example, step in close, deep into her personal space and create a sense of excitement by not saying anything. Look her in the eye, look away over their shoulder than return to the eyes. This kind of tension creates huge amounts of attraction but only works when you have some to begin with. Otherwise it's just creepy. Using Proximity when you don't have a lot of attraction is still important, though you should temper it with less risky or tense conversation, and do it in mini spikes.\n\nFinal note on proximity. It is when you are up close, right in her space with very little room for her to move. A lot of guys make the mistake of thinking standing close is proximity; it is not in a bar or club setting, that is just standing. With proximity it is feeling each others presence on a different level.\n\n\nDominance: By setting the frame early that it is you in charge, you demonstrate confidence. The kind of dominance you use in the beginning is to not ask but rather state things you are going to do. So \"do you want to go to the bar?\" becomes \"come on, we're going to the bar to pound shots\". You then take her hand and lead her and you do so without hesitation. It also means taking her hand when you want, being a little forceful in moving her around (a little, not shoving but allowing her to feel the pressure) and being comfortable making demands. Again with this it requires calibration. It is not you ordering her like a drill sergeant but rather taking her in a loving way, you are making the decisions and carrying that burden.\n\nBeing congruent with taking a dominant role requires that you have rock solid confidence or can at least project that. So avoid darting eyes and any kind of fidgety behavior.\nFinal note on dominance; it should run through the whole interaction with you taking the lead but very physical dominance should come in spikes.\n\n\n\n, They do, they just do not verbalize it the way that men do, or make it so obvious. They rarely chase so it can be very easy to fall into the trap of thinking almost all girls want just a tiny handful of guys because they never openly admit to liking anyone else. By that same token it is very easy to lump yourself in with the majority of the guys that leaves out.\n\nIt should go without saying that it is not true. You do not really even need to be particularly good at meeting women to get a date with most girls, you just need the confidence to talk to them. Girls are just like guys in that they can be attracted to you with the smallest of cues. Where men differ is that they typically go on looks while girls go on sub communications. If you walk around a venue with ease and with the kind of body language described above, exuding confidence as you go, women will be drawn to you.\n\n\nDon't get attached to an outcome. Look only to have fun. This means not worrying too much about where you are in the triad model (Love Systems speak for the blueprint of a successful interaction), or trying to find opportunities to show her how cool you are, or throw in a particular routine you have had memorized all night.\n\nThe easiest way to be outcome independent is to have an abundance mindset. Unfortunately, getting to that point requires being good at meeting women and if you were there you probably would not be reading this. Instead, you can fake it until you make it. Act as though you have many beautiful women in your life, think that way, even try to convince yourself. At least understand that what this one girl, who does not know you, thinks of you means nothing. Also, remember that women are not rejecting you, they are rejecting your skill set if you fail. A skill set which you are working on and with practice will get better at. So do not berate yourself or get caught up in destructive negative thought patterns that you allow to define and rule you.\n\n\nKnow that it is perfectly normal to want and have sex. It is not a big deal and it is not a prize to be won. This is huge. The kind of guy who can define their view on sex by the words in this song probably gets very little.\n\nAdopting a mindset in which you believe that girls wanting to have sex with you is perfectly normal is difficult but not impossible. Again, it's another fake it until you make it belief.\nAlso, realizing that girls want to and will sleep with a guy the same night they meet allows you to radiate confidence and a lack of judgement. So many guys, particularly ones who have very options in life when it comes to dating (aka most guys), believe that if a girl sleeps with you the same night or on a first or second date (in other words doesn't make you jump through a massive bunch of hoops) then she is clearly someone of low standards. This is not true at all. If the only girls you have ever \"pulled\" (for want of a better term) have been very easy girls, the kind that have little in the way of standards, then it is easy to see how it would seem logical to draw this conclusion.\nThe truth is that some girls will have sex with the right guy shortly after meeting them (there are of course exceptions to this). It is just that simple! Whilst it may seem like they have a lot of choice, and in a way they do (any girl, even the fattest ugliest women, could realistically get more sex than any guy by just asking for it), women who do not screen potential sexual partners are deemed careless, are at risk of harm, pregnancy, cervical cancer, STD's and lose social status. They are also often judged negatively by the very guys they have sex with which adds an extra element of risk, and in the past will likely have been dumped shortly after having sex. Because of these, and some other factors (including ending up with a guy who rings ten times a day and cannot accept it was just a one night stand), women do not just take whatever is offered.\nBe the guy they can comfortably express their sexuality with, without judgment. Allow women to be free of the normal social constraints around you and they will thank you for it.\n\n\nWomen are your playmates, not your opponents. Ever wondered why it's so easy for some guys and yet every other guy struggles to pull? It is almost like a little secret women have with guys who \"get it\". Understand how the process works: the need for the \"bitch shield\" (the mechanism by which girls will outright reject an approach), the problem with nice guys, the natural hatred towards the sleazy guy, the need to protect their reputation, logistics, the fear of negative judgment from the guys they meet, the need for plausible deniability and the requirement that as the man, it is up to you to make it happen. So with that being said, do not think of sex as a prize that women hand out when you have jumped through their hoops, just understand that there is a need for women to screen. As a guy who understands this, you share in the secret and can confidently pass the screening process.\nUnderstand that they are expecting you to lead. On the same note, look for the absence of a red light rather than a green light. Not all girls are so forward as to actively indicate interest but this doesn't mean they are not into you. So keep moving forward, keep pushing boundaries and always be closing. Do not just go for the number, go for more. Attempt a kiss close; or if it's late, and you have been with her a little while, suggest leaving together.\nRecognize their femininity. As a man you should want to hold her and protect her. Be the man that she can be the princess with and be taken care of. Let her be soft, gentle and vulnerable around you. This extreme polarity of your strong masculinity to their vulnerable femininity will be a key to success. When you a similar mindset, and you hold that belief to be true, then it becomes very easy to convey many of the attractive qualities without having to say a word. They will see it in your eyes and feel it in your presence.\nRemember, practice is key. You have to get used to being out of your comfort zone to get good at meeting women and having a life of choice. This is referred to as the pendulum effect, go way beyond what works and then come back the other way until you find a balance. So go out and test the waters, practice all of it and push boundaries. Do not be afraid because of some perceived notion of negative consequence, typically the worst that will happen is that you get rejected in a slightly harsher than normal way but that is not so bad.\n\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_056", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nThree happy marriages, beginning to crack; three dissatisfied blondes; and, crawling out from the cracks, the thought of violent crime. Such is the substance of three new films, all derived from works by popular authors. The longest is “Gone Girl,” adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own novel; the most nattily dressed is “The Two Faces of January,” taken from Patricia Highsmith; and last, courtesy of Georges Simenon, comes “The Blue Room,” the Frenchest of the three, so much so that the plot relies on confiture de prunes. \n \n “Gone Girl,” directed by David Fincher, starts with Nick (Ben Affleck)—in his own words, “a corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth Missouri boy.” He used to live in New York and write for magazines, but the work dried up and he returned home, to the uneventful town of North Carthage, with his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike). According to your point of view (and the film is all about viewpoints, and the urge to shuffle them around), Amy is one or more of the following: the inspiration for the “Amazing Amy” series of children’s books, written by her parents; a flat-out dazzler, too cool for the neighborhood; a rich kid, spawned by a snotty family; the original desperate housewife, becalmed and unadored; or a heap of trouble—the Clytemnestra of the Midwest. Oh, and another thing. She may be dead. \n \n Nick owns a bar with his twin sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), and he stops there one morning for an early Scotch. He then drives home to find the front door open, a glass table smashed, and no sign of his wife. Their cat is a witness, but, if it knows anything, it’s not coughing up. The police arrive, and Detective Boney (Kim Dickens) declares a missing-persons case; before long, Nick is knee-deep in press conferences, candlelit vigils, and public appeals, flashing a polite, reluctant grin that is parsed, by tabloids and TV hosts, as proof of guilt. (You can’t blame them. The Affleck smile, from the dawn of his career, has looked more creepy than consolatory—softening that firm, all-American jaw but never quite reaching the eyes.) Suddenly, after an hour, we flip to Amy, and to her version of what happened—so different, and so close to wacko, that it seems like another story altogether. I would happily unveil the rest of it, but, in deference to the twenty-one people who have yet to read the novel, I will say nothing more without a lawyer present. \n \n At first blush, “Gone Girl” is natural Fincherland. Not geographically; he seems less absorbed in North Carthage, described by Amy as “the navel of the country,” than he was in the California of “Zodiac” or the Harvard of “The Social Network.” Those are his masterpieces: the two movies that I can’t not watch when they turn up on TV, and the two occasions on which his pedantry and his paranoia have fused together, engrossing us in a crazed aggregation of detail. Nothing could equip him better for the coiled and clustered goings on in the new film, and, for good measure, he has hired Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whom he last used for “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” to compose the score. They don’t let him down. “Gone Girl” boasts one major act of savagery, drenched in a downpour of blood, and what we hear during it sounds like the wah-wah pedal of Satan. So why doesn’t the movie claw us as “The Social Network” did? Who could have predicted that a film about murder, betrayal, and deception would be less exciting than a film about a Web site? \n \n The glum fact is that “Gone Girl” lacks clout where it needs it most, at its core. We are accustomed to Fincher’s heroes being as obsessively smart as he is, if lacking his overarching patience, whereas Nick remains, to put it gently, a lunkhead. Amy has twice the brain, and ten times the cunning, but, despite the best efforts of Rosamund Pike, her character, onscreen as on the page, feels cooked up rather than lived in. That can work on film, as shown by another beauty, Gene Tierney, in “Laura” and “Leave Her to Heaven,” but the scheming of Tierney’s heroines was matched by a rare, ornate febrility in the movies themselves. Fincher’s method, on the other hand, is dogged and downbeat, so that Amy sticks out like a cartoon in a newsreel. (One expected the same of the title character in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” who was equally extreme, but somehow Rooney Mara gave her life—all drilled intensity where Pike offers elegant drift.) “Gone Girl” is meant to inspire debates about whether Amy is victimized or vengeful, and whether Nick deserves everything he gets, but, really, who cares? All I could think of was the verdict of Samuel Butler on Thomas Carlyle: “It was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle marry one another, and so make only two people miserable and not four.” Or, in the words of Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), Nick’s unflappable attorney: “You two are the most fucked-up people I have ever met, and I specialize in fucked-up people.” \n \n Perry has a grand time. His wave to the press corps, camped out on Nick’s sidewalk, is a cool mixture of dismissal and salute. He knows that our attention is straying from the main couple toward the outlying figures: Tanner himself, Detective Boney, and, best of all, Margo—a fine performance, both grounded and wounded, from Carrie Coon. Against that, we have Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), a wealthy ex of Amy’s, wandering in as if from another film, and eating up the final slice of the action with a silly Gothic subplot. It comes straight from the novel, and you can picture the outcry if Fincher had chopped or changed it, but so what? A director’s task is not to suck up to readers, or to flatter his source, but to imagine it afresh, as film, while seizing on those aspects that matter to him most. What grabs Fincher about “Gone Girl,” I suspect, is not the mystery in Missouri but the sight of a media wolf pack in full cry. Hence the time that he devotes to two cable-TV hosts, played by Sela Ward and Missi Pyle, who rifle through Nick’s privacy, and his state of mind, in their lust for a story. Fincher is right: these days they are the story, and I wish that he would tell it again from their angle, through the eyes of bloggers, and via the phones of the people we see laughing outside Nick’s bar, taking selfies at a hot spot of fame. So, “Gone Girl Redux”: the campaign starts here. ||||| Even with the well-established praise for director David Fincher as a master filmmaker — his movies lushly drenched in shadow, his capacity for tough stuff matched only by his care in presentation — it’s easy to forget or overlook his sense of humor, the spoonful of sugar that helps the malevolence go down in his films. \n \n At his best, Fincher has a sense of humor that not only cuts through the darkness but actually contrasts it to significant effect. After the dour, sour, sadistic Scandanavian misfire of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” it’s a pleasure to note that Fincher’s latest adaptation, of Gillian Flynn’s best-selling novel of the same name, is both wicked and wickedly fun. \n \n Not only brutal but also brutally funny, “Gone Girl” mixes top-notch suspenseful storytelling with the kind of razor-edged wit that slashes so quick and clean you’re still watching the blade go past before you notice you’re bleeding. \n \n See video: New ‘Gone Girl’ Trailer Suggests That Ben Affleck Murdered His Wife (Video) \n \n Like some mix of “Scenes from a Marriage” and “Ace in The Hole” as shot by Michael Mann with a Hitchcock Blonde to kill (or die) for in the lead, “Gone Girl” tells the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). The film begins in New Carthage, Mo., on their fifth anniversary; Nick runs a few errands and blows off some steam, returning home to find an empty house, an upended coffee table shattered in the living room, and no sign of Amy. \n \n When the cops (played by the superb Kim Dickens and a mostly silent but excellent Patrick Fugit) arrive, it’s clear there’s been a struggle inside the Dunne’s house; as Nick and Amy narrate their marriage to us and the police investigate an ever-increasing number of clues, though, it’s clear there were signs of struggle inside the Dunne’s marriage as well. \n \n Made up of police inquiries and diary entries, love stories and other fake-outs, “Gone Girl” is, in no small part, a story about storytelling and the difference between perception and reality, with comforting tales interrupted by the low, ominous thud of the metaphorical other shoe dropping. Amy’s mom and dad are best-selling authors of children’s books, with their series “Amazing Amy” an improved version of their daughter’s life; Nick and Amy’s American dream marriage with the big house and the big love looks is utterly perfect until you shake it and the rot comes spilling out. \n \n Also read: Tyler Perry’s ‘For Better or Worse’ Fall Premiere Draws Best Ratings Since OWN Series Debut \n \n And when upsetting revelations come out in the case, celebrity defense attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry, a natural as a hearty, likable cynic with great media presence) smoothly states how “We’ll have to … realign the public’s perception …” \n \n Flynn’s script is loaded with nicely-tuned observations, not just about the rules and rituals of the modern American marriage but also about a media that shrieks speculation more than it speaks the truth and worries about slogans more than facts. The author’s clever, cruel and cool work also gives Pike the role of a lifetime in the shining, secretive Amy, while still making her human and comprehensible. Affleck, who’s personally had to endure a level of media scrutiny that makes a colonoscopy look dignified, brings much of that history to Nick’s affability and desire to please. When he needs to play the part, Nick does, but he’s not as smart as he thinks he is. Both performers are brilliant. \n \n Also read: Ben Affleck Admits to Being Really Good at Counting Cards in Blackjack \n \n With its shifting perspectives and timelines, its constant conflict between what’s said and what’s truly seen, “Gone Girl” is clean, clear, and perfectly constructed. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and editor Jeff Baxter, both regular Fincher collaborators, deliver the kind of work that looks easy but, assuredly and on reflection, is decidedly not. The score, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is a more mixed proposition, effective in the places it works and distracting on several occasions where it doesn’t. \n \n The supporting cast is a thing of wonder — there are familiar faces like Dickens, Fugit, and Perry all pushed to greatness, with Missi Pyle perfect as the film’s version of harridan-for-justice Nancy Grace, Neil Patrick Harris elegantly worrisome as on old suitor of Amy’s, and Carrie Coon (“The Leftovers”) a revelation as Nick’s loving, tough sister Margot. \n \n Also read: 7 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall 2014 – From a ‘Gone Girl’ to a ‘Maze Runner’ \n \n The best Hitchcock films struck a balance between elegance and violence, a peculiar mix of champagne fizz and spilled crimson blood; “Gone Girl,” with its giddy revelations and grim-grin reversals incorporating ugly facts and uglier fictions, fits perfectly into a modernized version of that superb tradition. \n \n “Gone Girl” portrays marriage not just as warfare by other means but as many different kinds of battle — class conflict, sexual gamesmanship, wrangling over money, fighting over the future — with plenty of blood spilled.

Until then it’s brilliant, not just a triumph of story but of strategy, a movie that keeps the audience grasping and reaching in all the wrong directions, while consistently delivering something a little better, a little crazier and a little more disturbing than expected. \n \n And then before it’s over, it all kind of goes ... not to hell — it’s not as bad as that — but to purgatory, or limbo. This most satisfying of films turns dissatisfying. This Swiss watch of storytelling turns into a bad digital clock circa 1986, flashing the wrong numbers. If only the dip in quality came in the middle, or even at the beginning, we might still be able to class “Gone Girl” as among the year's best. But when a movie, in its final minutes, forsakes its own logic and embraces false cleverness, that can’t be ignored. \n \n “Gone Girl” is based on Gillian Flynn’s enormously popular novel of the same name, and the novel’s very popularity might be the main problem here. There are things that can work in print that just can’t be made to work onscreen. Yet when it’s an acclaimed story that half the audience will know going in, no broad changes can be considered, even ones for the better. \n \n Latest entertainment videos Now Playing: Now Playing Parents Prank Kids With Light Bulb and Ironing Board on Christmas Eve Storyful \n \n Jessica Alba Welcomes Third Child with Cash Warren InStyleTime \n \n New Year 2018 accidents already brings death, injury and destruction Euronews_News \n \n Las Vegas Rings in 2018 Under Unprecedented Security TMTime \n \n Kevin McCarthy has the movies to look forward to in 2018 Fox5DC \n \n 'Real Housewives' Star Going To Rehab Following Arrest Buzz60 \n \n 'Real Housewives' Star Going To Rehab Following Arrest Veuer \n \n Does this all sound vague? Alas, we’re going to have to hover in the Land of Vague in discussing “Gone Girl,” because this is just one of those movies: Give away too much of the story, and you’ve just killed about three-quarters of its appeal. \n \n Story of marriage \n \n So we’ll stay general. “Gone Girl” is the story of a marriage, as well as a pretty straight-faced satire — or is it an indictment? — of the way gossip is passed off as news on cable television. Ben Affleck plays Nick, a guy with a cloud of sadness around him, who goes home to find that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), is missing and that there are signs of a struggle. He calls the police, who, being cops, start suspecting him of murder. But who knows? This time they could be right. \n \n For the first hour, “Gone Girl” takes place on two tracks. It follows Nick in the present day, as he becomes the center of both the investigation and of the media’s piranha-like lust. And it goes back in time, telling the tale of Nick and Amy’s courtship and marriage as related (and narrated) by Amy in her diary. \n \n Juicy roles \n \n Affleck has had good roles before, but I don’t think he has ever had one that capitalizes on as much of what he can do onscreen. He is a big slab of a guy, but his aura is not of strength, but of uncertainty, perhaps moral weakness. He is instantly likable and then occasionally, upon reflection, dislikable. He has a blitheness that is either amusing or engaging or off-putting, depending on the viewer's angle. He can just as easily charm the world as irritate millions — he has literally done both, in real life — so anybody’s reaction to him is easy to believe, so long as it's extreme. \n \n Rosamund Pike will come as more of a surprise. Her previous roles have hinted at her intelligence and ability — she even made audiences believe she was in love with a cigar-chomping Paul Giamatti in “Barney’s Version” — but this is the juiciest role she has had to date, and she makes a meal of it. Everyone who sees “Gone Girl” will walk out raving about Rosamund Pike. \n \n Director David Fincher lands a tone for “Gone Girl” that’s broad and precise enough to encourage a series of witty performances within the thriller framework. The story may be the star here, but everyone is vivid within it, not just the principals, but Kim Dickens as a detective, Tyler Perry as a hotshot lawyer and Carrie Coon as Affleck's twin sister. \n \n And then it all sort of ... “implodes” would be too strong a word. Perhaps “frays?” “Becomes dented?” “Loses its glow?” But that’s all in the last 20 minutes. Try to put it out of your mind for those first two hours. \n \n Mick LaSalle is The Chronicle’s movie critic.

{"id": "summarization_058", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \n Choosing a rifle of insufficient quality or too expensive to shoot may greatly reduce your ability in the field.\n\n\nConsider the brand of the rifle. Most brand names are good buys, but, in the current active gun-buying market, can often be overpriced. Shop around, as prices at local dealer and on-line auction prices can vary considerably.\nAs a rule of thumb, bolt-action rifles are usually more accurate and have a slightly higher muzzle velocity than an equivalent (price and quality) semi-automatic (auto-loading) rifle. The current crop of AR15 variants have achieved much higher accuracy, and are often advertised as capable of sub-MOA (Minute Of Angle) accuracy. This means they can group shots within one \"minute\" of angle (roughly 1\" at 100 yards) which is competitive with the better bolt guns.\nFaster rifle twist ratios allow for heavier bullets to be shot more accurately through the rifle. For example, a .223 barrel with a twist ratio of 1:12 may only be able to shoot a 40-52 grain bullet accurately, while a barrel with a twist ratio of 1:9 will be able to shoot, accurately, any bullet between 40 and 65 grains, it will also compensate (to a point) the .223's tendency to tumble after penetrating a target.\n\nThere are drawbacks to higher twist ratios though, muzzle velocity may be reduced by a percent or two, there can be extra wear and tear on the barrel, and over-stabilization of the bullet can result in less damage to the target (these are minor drawbacks, however).\n\n;\n, Stick to rifle-style rounds (easily identifiable by a necked-down casing, unlike the .22 where the case is the same diameter from end to end). These rounds have a much higher powder to bullet weight ratio, which results in higher muzzle velocities. Of course, if the cost of doing so is too high, .22lr practice will at least get you trigger time with plenty of economy.\n\n, It is more consistent and uses higher quality bullets; for plinking, cheap ammunition selection is fine.\n\n, Low report (noise) and low recoil make it less likely to startle your prey if you miss, and quicker on follow up shots. Some of the more powerful .224 caliber rounds work quite well and will extend your range well past that of the .22lr.\n\n, Though it is possible to kill this size of animal with smaller rounds, it becomes essential to get a head or heart shot; else the animal may die a slow painful death, or not die at all. Though for smaller animals a round as large as a .308 will be approaching the range of overkill, something in between these sizes is recommended.\n\n, Even a .223 could kill these animals, but with smaller rounds, the bullet precision is much more important. If using smaller diameter rounds for large game, heavier bullets will transfer energy more quickly into the target.\n\n\nLarger calibers such as the .338 Winchester Magnum or 45-70 and larger are helpful for use against very large wild game such as buffalo, or dangerous game abroad. However many people will suggest that accuracy is more important for hunting than caliber size, for instance some guides would have a client use a .270 for animals like bear and moose if they can shoot it accurately over a higher powered cartridge like the .300 Winchester Magnum.\n\n,, Bullet weight is expressed in GRAINS, a common measure of gunpowder and bullet weight.\n\n\nLight bullets are often favored for varmint and target shooting. The higher velocity allows a flat trajectory within a couple hundred yards of the muzzle. The bullet reaches the target quicker, so less leading is required as well.\nHeavier bullets are preferred for game shooting. On contact with target, it delivers more energy in a shorter amount of time (which is more lethal). It may also reduce the likelihood of over-penetration. Over longer distances, due to ballistic coefficients (how streamlined the bullet is as it flies through the air), heavier bullets can produce flatter trajectories than light bullets, and are ultimately less affected by crosswind.\nAn example for a .223 (each caliber and rifle will behave differently): a 42 grain bullet (3700 FPS) at 100 yards (91.4 m) will drop (with no sight-zero) about an inch and a half. At 500 yards (457.2 m), it will drop probably around four feet and maintains about 80% of its velocity. A 65 grain bullet (3000FPS) at 100 yards (91.4 m) will drop two inches, but at 500 yards (457.2 m) will only drop three feet. At 500 yards (457.2 m) the bullet maintains about 85% of its velocity.\nAs a point of interest, if a bullet is dropped from your hand at exactly the same time as the same weight bullet leaves the muzzle of the rifle (fired horizontally to ground), BOTH bullets will hit the ground at the same time. Gravity has the same effect on a bullet that is stationary as it does on a bullet that is flying through the air.\n\n, Insert a yellow plastic \"empty chamber indicator\" when handling guns.\n\n, High velocity rifle rounds are capable of traveling miles. Most bullets can easily penetrate drywall in a home.\n\n, Otherwise, keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction (at the ground).\n\n,,, All the rules should be followed at all times.\n\n, You want to be able to position yourself comfortably. When shooting paper targets (and the like), comfort is your number one goal. You want to be able to practice at your optimal performance. When shooting animals, you want to be invisible to them. Even squirrels have a very keen sense of predators (that's you). If they see you, they'll likely run, and it may take several minutes before they brave the open land again.\n\n\nWith animals, height advantage is good. It allows you to see more area. But be sure to conceal most of your body in a thicket, tall brush, or by crawling.\nWith larger game, studying their patterns and location over multiple trips to the same area can be very useful; if you know a deer's escape route is past a long straight path, force them to run their escape, post on the path, and wait for them to cross.\n\n, Although, this is less of a stance and more of a location of your rifle. This allows your rifle to rest on something other than you or the ground.\n\n\nIt gives the most stable platform without human input. This allows you to sight in your sights or scope, so you know when you are holding the gun that it is your fault when you miss. If you are planning on hunting you should get better at the below stances because you are probably not going to take a bench with you on your hunt.\n\n, The most common position is lying on your belly with your legs spread out, your feet arch down partly embedded in the ground and the rifle tight in your shoulder. The position will look like you are in a \" Y \" shape. This position is the most stable prone position as to have the recoil be absorbed through your body. This will cut the recoil enough to give you better accuracy at longer ranges. Also as a note, your breathing has the most effect on your shot.\n\n\nWith a bipod or some other way to hold the front of the gun, it is often best to put your support (non-trigger) hand under the butt of the stock. This allows you to position the elevation of the sights or scope more precisely.\nIf there is no bipod or other item to hold the front of the gun, your support hand should hold the front of the gun, this is less accurate than a bipod so invest in a good quality leather military style sling. Use a \"loop sling\" position. This is made by having the sling connected to the front swivel and the other end in a loop to go as high up on your bicep as possible. Then put your arm through the area between the rifle and sling. Then in a clockwise motion end up with the forward hand gripping the rifle under the front stock close to the swivel.\nYou also have the option of making a make-shift bipod or tripod, or resting the front of the rifle on some other stable platform, like a backpack.\n\n, There are many stances for crouching.\n\n\nA common one is to sit on one foot laid sideways on the ground while putting your other foot in front of you as tight to your body as possible, this will bring your knee toward your face. Having something against your back is never a bad idea. You then place the rifle in your hand which is resting on the knee in front of you.\nYou can also kneel or crouch behind anything hard, and rest the front of your gun (or bipod preferably) on it. Or you can use a \"kneeling roll\", this is nothing more than an old carpet, shirt or old pant leg rolled up and duct taped stuck up where the laces in your boot are and the ground. This position also requires a \"trick\", to make you more stable, point your forward foot's toes inboard to your trigger fingers arm. You should be able to make accurate shots at 450 yards (411.5 m) with this position.\n\n, However, the best way to stand is against a tree or a rock to reduce some of the sway.\n\n\nYet another trick is to start with the rifle in your shoulder, pointed up at the sky, your trigger hand on the stock and your supporting arm on the fore-end stock. Bring the rifle down meanwhile tuck your supporting arm into your hip, lean back and calmly breathe at the same time your cheek weld is being applied. You can shoot accurately up to 300 yards (274.3 m) like this with proper practice.\n\n, This often changes from person to person and changes a good deal depending on the situation. But the most common rifle position is the butt of the stock in the pocket of your shoulder (just above your armpit), your cheek lightly against the stock, looking down the sights or scope in the most relaxed position possible. For larger caliber rifles with more kick, the rifle should be brought in some so the butt is resting partially on the pectoral muscle.\n\n\nA critical component of sniping is acquiring a good \"cheek weld\" or \"stock weld\". This means your cheek bone is held fast against the butt stock to insure proper sight alignment and sight picture. The pocket of your shoulder will absorb the recoil. Without a good cheek weld, parallax in your scope is guaranteed and you will never become proficient with any sniper weapon system/ optic-equipped rifle.\n\n, The forearm should be pretty far forward on a traditional length grip which goes about 14 inches (35.6 cm) in front of the receiver.\n\n, This affects the sway and oscillation of the gun, which in turn affects how consistent your shots can be.\n\n\nNote: It also helps to practice 'stress firing', where you must take hasty shots with fatigue. Try running a quarter mile or whatever will bring up your heart rate and do enough push-ups so that your arms are twitching. Learn to compensate for the trembling in your muscles. If you only shoot paper targets, you can skip this, but in hunting or combat you may not have the luxury of rested muscles. At a minimum, try it as an experiment just to see to what degree stress impacts your ability to engage targets.\nThere are many different techniques for breathing while standing, often it is recommended to have your lungs most of the way full. Hold your breath and wait until the reticle goes over your target.\nIf you are a sniper, a sling is essential. Firing in a standing position is very fatiguing, especially supporting the barrel. A sling will help support the weight and allow the shooter a much higher degree of accuracy.\nFor prone and kneeling, it is best to open your mouth and throat until your body is relaxed, this is when most of your air has exited your lungs. Relax, if your heart rate is slow enough, you can stay like this for 10 or 15 seconds, be patient and wait until the reticle stops over your target.\nOnce you practice while exhaled a few times you will notice the reticle bounces in sync with your heart beat. You want to fire between beats (on the downbeat of your heart) which allows the most time for a stable shot (this will be only a fraction of a second, but that is when you are able to be most accurate).\nTry to avoid eye fatigue. If you stare through the scope for more than 15 seconds, you are bound to develop parallax or lose focus on your target.\n\n, When pulling the trigger (with any type of trigger), be sure to pull the trigger straight back toward your shoulder. Keep your firing hand and support hand loose and relaxed. You want to squeeze slowly, and release the hammer precisely when over the intended target.\n\n\nIf it will not damage your weapon, practice 'dry fire' exercises to develop good trigger control. It can help you develop skill without wasting ammunition or being so 'spooked' by the recoil you cannot focus on the trigger tension.\nIf the gun does not have a set trigger, then it likely has a trigger pull of about 2-5 pounds. In this case, you must get used to your trigger. Practice pulling the trigger most of the way back, just before the point the hammer releases. Try doing that until you are at the point that you can release the hammer (smoothly) on command. It is important never to fire before you want to, so be sure there is some threshold where you stop.\nNOTE: Precision sniper rifles have two-stage triggers, so that you will know when you are about to fire. Otherwise the advice above is golden. If you do not pull the slack out of the trigger before committing to the shot, you are virtually guaranteed to miss your target. This applies to ALL firearms. Even black-powder rifles had two separate triggers, the second being the 'hair trigger'.\nWith a set trigger, the trigger pull is closer to 8-14 ounces. This makes life much easier. The effort to pull the trigger can be done as soon as you intend to shoot. Be sure to practice and get used to the light pull.\n\n, The power can range from 1.5x to 50x for conventional rifles. Standard combat rifles or varmint rifles are usually zeroed at 100 yards (91.4 m) (we will assume, from now on, 100 yards is zero distance).\n\n\nDepending on the selected zero range, bullet, and rifle (you must do research or testing to find the case with your setup) this may mean the bullet is below the reticle before zero, then above after zero, and eventually falls again to (at a different distance) be lined up with the reticle again (this may be 120 yards or 300, and it will likely change from rifle to rifle, even in the same caliber).\n\nAnother scenario is that the bullet climbs sooner, and from (say) 40 to 100 yards (36.6 to 91.4 m) is above the reticle, it then falls to meet your zero, and from then on (100 and more yards) is below the reticle (this is likely low-power rifles like .22LR).\n\n\nThe most conventional way to zero the scope is to fire a shot. Determine how far off target the bullet lands, then adjust the scope accordingly. Most scopes have windage and elevation knobs which can be turned to compensate for inaccuracies. The elevation is usually on the top and affects the bullet's point of impact (POI) vertically. The windage is usually on the right side of the scope and affects the bullet's POI horizontally.\nMost scopes have either mil-dot or ballistic plex reticle which allows the shooter to easily line up a shot at distances further than the zeroed point. Most scopes come with a chart to show based on the bullet's caliber and weight where to line up the reticle. Though it would be much more accurate if you make your own chart.\nWhile military snipers practice adjusting the windage and elevation for the specific situation, it usually isn't practical for hunters or recreational shooters to measure wind speed and other factors to the target and adjust the scope. It is often best just to do approximate calculations and \"hold-off\" the reticle, so re-zeroing the scope is not necessary. There are many factors that need to be taken into account when adjusting the scope, here are a few of them (in general order of priority):\n\n\nDistance to target, bullet velocity, cross wind, bullet weight, shot angle, and others.\nThere are computer or PDA calculators which can calculate the exact landing position of the bullet based on all the information above (at least the major points). The calculators usually assume you re-zero your reticle. That is the best way to be perfectly accurate, but for target shooting where you don't need a one-shot-one-kill, re-zeroing is a lot of hassle.\n\n\nScopes (except low-end scopes) also have adjustable parallaxes which allow the shooter to essentially place the reticle on the same distance plane as the target. This is essential to take an accurate shot. Most parallaxes have distances listed on them, use them as basic guidelines.\n\nA way to \"cheat\" the parallax is to place your head in a relief position where you can see black around the edge while viewing down the scope. Move your head and eye to make the black area even on all edges around the reticle.\n\n\nRead How to Use a Rifle Scope for more information on most of the points in this section.\n\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_059", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nThe Hate Crime Statistics Act\nThe HCSA requires DOJ to collect and report data on crimes that \"manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including where appropriate the crimes of murder, non-negligent manslaughter; forcible rape; aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation; arson; and destruction, damage or vandalism of property.\" Congress required DOJ to collect these data because, at the time, few states collected data on hate crimes and there were no national data. Policymakers believed that national data would reveal the scope of the problem and provide a basis for more effective law enforcement efforts to address hate crimes. \nOver the years since the HCSA was enacted, Congress has expanded the definition of what constitutes a hate crime for data collection purposes. The act initially required DOJ to collect data on hate crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. In 2009, Congress amended the act to require DOJ to collect data on hate crimes based on the victims' gender or gender identity ( P.L. 111-84 ) or disability ( P.L. 103-322 ). P.L. 111-84 also required DOJ to collect and report data on hate crimes committed by and against juveniles.\nThe HCSA initially included a sunset provision that would have ended the requirement for DOJ to collect hate crime data after 1994. However, the Church Arson Prevention Act ( P.L. 104-155 ) removed that provision. \nFederal Hate Crime Data\nTo meet the requirements of the HCSA and subsequent amendments, DOJ collects and reports data on hate crimes that occur in the United States through two sources: the Hate Crime Statistics program and the NCVS.\nDifferences in the Two National Measures of Hate Crimes\nA perennial issue that can cause confusion for those unfamiliar with the FBI's and BJS's data collection goals and methodologies is the difference between the number of hate crime incidents reported by the FBI and the number of hate crime victimizations reported by BJS. For example, for 2018 (the most recent data available) the FBI reported that there were approximately 7,100 hate crime incidents that involved approximately 8,800 victims. In comparison, BJS reported that there were an estimated 198,000 hate crime victimizations in 2017. \nWhat might explain the difference in the two national measures of hate crimes? The answer lies partially in the fact that the data reported by the FBI and BJS reflect different goals for collecting data on hate crimes. The FBI data only reflect hate crime incidents that are reported to law enforcement, and where law enforcement concludes that a hate crime has occurred and reports it to the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics Program. In contrast, the goal of the NCVS hate crime data collection effort is to estimate the total number of hate crime victimizations that occur each year, including victimizations that are not reported to law enforcement agencies (i.e., a portion of the dark figure of crime). Because the NCVS collects data on reported and unreported hate crime victimizations, its totals will always be larger than the FBI's hate crime data. \nAnother explanation for the difference between the two measures are the different standards needed to be met to be counted as a hate crime in the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics Program and the NCVS. For a hate crime to be counted by the FBI, law enforcement must have sufficient evidence that would lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by his or her bias. In contrast, under the NCVS, an incident is counted as a hate crime if the victim believes that the offense was based on their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity, and the offender used hate language, hate symbols, or a law enforcement investigation concluded that a hate crime had occurred. An independent investigation of the perceived bias is not necessary in every case for the NCVS interviewers to include the offense as a hate crime. \nThe goals and methodologies described above help explain why the NCVS estimates of hate crime victimizations are higher than the number of hate crime incidents reported by the FBI. At the same time, the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics Program collects data on a larger number of victim types and crimes that may be motivated by the offender's bias than the NCVS. For example, the FBI collects data on bias motivated homicides and vandalisms, which are not be captured by the NCVS. Law enforcement agencies can also report data on hate crimes against individuals, businesses, religious institutions, other institutions, and society as a whole to the FBI, whereas the NCVS only collects data on hate crimes against individuals (i.e., personal crimes) and households (i.e., property crimes).\nAre Hate Crimes Underreported to the FBI by Law Enforcement?\nA common criticism of the FBI's hate crime data is that a large proportion of participating law enforcement agencies report zero hate crimes in a given year ( zero-reporting agencies ), leading some advocacy groups to accuse the zero-reporting agencies of underreporting hate crimes. The evidence presented to support these accusations are discrepancies between hate crime figures reported by the FBI and the self-reported hate crime figures tabulated by community organizations serving the communities that are often the targets of hate crime (e.g., organizations serving the LGBTQ, Jewish, Muslim, or Arab communities).\nResearch suggests that some law enforcement agencies have underreported the number of hate crime incidents to the FBI. In one study, researchers reviewed a sample of assault incident reports from seven local law enforcement agencies across the country that were not classified as hate crimes to see if there was any indication that the offenses had a bias motivation. Incidents where there was a clear indication that bias was a predominant motivating factor in the assault were coded as bias- motivated , and other incidents were coded as ambiguous if there was an indication of bias but also evidence of some other identifiable triggering event or alternative motivation. The study found that for some of the incidents, there was evidence that they were motivated by the alleged perpetrator's bias, but that these misclassification errors were relatively infrequent and varied by law enforcement agency. The estimated proportion of misclassified cases for each agency ranged from zero to 8% of all assault incidents when both bias- motivated and ambiguous incidents were considered and from zero to 3% when only bias- motivated cases were considered. While the proportion of misclassified assault cases for any individual agency is relatively low, if the percentage of misclassified cases reported in this study was generalizable to the universe of all assaults, it would account for thousands of hate crimes that were not reported to the Hate Crime Statistics Program. \nAnother study of the accuracy of hate crime reporting utilized incident-based crime data (see discussion of expanding the National Incident Based Reporting System, below) from four local law enforcement agencies to evaluate whether hate crimes were being misclassified. This study looked at all criminal incidents, not just assaults, reported to the four agencies in 2008 and examined not only whether hate crimes were misclassified as non-bias-motivated offenses, but also whether non-bias-motivated offenses were wrongly classified as hate crimes and how these errors compared to misclassification errors for other non-hate crimes. This study found that undercounting of hate crimes was the most common misclassification error in the records they examined. The researchers noted that \"extending error rates to the population suggest that the estimated number of bias crimes that go unaccounted is noticeable.\"\nEven though the research described above did not focus on local law enforcement agencies who reported zero hate crimes, it is these agencies in particular that critics argue are likely to have underreported hate crimes. As shown in Figure 1 , the vast majority of agencies that participate in the Hate Crime Statistics Program are zero-reporting agencies, leading critics to assume that hate crimes are significantly underreported to the FBI. \nIn order for a law enforcement agency to be considered a \"participant,\" it has to submit data on the number of hate crimes for at least part of the year or a letter signed by the police chief certifying that no hate crimes occurred that year in its jurisdiction. From 1996 to 2017, at least 80% of Hate Crime Statistics Program participating law enforcement agencies in any given year reported zero hate crimes. The proportion of participating law enforcement agencies that were zero-reporting agencies generally increased from 2001 to 2014. There was a slight decrease in this proportion after 2014, but in 2018 nearly 9 out of 10 participating law enforcement agencies reported zero hate crimes. \nAside from misclassification errors, there are several reasons that might explain why a law enforcement agency does not report any hate crimes in a given year. The first, and most straightforward, reason is because no hate crimes occurred. Given that law enforcement agency jurisdictions include communities with as little as a few hundred residents, it is not implausible that some residents, especially those that live in very small and homogeneous communities, did not experience any hate crimes. Second, in order for a law enforcement agency to report a hate crime to the FBI, it must be reported to the police. Data from the NCVS indicates that on average, half of hate crime victimizations were not reported to the police from 2013 to 2017. Hate crime victims might choose not to report the incident to the police for a variety of reasons, including \nfear of retaliation, embarrassment that they were victimized, a belief that the crime was not motivated by the perpetrator's bias, lack of familiarity with a state's hate crime laws, distrust of law enforcement, a belief that law enforcement will not investigate the case, fear of being exposed as a member of the LGBTQ community, or fear of being re-traumatized by the criminal justice system.\nEven when a hate crime is reported to state and local law enforcement, an investigation must be conducted into the perceived bias to determine if the offense was bias-motivated before reporting it to the FBI as a hate crime. This step can be challenging for law enforcement agencies, especially small agencies with relatively few resources. When there is evidence that a hate crime might have occurred, law enforcement agencies have to complete additional investigative steps to determine whether an offense meets the statutory definition of a hate crime, and in some cases law enforcement officers might not be trained sufficiently on recognizing biases in crimes to conduct such investigations. Few states provide mandatory training for law enforcement officers on investigating, identifying, and reporting hate crimes, and in the states that do, there is little oversight to confirm that law enforcement officers are receiving the training and applying it correctly. \nAmbiguity in the circumstances surrounding hate crimes can also lead to an undercounting. Under the Hate Crime Statistics Program, law enforcement agencies report the number of hate crimes that were \"motivated in whole or in part by bias.\" Law enforcement officers might have difficulty applying this standard in cases where a bias motivation might not be obvious, especially when considering hate crimes that were motivated \"in part\" by an offender's bias. While a cross burning on the front yard of a black family's home is an unambiguous hate crime, in other cases the motivation of the alleged perpetrators might not be so clear. These ambiguous hate crimes can be classified into two categories: response/retaliation events and target-selection events. \nResponse/retaliation events are those where the offense was first triggered by something other than bias, but at some point bias exacerbates the incident into a hate crime. For example, a white motorist and a black motorist get into a dispute because their cars were involved in an accident. However, after a few minutes, the white motorist assaults the black motorist while yelling racial slurs. In this case, the incident was not initiated because of the white motorist's bias against the black motorist, but the white motorist's bias eventually resulted in him assaulting the black motorist. Target-selection events are those where a target of a crime is selected because of the offender's bias against members of the group, but the offender's bias in not obvious. For example, someone might rob men leaving bars that are known to be frequented by same sex couples because the offender believes they will be less likely to report the offense because they might not want to be identified as being a member of the LGBTQ community.\nIn addition to issues related to law enforcement officer training on identifying hate crimes for submission to the FBI, differences in how a hate crime is defined under state law and under the HCSA can create its own ambiguities. For example, gender identity is a protected class under the HCSA, but it might not be a recognized bias motivation under a state's laws. As such, if a law enforcement officer is more familiar with the state's hate crime definition, he or she might not identify an offense based on gender-bias as a potential hate crime. As one group of researchers noted:\nEven when potential bias crimes are reported to a participating agency, the agency must then recognize any indications of bias, determine whether the incident is bias motivated, document the motivation, and submit the incident to UCR. Empirical evidence suggests that the processing of bias-crime reporting across participating law enforcement agencies is variable and subject to much error and interpretation by local departments.\nImproving Hate Crime Data: Considerations for Policymakers\nCongress passed the HCSA with the intent of collecting national data on bias-motivated offenses that could be used to inform federal hate crime policy. While DOJ has taken steps to collect these data, the hate crime data reported by the FBI is incomplete and the NCVS self-reported hate crime victimization data likely includes incidents that would not meet the legal standard needed to be charged as hate crime. Hate crime data \"missing\" from the FBI's Hate Crime Statistics program results from a series of complications associated with collecting these data (e.g., victims might not report the offense to the police, law enforcement agencies might fail to correctly identify potential hate crimes, or law enforcement agencies might not routinely and systematically report hate crime data to the FBI). Policymakers may have an interest in what steps Congress could take to help improve the quality of the FBI's hate crime data. One option on the horizon might be the wide-scale adoption of the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). \nThe FBI is in the process of phasing out the UCR summary reporting system and having all law enforcement agencies submit data through NIBRS. The FBI reports that it will begin collecting only NIBRS-compliant data from law enforcement agencies starting on January 1, 2021. To support state and local law enforcement agencies' transitions to NIBRS, state and local governments that are not certified as NIBRS compliant have been required since FY2018 to use 3% of their award under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to achieve compliance.\nCompared to the UCR summary reporting system, NIBRS collects more data on a wider variety of offenses. NIBRS asks participating law enforcement agencies to collect and report incident-level data on offenders, victims, the relationship between victims and offenders, and the circumstances surrounding the incident for 52 different offenses. In comparison, the current summary reporting system is largely a tabulation of the number of eight Part I offenses reported to the police.\nAs a part of NIBRS, reporting agencies can identify whether an offense was motivated by an offender's bias against the victim for each reported offense. Under the Hate Crime Statistics Program, law enforcement agencies that are not currently submitting NIBRS-compliant data submit a supplemental summary report to the FBI when there is evidence that one or more crimes in their jurisdiction involved a bias motivation. It has been argued that hate crime reporting will increase as more agencies adopt NIBRS because reporting the presence or absence of bias motivations is built into NIBRS. In addition to making it easier for law enforcement agencies to report hate crimes to the FBI, NIBRS provides data on a wider variety of offenses, including those that were motivated by offenders' bias against their victims, and data on the context of hate crimes (e.g., locations where hate crimes occur, the relationship between alleged perpetrators and victims of hate crimes, whether alleged offenders are residents of the community where they committed their offenses, the weapons used in the offenses (if any), and the types and seriousness of injuries sustained by hate crime victims).\nWhile the FBI might stop accepting crime data from non-NIBRS compliant law enforcement agencies next year, participation in the program is still voluntary. If a law enforcement agency does not believe it is worth the time and effort to adopt NIBRS and the state does not mandate that it participates in the program, there is no federal mandate or incentive for the agency to participate. Therefore, policymakers might have an interest in what steps Congress could take to promote wide-scale adoption of the program. Congress could consider placing a condition on a program such as JAG that would require law enforcement agencies to submit NIBRS data to the FBI or face a penalty under the program. However, the JAG program already provides a financial incentive to participate fully in the FBI's crime reporting program. Half of a state's allocation is based on its proportion of the average number of violent crimes reported in the United States over the past three years, and allocations for local governments are based on their proportion of the average number of violent crimes reported in the state over the past three years. The Bureau of Justice Assistance reports that NIBRS data will be used to calculate JAG awards once NIBRS replaces the summary reporting system. In addition, in order for local governments to be eligible for a direct award under the program, they have to have submitted violent crime data for 3 of the past 10 years. Yet, even with these incentives some law enforcement agencies in the United States do not participate in the UCR because compiling the data can be difficult and time consuming, and many small agencies might not have the resources needed to fully comply with the FBI's data collection and submission requirements. Thus, Congress could also consider authorizing a new grant program that would provide funding to state and local governments to cover expenses related to transitioning to NIBRS, such as purchasing new software and computers, or training officers on how to use NIBRS.\nWhile NIBRS might provide some administrative efficiency with regard to reporting hate crimes, it does not address some of the other issues law enforcement agencies currently have with reporting hate crimes through the UCR program. Implementing NIBRS does not address hate crime victims being reluctant to report an offense to the police, the need for training for law enforcement officers on how to identify potential hate crimes, or the need to improve law enforcement agencies processes for investigating potential hate crimes, nor will it resolve differences between the HCSA and state hate crime definitions.\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

", "response": "\n\nThis report delves into the complexities of hate crime data collection and reporting in the United States, primarily focusing on the Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA). The HCSA, enacted to address the underreporting and lack of national data on hate crimes, mandates the Department of Justice (DOJ) to collect and report data on crimes motivated by prejudice based on various factors like race, religion, sexual orientation, and disability.\n\nThe report highlights the differences between data collected by the FBI (Hate Crime Statistics Program) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (NCVS).  FBI data reflects only hate crimes reported to and confirmed by law enforcement, while NCVS data includes both reported and unreported hate crime victimizations, leading to discrepancies in numbers.\n\nThe report also discusses criticisms regarding the underreporting of hate crimes by law enforcement agencies, citing factors like misclassification errors, victim reluctance to report, and a lack of standardized training for officers in identifying bias-motivated offenses.\n\nThe transition to the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is presented as a potential solution for improving hate crime data accuracy. NIBRS collects more comprehensive data on a wider range of offenses, including bias motivation, which could lead to better identification and reporting of hate crimes.\n\nHowever, the report acknowledges that NIBRS alone cannot solve all the problems associated with hate crime reporting. Addressing issues like victim reluctance, training gaps, and discrepancies between federal and state hate crime definitions remains crucial. The report suggests that Congress could explore additional measures like financial incentives or grants to encourage wider NIBRS adoption and support law enforcement agencies in effectively combating hate crimes.\n\nKey Statistics:\n\n* In 2018, the FBI reported approximately 7,100 hate crime incidents involving 8,800 victims, while the NCVS estimated 198,000 hate crime victimizations in 2017.\n\n* From 1996 to 2017, at least 80% of participating law enforcement agencies reported zero hate crimes.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n* Encourage wider adoption of NIBRS through financial incentives or grant programs.\n\n* Provide funding to support law enforcement agencies in transitioning to NIBRS.\n\n\n* Address issues like victim reluctance, officer training gaps, and discrepancies between federal and state hate crime definitions.\n\nConclusion:\n\nImproving hate crime data collection and reporting is essential for understanding the scope of the problem and developing effective policy responses. While the transition to NIBRS holds promise, it's only one piece of the puzzle.

Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nIntroduction and Issues for Congress\nThe United Kingdom's (UK's) exit from the European Union (EU), commonly termed Brexit , remains the overwhelmingly predominant issue in UK politics. In a national referendum held in June 2016, 52% of UK voters favored leaving the EU. In March 2017, the UK officially notified the EU of its intention to leave the bloc, and the UK and the EU began negotiations on the terms of the UK's withdrawal. Brexit was originally scheduled to occur on March 29, 2019, but the UK Parliament was unable to agree on a way forward due to divisions over what type of Brexit the UK should pursue and challenges related to the future of the border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state). In early 2019, Parliament repeatedly rejected the withdrawal agreement negotiated between then-Prime Minister Theresa May's government and the EU, while also indicating opposition to a no-deal scenario, in which the UK would exit the EU without a negotiated withdrawal agreement. Amid this impasse, in April 2019, EU leaders agreed to grant the UK an extension until October 31, 2019. \nOn October 17, 2019, negotiators from the EU and the government of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson concluded a new withdrawal agreement, but Johnson encountered challenges in securing the UK Parliament's approval of the deal. The EU granted the UK another extension until January 31, 2020, while Parliament set an early general election for December 12, 2019. Johnson's Conservative Party scored a decisive victory in the election, winning 365 out of 650 seats in the UK House of Commons. The result provided Prime Minister Johnson with a mandate to proceed with his preferred plans for Brexit. The UK the EU ratified the withdrawal agreement in January 2020, and the UK withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. Brexit remains far from over, however, as the UK and the EU enter a process of determining the character of their future relationship.\nMany Members of Congress have a broad interest in Brexit. Brexit-related developments are likely to have implications for the global economy, U.S.-UK and U.S.-EU political and economic relations, and transatlantic cooperation on foreign policy and security issues. \nIn 2018, the Administration formally notified Congress under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) of its intent to launch U.S.-UK free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations after the UK leaves the EU, and Congress may consider how Brexit developments affect the prospects for an agreement. Whether a potential final agreement would meet congressional expectations or TPA requirements or be concluded as an executive agreement is unclear.Â Congress would likely need to pass legislation to implement the potential FTA before it could enter into force, particularly if it were a comprehensive FTA. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said that trade negotiations with the UK are a \"priority\" and will start as soon as the UK is in a position to negotiate, but he cautioned that the negotiations may take time.\nSome Members of Congress also have demonstrated an interest in how Brexit might affect Northern Ireland. In April 2019, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there would be \"no chance whatsoever\" for a U.S.-UK trade agreement if Brexit were to weaken the Northern Ireland peace process. On October 22, 2019, the House Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environment held a hearing titled \"Protecting the Good Friday Agreement from Brexit.\" On December 3, 2020, the House passed H.Res. 585 , reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement in light of Brexit and asserting that any future U.S.-UK trade agreement and other U.S.-UK bilateral agreements must include conditions to uphold the peace accord. Other Members of Congress, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, have expressed support for the UK and a bilateral trade agreement post-Brexit and have not conditioned such support on protecting Northern Ireland. \nOverview of Developments\nThe December 2019 election resolved a political deadlock that dominated UK politics for three and a half years. Unable to break the stalemate over Brexit in Parliament, Prime Minister Theresa May resigned as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7, 2019. Boris Johnson became prime minister on July 24, 2019, after winning the resulting Conservative Party leadership contest. Seen as a colorful and polarizing figure who was one of the leading voices in the campaign for the UK to leave the EU, Johnson previously served as UK foreign secretary in the May government from 2016 to 2018 and mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. He inherited a government in which, at the time, the Conservative Party held a one-seat parliamentary majority by virtue of support from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland, which strongly supports Northern Ireland's continued integration as part of the UK. \nAfter taking office, Prime Minister Johnson announced that he intended to negotiate a new deal with the EU that discarded the contentious Northern Ireland backstop provision that would have kept the UK in the EU customs union until the two sides agreed on their future trade relationship. The backstop was intended to prevent a hard border with customs and security checks on the island of Ireland and to ensure that Brexit would not compromise the rules of the EU single market (see Appendix A , which reviews the backstop and the rejected withdrawal deal). Although Prime Minister Johnson asserted that he did not desire a hard land border, he strongly opposed the backstop arrangement. Like many Members of Parliament both within and outside the Conservative Party, Johnson viewed the backstop as potentially curbing the UK's sovereignty and limiting its ability to conclude free trade deals. Given initial skepticism about the chances for renegotiating the withdrawal agreement with the EU, the Johnson government began to ramp up preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.\nIn September 2019, Parliament passed legislation requiring the government to request a three-month deadline extension (through January 31, 2020) from the EU on October 19, 2019, unless the government had reached an agreement with the EU that Parliament had approved or received Parliament's approval to leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement. The government also lost its parliamentary majority in September 2019, with the defection of one Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) to the Liberal Democrats and the expulsion from the party of 21 Conservative MPs (10 of the 21 were later reinstated) who worked with the opposition parties to limit the government's ability to pursue a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Johnson subsequently sought to trigger an early general election, to take place before the October 31 Brexit deadline, but fell short of the needed two-thirds majority in Parliament to support the motion. \nBrexit and Trade\nBrexit and Northern Ireland59\nIn the 2016 Brexit referendum, Northern Ireland voted 56% to 44% against leaving the EU. Brexit poses considerable challenges for Northern Ireland, with potential implications for its peace process, economy, and, in the longer term, constitutional status in the UK. Following Brexit, Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK to share a land border with an EU member state (see Figure 2 ). Preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland (with customs checks and physical infrastructure) was a key goal, and a major stumbling block, in negotiating and finalizing the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU.\nNorthern Ireland's history of political violence complicated arrangements for the post-Brexit border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Roughly 3,500 people died during \"the Troubles,\" Northern Ireland's 30-year sectarian conflict (1969 to 1999) between unionists (Protestants who largely define themselves as British and support remaining part of the UK) and nationalists (Catholics who consider themselves Irish and may desire a united Ireland). At the time of the 1998 peace accord in Northern Ireland (known as the Good Friday Agreement or the Belfast Agreement), the EU membership of both the UK and the Republic of Ireland was regarded as essential to underpinning the political settlement by providing a common European identity for both unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland. EU law also provided a supporting framework for guaranteeing the human rights, equality, and nondiscrimination provisions of the peace accord.\nSince 1998, as security checkpoints were dismantled in accordance with the peace agreement, and because both the UK and Ireland belonged to the EU's single market and customs union, the circuitous 300-mile land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland effectively disappeared. The border's disappearance served as an important political and psychological symbol on both sides of the sectarian divide and helped produce a dynamic cross-border economy. Many experts deem an open, invisible border as crucial to a still-fragile peace process, in which deep divisions and a lack of trust persist. Some analysts suggest that differences over Brexit also heightened tensions between the unionist and nationalist communities' respective political parties and stymied the reestablishment of the regional (or devolved) government for close to three years following the last legislative assembly elections in March 2017. (For more background, see Appendix B .) \nImplications for U.S.-UK Relations\nMany U.S. officials and Members of Congress view the UK as the United States' closest and most reliable ally. This perception stems from a combination of factors, including a sense of shared history, values, and culture; a large and mutually beneficial economic relationship; and extensive cooperation on foreign policy and security issues. The UK and the United States have a particularly close defense relationship and a unique intelligence-sharing partnership. \nSince 2016, President Trump has been outspoken in repeatedly expressing his support for Brexit. President Trump counts leading Brexit supporters, including Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, among his personal friends. He publicly criticized Theresa May's handling of Brexit and stated during the most recent Conservative leadership race that Boris Johnson would \"make a great prime minister.\" President Trump repeated his support for Johnson prior to the December 2019 UK election and celebrated Johnson's win, writing on social media that the election outcome would allow the United States and UK to reach a new trade deal.\nSenior Administration officials have reinforced the President's pro-Brexit messages. During an August 2019 visit to London, then-U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton stated that the Administration would \"enthusiastically\" support a no-deal Brexit; he asserted that a U.S.-UK trade deal could be negotiated quickly and possibly be concluded sector-by-sector to speed up the process. In a September 2019 visit to Ireland, Vice President Mike Pence reiterated the Administration's support for the UK leaving the EU and urged Ireland and the EU to \"work to reach an agreement that respects the United Kingdom's sovereignty.\" Vice President Pence expressed his hope that an agreement would \"also provide for an orderly Brexit.\"\nConclusion\nThree and a half years after the Brexit referendum, a decisive victory in the UK's December 2019 general election allowed UK Prime Minister Johnson to proceed with Brexit. The UK withdrew from the EU at the end of January 2020 and began a transition period, scheduled to last until the end of 2020, during which it is expected to focus on negotiations with the EU on an FTA and other elements of the future UK-EU relationship. A significant number of unknowns remain, including how elements of the withdrawal agreement will be implemented, whether the two sides will be able to conclude an agreement on the future relationship during the 11-month transition period, and the effects of ending the transition period without such an agreement. Regardless of the precise turn of events, the aftermath of Brexit is expected to remain a primary focus of UK politics and a leading concern for the EU for the foreseeable future.\nDuring the 116 th Congress, developments with regard to Brexit and their implications for U.S.-UK and U.S.-EU relations, foreign policy and security cooperation, and the global economy and trade issues may remain of interest to Members of Congress. The topic of a prospective U.S.-UK FTA may be a particular area of congressional interest. Congress also may consider how Brexit could affect Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland peace process. \nAppendix A. Review of the Backstop and the Rejected Withdrawal Deal\nUnder former United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Theresa May, the approach of the UK government to leaving the European Union (EU) was to pursue a relatively hard Brexit , meaning a full departure from the EU single market and customs union, and a full restoration of British sovereignty over lawmaking, including with regard to controlling immigration. The approach called for the UK to subsequently negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU to secure as much access to the EU market as possible. \nIn November 2018, EU and UK negotiators finalized a 585-page draft withdrawal agreement and a 26-page political declaration on the future relationship. The withdrawal agreement contained four main elements to guide the UK's orderly departure from the EU: \nGuarantees pertaining to the rights of the approximately 3 million EU citizens residing in the UK and the approximately 1 million UK citizens residing in the EU. A commitment by the UK to pay the EU Â£39 billion (approximately $50 billion) to settle outstanding budgetary and financial pledges. A transition period, lasting through 2020, in which the UK would be bound to follow all rules governing the EU single market while the two sides negotiate their future relationship and implement steps needed to effect an orderly separation. A backstop provision, which would keep the UK in the EU customs union until the two sides agreed on their future trade relationship. The backstop was made necessary by the lack of an apparent solution to the Irish border question, with both sides intent on avoiding a hard border with customs checks and physical infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The provision was intended to protect cross-border trade and preserve the peace process between parties to Northern Ireland's long sectarian conflict. The EU also viewed the backstop as necessary to ensure that Brexit would not violate the rules and structure of the EU single market.\nThe nonbinding political declaration on the future UK-EU relationship called for an economic partnership with the EU that features an ambitious free trade area and deep cooperation, but also \"separate markets and distinct legal orders,\" and the development of an independent UK trade policy. \nThe backstop provision became one of the main obstacles to securing Parliament's approval of the withdrawal agreement. Although the former May government contended that it would never be necessary to implement the backstop, critics noted that the UK would be unable to conduct an independent national trade policy, one of the main selling points for Brexit's supporters, as long as the UK remained a member of the EU customs union. (The backstop would have taken effect at the conclusion of the transition periodâthat is, at the end of 2020âif the two sides had not reached a new trade agreement with more preferable arrangements for resolving the border issue.) \nSupporters of a hard Brexit, led by a faction of the Conservative Party, objected that the backstop would leave the UK a \"vassal state\" of the EU, bound indefinitely to many EU rules (both sides would have to jointly agree to end the backstop). Many unionists in Northern Ireland strongly opposed the deal because a provision in the backstop would preserve deeper regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU to avoid a hard border. They argue that it is unacceptable to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK and that doing so weakens the UK's constitutional integrity. \nAdvocates of a soft Brexit maintain that permanent membership in the EU single market would be the least damaging outcome in economic terms, and that an assurance of permanent customs union membership would mitigate Brexit-related uncertainties. Many who favor a soft Brexit argued that May's withdrawal agreement prolonged such uncertainties while failing to deliver sufficient benefits. Others in the opposition parties voted against the deal in the hopes that its defeat would lead to an early general election or a second referendum on EU membership. \nBetween January 2019 and March 2019, the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement three times. The House of Commons also held a series of nonbinding \"indicative\" votes to determine where Members stood on options and proposals, including staying in the EU single market and/or customs union, leaving without a deal, cancelling the withdrawal process to avoid \"no deal,\" and holding a public vote to confirm any deal. No proposal received a majority. \nAppendix B. Northern Ireland: From the Troubles to a Fragile Peace\nBetween 1969 and 1999, roughly 3,500 people died as a result of political violence in Northern Ireland. The conflict, often referred to as \"the Troubles,\" has its origins in the 1921 division of Ireland and reflects a struggle between different national, cultural, and religious identities. Protestants in Northern Ireland (48%) largely define themselves as British and support remaining part of the United Kingdom ( unionists ). Catholics in Northern Ireland (45%) consider themselves Irish, and many Catholics desire a united Ireland ( nationalists ). In the past, more militant unionists ( loyalists ) and more militant nationalists ( republicans ) were willing to use violence to achieve their goals.\nThe 1998 Peace Agreement\nFor years, the British and Irish governments sought to facilitate a negotiated political settlement to the conflict. After many ups and downs, the two governments and the Northern Ireland political parties participating in peace talks announced an agreement on April 10, 1998. The resulting Good Friday Agreementâor Belfast Agreementâis a multi-layered and interlocking document, consisting of a political settlement reached by Northern Ireland's political parties and an international treaty between the UK and Irish governments. \nAt the core of the Good Friday Agreement is the consent principle âthat is, a change in Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom (UK) can come about only with the consent of the majority of Northern Ireland's people (as well as with the consent of a majority in Ireland). Although the agreement acknowledged that a substantial section of the population in Northern Ireland and a majority on the island desired a united Ireland, it recognized that the majority of people in Northern Ireland wished to remain part of the UK. If the preferences of these majorities were to change, the agreement asserted that both the UK and Irish governments would have a binding obligation to bring about the wish of the people; thus, the agreement included provisions for future polls (a border poll ) to be held in Northern Ireland on its constitutional status should events warrant.\nThe Good Friday Agreement set out a framework for devolved governmentâthe transfer of specified powers over local governance from London to Belfastâwith a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee in which unionist and nationalist parties would share power. The agreement also contained provisions on the decommissioning (disarmament) of paramilitary weapons, policing, human rights, UK security normalization (demilitarization) in Northern Ireland, and the status of prisoners. Finally, the Good Friday Agreement created several new institutions to promote \"north-south\" cooperation on cross-border issues among leaders on the island of Ireland and \"east-west\" institutions to address regional issues affecting the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man.\nDespite a much-improved security situation since 1998, full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has been challenging. For years, instability in Northern Ireland's devolved government was the rule rather than the exception. Decommissioning and police reforms were key sticking points. In 2007, however, the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein, the political party associated with the Irish Republican Army (IRA), reached a landmark power-sharing deal. Regularly scheduled Assembly elections since the 2007 deal (in 2011 and 2016) produced successive power-sharing governments led by the DUP and Sinn Fein. In 2010, the DUP and Sinn Fein also reached an agreement to resolve the controversial issue of devolving police and justice affairs from London to Belfast.\nRecent Crisis in the Devolved Government and Other Challenges\nAnalysts largely view implementation of the most important aspects of the Good Friday Agreement as complete. At the same time, tensions and distrust persist among the unionist and nationalist communities and their respective political parties, and many experts suggest that the peace process remains fragile. The inability of Northern Ireland's political parties to reach an agreement on reestablishing a devolved government for nearly three years following snap 2017 Assembly elections exemplifies the ongoing divisions and frictions in Northern Ireland's politics and society.\nThe previous devolved government led by the DUP and Sinn Fein collapsed in January 2017, after 10 months in office. The immediate impetus for the collapse was a renewable energy scandal involving DUP leader and Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster. However, frictions on several other issuesâincluding giving the Irish language the same official status as English, legalizing same-sex marriage, and Brexitâcontributed to Sinn Fein's decision to force snap Assembly elections. The DUP and Sinn Fein remain at odds over Brexit; Sinn Fein strongly opposes Brexit, whereas the DUP is the only major Northern Ireland political party to support it. The DUP retained the largest number of Assembly seats in the March 2017 elections, but Sinn Fein reduced the gap with the DUP to one seat in the Assembly and was widely regarded as the biggest winner.\nNegotiations on forming a new devolved government proceeded in fits and starts but repeatedly stalled, primarily over a potential stand-alone Irish Language Act. Some analysts suggest that the DUP's support for the Conservative Party government in the UK Parliament following the June 2017 snap general election further heightened distrust between Sinn Fein and the DUP, hardened the positions of both parties, and made reaching an agreement on a new devolved government more difficult. Others note that Brexit has consumed UK and Northern Ireland politicians' time and attention and largely overshadowed negotiations on a new devolved government.\nIn April 2019, journalist Lyra McKee was shot and killed while covering riots in Londonderry (also known as Derry). The New IRA, a dissident republican group opposed to the peace process, claimed responsibility (but also apologized, asserting that it had been aiming to shoot a police officer but hit McKee by accident). McKee's death sparked a significant public outcry and prompted the UK and Irish governments to launch a more intensive effort to revive talks with Northern Ireland's political parties on forming a new devolved government. Negotiations remained largely deadlocked, however, throughout the summer and fall of 2019 amid ongoing uncertainty over Brexit.\nOn December 16, 2019, the UK and Irish governments launched a new round of talks with the DUP, Sinn Fein, and Northern Ireland's other main political parties aimed at reestablishing the devolved government. These negotiations followed the UK's December 12, 2019, general election in which Prime Minister Johnson's Conservative Party won a convincing parliamentary majority, negating the influence of the DUP in the UK Parliament and clearing the way for approval of the Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU. Some analysts suggested the UK election results improved the prospects for restoring Northern Ireland's devolved government. Both the DUP and Sinn Fein saw a decrease in their shares of the vote, while more moderate \"middle ground\" parties saw an increase, in part due to voter dissatisfaction with the impasse in reestablishing the devolved government.\nOn January 10, 2020, the DUP and Sinn Fein agreed to a deal to restore devolved government put forward by the UK and Irish governments. The new Assembly convened the following day and elected a new Executive, including the DUP's Arlene Foster as First Minister and Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill as Deputy First Minister. The power-sharing deal is wide-ranging and addresses a number of key issues, including use of the Irish language, health and education concerns, increasing the number of police officers, and measures to improve the sustainability and transparency of Northern Ireland's political institutions. Both the UK and Irish governments also promised additional financial support for Northern Ireland as part of the deal.\nDespite the decrease in the levels of violence since the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland continues to grapple with a number of issues in its search for peace and reconciliation. Northern Ireland remains a largely divided society, with Protestant and Catholic communities existing in parallel. Around 100 peace walls or other physical barriers throughout Northern Ireland separate some Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods, and schools and housing estates remain mostly single-identity communities. Sectarian tensions continue to flare periodically on issues such as parading, protests, and the use of flags and emblems. Other prominent challenges include addressing Northern Ireland's legacy of violence (often termed dealing with the past ), curbing remaining paramilitary and dissident activity, and promoting economic development and equality. Experts also contend that Brexit may continue to pose significant concerns for Northern Ireland's still-tenuous peace process and its future political and economic development. \n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_061", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nLetter\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, foreign direct investment  contributed over $4 trillion to the U.S. economy in fiscal year 2017. One  source of foreign direct investment is from foreign nationals of 82  countries (treaty countries) who may obtain E-2 nonimmigrant status in  the United States. The E-2 nonimmigrant classification allows a foreign  national of a treaty country (investor) to be temporarily admitted to the  United States solely to develop and direct the operations of a U.S.  business in which he or she has invested a substantial amount of capital.  E-2 status may also be available to other individuals who share the  investor’s treaty country nationality and are working for the business,  such as an employee in an executive or supervisory position (manager)  or an employee having special qualifications essential to successful or  efficient business operations (essential employee). Furthermore, the  spouse and children (dependents) of an E-2 investor, manager, or  essential employee are also eligible for E-2 status.\nThere are two pathways for an individual to obtain E-2 status: (1) by  applying through the Department of State (State) for an E-2 visa at a U.S.  embassy or consulate abroad (posts) and then being inspected and  admitted at a U.S. port of entry by the Department of Homeland Security’s  (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or (2) if already in the  United States in E-2 or another nonimmigrant status (e.g., business visitor  or student), by petitioning for a change to, or extension of, E-2 status  through DHS’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). As  with other immigration benefits, State consular officers and USCIS  immigration officers are tasked with ensuring that E-2 status is not  granted to ineligible individuals, including those engaging in fraud, such  as using counterfeit identity documents or making false claims material to  the adjudication process. Additionally, CBP is responsible for inspecting  all E-2 visa holders at U.S. ports of entry to determine their admissibility  for an authorized period of stay.\nConsistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), prospective E-2  nonimmigrants must meet several eligibility requirements. For example,  the E-2 investor, manager, and essential employee must be a national of  a country with which the United States maintains treaties of commerce  and navigation. Further, although there is no prescribed minimum  investment amount, the investor must place a “substantial” amount of  capital “at risk” (i.e., subject to total or partial loss).\nYou asked us to review State’s and USCIS’s oversight and  implementation of the E-2 adjudication process. This report examines (1)  the outcomes and characteristics of foreign nationals who have sought or  received E-2 status during fiscal years 2014 through 2018, (2) State and  USCIS policies and procedures to ensure that individuals meet E-2  eligibility requirements, and (3) State and USCIS efforts to assess and  address potential fraud in the E-2 adjudication process.\nTo determine the outcomes and characteristics of foreign nationals who  have sought or received E-2 status, we analyzed data from State’s  Bureau of Consular Affairs and USCIS on E-2 visa applications and  petitions adjudicated from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. To assess the  reliability of the E-2 data, we interviewed State and USCIS officials who  maintain the data and checked the data for missing information, outliers,  and obvious errors, among other actions. On the basis of these steps, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives, including providing summary statistics on E-2  adjudications, outcomes, and the characteristics of those seeking E-2  status. We also analyzed generalizable stratified random samples of E-2  visa applications from State and E-2 petitions from USCIS adjudicated in  fiscal year 2018 to gather additional information, such as information on  types of businesses and investment amounts. Specifically, we reviewed  120 E-2 visa applications and 124 E-2 petitions from USCIS for E-2  investors, managers, and essential employees. We chose sample sizes  to achieve precision levels for a percentage estimate of plus or minus 10  percentage points for important sub-populations, such as denied petitions  and role (e.g., investor, manager, and essential employee).\nTo assess State and USCIS policies and procedures to ensure that  individuals meet E-2 eligibility requirements, we reviewed relevant  provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and implementing  regulations, and State and USCIS guidance, such as State’s Foreign  Affairs Manual (FAM) and USCIS’s E-2 standard operating procedures.  We also interviewed officials from State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs and  Foreign Service Institute, and USCIS on their respective agencies’ E-2  processes and procedures, as well as training. Further, we assessed  State’s and USCIS’s policies and procedures for ensuring that individuals  meet E-2 eligibility requirements against control environment, control  activities, and monitoring internal control standards in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, as well as documentation  retention requirements in agency guidance.\nE-2 Adjudication Definitions  Prescreening: The review of a visa  application by consular officers and locally  employed staff prior to the applicant’s  interview. It can include processing steps,  such as reviewing applicant documentation for  completeness, as well as more analytical  tasks, such as developing interview questions  and summary notes and conducting research  on the applicant and business using available  databases and resources. However, only  consular officers can adjudicate visa  applications.\nWe conducted site visits to State and USCIS locations that adjudicate E-2  visa applications and petitions, respectively. For State, we conducted site  visits from October through December 2018. For our site visits, we  selected four posts that (1) were among the 10 highest E-2 adjudicating  posts by volume in fiscal year 2017, (2) had different staffing models for  E-2 visa adjudications, and (3) were geographically dispersed. During  these visits, we observed the processing, prescreening (see sidebar), and  adjudication of E-2 applications, and interviewed consular officials and  locally employed staff (LES), among others, about E-2 visa adjudication  policies, procedures, resources, and training. Our observations from  these site visits provided useful insights into State’s E-2 adjudication  procedures, but are not generalizable to all posts that adjudicate E-2  visas. For USCIS, in November 2018, we visited the California Service  Center in Laguna Niguel, California—which is the only USCIS service  center that adjudicates E-2 petitions—to observe E-2 adjudications and  interview USCIS officials. In addition to our site visits, we conducted  telephone interviews with State consular officers and LES responsible for  prescreening and adjudicating E-2 visa applications at the remaining 6 of  the top 10 posts in terms of E-2 annual adjudications, as well as 4  randomly selected low-volume posts. Further, we reviewed written  responses from consular managers at these 14 posts to a set of  questions regarding E-2 adjudication processes and procedures,  challenges, E-2 company registration programs, and E-2 training.\nE-2 Adjudication Definitions  E-2 fraud: E-2 fraud is a type of immigration  benefit fraud that involves the willful or  knowing misrepresentation of material facts  for the purpose of obtaining E-2 nonimmigrant  status, for which the person committing fraud  is therefore ineligible. Such  misrepresentations may involve a specific  intent to deceive. Immigration benefit fraud is  often facilitated by document fraud and  identity fraud. Immigration-related document  fraud includes forging, counterfeiting, altering,  or falsely making any document, or using,  possessing, obtaining, accepting, or receiving  such falsified documents in order to satisfy  any requirement of, or to obtain a benefit  under the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Identity fraud refers to the fraudulent use of  others’ valid documents.\nTo determine the efforts that State and USCIS take to assess and  address potential E-2 fraud, we reviewed relevant State and USCIS   standard operating procedures and guidance. We interviewed  headquarters officials from State and USCIS, including those from State’s  Fraud Prevention Program and USCIS’s Fraud Detection and National  Security Directorate, on how both agencies identify and address potential  E-2 fraud and what, if any, coordination or information sharing occurs  between State and USCIS. During our four site visits abroad, we  interviewed officials, such as State’s fraud prevention managers and  assistant regional security officer-investigators (ARSO-I), on anti-fraud  efforts for E-2 visas at their posts, including potential fraud trends.  Similarly, we interviewed immigration officers at USCIS’s California  Service Center on their anti-fraud efforts for E-2 petitions. We obtained  data from State and USCIS on fraud referrals—that is, cases sent to fraud  experts for additional research and review—and the results of fraud site  visits from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. To assess the reliability of  these data, we interviewed State and USCIS officials who maintain the  data and checked the data for missing information, outliers, and obvious errors. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to provide  summary statistics on fraud referrals and the results of fraud site visits.  Further, we assessed State’s and USCIS’s anti-fraud efforts against best  practices for fraud coordination found in A Framework for Managing  Fraud Risks in Federal Programs. Additional details regarding our  objectives, scope, and methodology are provided in appendix I.\nWe conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\nThis report reviews the Department of State’s (State) and Homeland  Security’s (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (USCIS)  oversight and implementation of E-2 adjudications. Specifically, this report  examines (1) the outcomes and characteristics of foreign nationals who  have sought or received E-2 status during fiscal years 2014 through  2018, (2) State’s and USCIS’s policies and procedures to ensure that  individuals meet E-2 eligibility requirements, and (3) State’s and USCIS’s  efforts to assess and address potential fraud in the E-2 adjudication  process.\nTo determine the outcomes and characteristics of foreign nationals who  have sought or received E-2 status, we analyzed data from State’s  Bureau of Consular Affairs and USCIS on E-2 visa applications and  petitions adjudicated from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. For example,  the data we analyzed included E-2 role (e.g., investor, manager, essential  employee, and dependents), adjudication outcome (i.e., issued or  refused), and nationality, among other data points. To assess the  reliability of the E-2 data, we interviewed State and USCIS officials that  maintain the data and checked the data for missing information, outliers,  and obvious errors, among other actions. For example, we identified and  removed duplicate entries in State’s data. On the basis of these steps,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives, including providing summary statistics on E-2  adjudications, outcomes, and the characteristics of those seeking E-2  status.\nTo obtain additional data points, such as types of business and  investment amount, we analyzed generalizable stratified random samples  of E-2 visa applications and petitions adjudicated in fiscal year 2018.  Specifically, we reviewed 124 E-2 petitions from USCIS and 120 State  applications for E-2 investors, managers, and essential employees. The  documents in our file review included, for example, State’s DS-160 online  nonimmigrant visa application and DS-156E supplemental application,  USCIS’s I-129 petition for nonimmigrant workers, and supporting  documents, when available. To collect information from the applications  and petitions, we created a data collection instrument and established  standard procedures to ensure that we accurately collected the  information from the original forms. We chose sample sizes to achieve  precision levels for a percentage estimate of plus or minus 10 percentage  points for important sub-populations, such as denied petitions and role  (e.g., investor, manager, and essential employee). As a result, all  percentage estimates presented in this report have a precision of plus or  minus 10 percentage points or fewer, unless otherwise noted. Further, we  classified the types of businesses in the applications and petitions using  the North American Industry Classification System by conducting a  content analysis of the business description field in the applications and  petitions to group related business types into larger groups, such a food  service and manufacturing.\nFurther, we also collected and analyzed data and information from USCIS  and U.S. Customs and Border Protection on post E-2 adjudication  outcomes, including changing status from E-2 to another nonimmigrant  category, adjusting from E-2 status to lawful permanent residency, and E- 2 nonimmigrants who remain in the United States beyond the expiration  of their authorized period of stay, known as overstays.  We present the  results of this analysis in Appendix III. To assess the reliability of these  data, we interviewed officials that maintain the data and checked the data  for missing information, outliers, and obvious errors, among other actions.  On the basis of these steps, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of providing summary statistics on E-2 post  adjudication outcomes.\nTo assess State and USCIS policies and procedures to ensure that  individuals meet E-2 eligibility requirements, we reviewed relevant State  and USCIS guidance documentation, including State’s Foreign Affairs  Manual and USCIS’s E-2 standard operating procedures. We also  reviewed relevant provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and  implementing regulations, which set forth the E-2 eligibility requirements.  We interviewed officials from State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs and  Foreign Service Institute, and USCIS on their respective agencies’ E-2  processes and procedures, as well as training provided to State’s  consular officers and USCIS’s immigration officers. Further, we assessed  State’s and USCIS’s policies and procedures to ensure that individuals  meet E-2 eligibility requirements against control environment, control  activities, and monitoring internal control standards in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, as well as documentation  retention requirements in agency guidance.\nWe conducted site visits to State and USCIS locations that adjudicate E-2  visas and petitions, respectively. For State, we conducted site visits to  four posts abroad—London, United Kingdom; Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo,  Japan; and Toronto, Canada from October through December 2018. For  our site visits, we selected posts that (1) were among the 10 highest E-2  adjudicating posts by volume in fiscal year 2017, (2) had different staffing  models for processing E-2 visa adjudications, such as posts that had a  single officer specializing in E-2 visas or posts that had all consular  officers adjudicate E-2 visas, and (3) were geographically dispersed.  During these visits, we observed the prescreening and adjudication of E-2  applications and used a data collection instrument to collect information  on the cases we observed, such as adjudication outcome and other non- personally identifiable information about the case. We interviewed  consular officers and managers, locally employed staff (LES), fraud  prevention managers, and the assistant regional security officer- investigators (ARSO-I), where available, about topics such as E-2 visa  adjudication policies, procedures, resources and training available at  post. Our observations from these site visits provided useful insights into  State’s E-2 adjudication procedures, but are not generalizable to all posts  that adjudicate E-2 visas. For USCIS, in November 2018, we visited the  California Service Center in Laguna Niguel, California—which is the only  USCIS service center that adjudicates E-2 petitions—to observe E-2  petition adjudications and interview USCIS officials.\nIn addition to our site visits, we conducted telephonic interviews with  consular officers and LES who are responsible for prescreening and  adjudicating E-2 visa applications at the remaining six of the top 10 posts  in terms of E-2 annual adjudications, as well as four randomly selected  low-volume posts. The 4 low-volume posts were selected at random  from a list of posts that had adjudicated at least 100 E-2 visa applications  in fiscal year 2017. We collected copies of post-specific standard  operating procedures and local E-2 visa adjudication tools (e.g.,  checklists), as available, from the 14 posts we visited or interviewed.  Further, we reviewed written responses from the consular managers  responsible for supervising E-2 visa adjudications at these 14 posts to a  set of questions regarding E-2 adjudication processes and procedures,  challenges, E-2 company registration programs, and E-2 training.\nTo determine the efforts that State and USCIS take to assess and  address E-2 fraud, we reviewed relevant State and USCIS standard  operating procedures and guidance. We interviewed headquarters  officials from State and USCIS, such as State’s Office of Fraud  Prevention Program and USCIS’s Fraud Detection and National Security  Directorate, on how both agencies identify and address potential E-2  fraud and what, if any, coordination or information sharing occur between  State and USCIS. During our 4 site visits abroad, we interviewed officials,  such as fraud prevention managers and ARSO-Is, on anti-fraud efforts for  E-2 visas at their posts, including potential fraud trends. Similarly, we  interviewed immigration officers at USCIS’s California Service Center on  their anti-fraud efforts for E-2 petitions.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix II: List of Treaty Countries Eligible for E-2 Status\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act requires the existence of a qualifying  treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and a  foreign state in order for E-2 visa classification to be accorded to  nationals of that foreign state. According to Department of State  guidance, such qualifying treaties may include treaties of friendship,  commerce and navigation, and bilateral investment treaties. As of June  2019, nationals of the 82 countries listed in Table 7 may be accorded E-2  status pursuant to a qualifying treaty, or pursuant to legislation enacted to  extend that same privilege.\nAppendix III: E-2 Adjudication Statistics\nThis appendix presents various statistics on adjudications by State for E-2  visas as well as those by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  (USCIS) for E-2 petitions for fiscal years 2014 through 2018. We present  these data broken out by fiscal year, outcome (e.g., issued or refused),  type (e.g., investor, manager, essential employee, dependent), country of  nationality or birth, reason for refusal, and prior nonimmigrant status, if  available. Further, we also provide statistics on some post-adjudication  outcomes—that is, data on characteristics of those who obtained E-2  status. These outcomes include changes to another nonimmigrant status  or lawful permanent residency, or the extent to which E-2 status holders  remained in the United States beyond their authorized period of stay,  known as overstaying.\nAppendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security\nAppendix V: Comments from the Department of State\nAppendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\nProject Manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\nIndustrial Designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\nProject Manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Why are you looking at me ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .\nProject Manager: Oh , yeah ,\nMarketing: Right , okay .\nProject Manager: p put them in pockets .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay .\nProject Manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .\nMarketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: so um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: It's got no eyes .\nMarketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .\nUser Interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?\nMarketing: I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .

Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .\nProject Manager: There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .\nUser Interface: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: mm {vocalsound} hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's not bad at all .\nProject Manager: Ah it looks like a dog .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep .\nMarketing: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side .\nUser Interface: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: And where where are you from ?\nUser Interface: I'm from Estonia\nProject Manager: Estonia .\nUser Interface: uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles ,\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Good luck .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that'll do .\nMarketing: and then just some horns .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so let let me draw the body first .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and they've got a long tail\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: and a long face . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's eating .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And there is some grass there .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Horns ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass ,\nMarketing: draw some horns . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they do not disturb anybody um\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , here's a space .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It looks very very cute .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I like the cow .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: I'm Jen .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I like {disfmarker} Mm .\nMarketing: Is that a lizard ?\nIndustrial Designer: No way . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Wow .\nProject Manager: It's a gecko .\nIndustrial Designer: Ah okay .\nUser Interface: Ah , a gecko , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Is there a difference ?\nUser Interface: Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard .\nUser Interface: yeah , they are\nProject Manager: And I I like geckos\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nUser Interface: Ah . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?\nProject Manager: I don't like snakes . I come from Australia\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\nUser Interface: Wonderful .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I've just thought {disfmarker}\nMarketing: If you right click on it you can {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally {vocalsound} as {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got {disfmarker} um we're planning to sell these remote controls for {disfmarker} let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\nUser Interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\nProject Manager: Something something new .\nMarketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: But what do most people do ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\nMarketing: Sometimes they play a movie .\nIndustrial Designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , so\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that ,\nProject Manager: So , no .\nMarketing: maybe to do {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And then use the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nProject Manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .\nMarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah .\nUser Interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Hm-hmm .\nProject Manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright .\nProject Manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that .\nUser Interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you .\nProject Manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} See you .\nProject Manager: Carry the laptops back again .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably . \n[Text End]\n[Requirements]:\n1. Capture the key topics discussed.\n2. Maintain the original meaning and context of the dialog.\n3.

{"id": "summarization_066", "instruction": "You're a professional researcher. Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \ncurrent theoretical models of structure formation in the universe are based on the paradigm of gravitational instability .\nthis process is believed to be responsible for driving the growth of small primordial density perturbations into the nonlinear collapsed structures such as galaxies and clusters that are evident in the universe today .\nthe premise of gravitational instability has been tested indirectly by comparing the clustering predicted by numerical simulations of the formation of cosmic structures with the observed distribution of galaxies ( e.g. benson et al .\na direct test of this fundamental ingredient of structure formation models was made using the 2dfgrs by peacock et al .\nthe size of the 2dfgrs allowed the first accurate measurement of the two - point galaxy correlation function on large scales .\npeacock et al . demonstrated that the two - point correlation function at large pair separations displays a form that is characteristic of the bulk motions of galaxies expected in the gravitational instability scenario .\nwe present an independent test of the gravitational instability paradigm . for a gaussian distribution of density fluctuations , the volume averaged correlation functions , @xmath7 , are identically zero for @xmath8 ; the density field is completely described by its variance , @xmath9 .\nthe evolution of an initially gaussian density field due to gravitational instability generates non - zero @xmath7 ( peebles 1980 ) .\na basic test of the gravitational origin of the higher order moments is to determine their relation to the variance of the distribution .\nthis is traditionally encapsulated in the hierarchical model : @xmath10 this model applies to real space clustering ; however , in redshift space the scaling still tends to hold even on small scales where the `` fingers - of - god '' effect is prominent ( lahav et al . 1993 ; hoyle , szapudi & baugh 2000 ) .\nperturbation theory predicts that the hierarchical amplitudes for the mass distribution are independent of the cosmological density parameter , the cosmological constant and cosmic epoch ( bernardeau et al . 2002 ) .\nwe use the 2dfgrs ( colless et al .\n2001 , 2003 ) to measure the higher order correlation functions of the galaxy distribution , focusing on the clustering of @xmath1 galaxies .\nthe size of the 2dfgrs is exploited to extract a volume limited sample of @xmath1 galaxies , which greatly simplifies our analysis ( section 2 ) .\nthe results for the volume averaged correlation functions , up to sixth order , are presented in section 3 , in which we also test how well the hierarchical scaling model works .\nour conclusions are given in section 4 .\nthe density of galaxies is a strong function of radial distance in a magnitude limited survey .\nthis needs to be compensated for in any clustering analysis by applying a suitable weighting scheme ( e.g. saunders et al .\nalternatively , one may construct a volume limited sample by selecting certain galaxies from the full redshift survey .\nthese galaxies are chosen so that they would appear inside the apparent magnitude range of the survey if displaced to any redshift within the interval defining the sample .\nthe only radial variation in galaxy number density in a volume limited sample is due to large scale structure in the galaxy distribution .\nthis makes volume limited samples much more straightforward to analyse than flux limited samples .\nhowever , only a fraction of the galaxies from the full redshift survey satisfy the selection criteria in redshift and absolute magnitude .\nthis reduction in the density of galaxies has curtailed the utility of volume limited subsamples constructed from earlier redshift surveys .\nwe construct a volume limited sample of @xmath1 galaxies from the 2dfgrs .\nthe motivation for the choice of a sample centred on @xmath1 is clear ; this results in a volume limited sample with the largest possible number of galaxies for magnitude bins of a given size .\nas the luminosity used to define a sample increases , the selected galaxies can be seen out to larger redshifts and thus sample larger volumes .\nhowever , brighter than @xmath1 , the space density of galaxies drops exponentially ( e.g. norberg et al . 2002 ) .\nhence , the optimum balance between volume surveyed and intrinsic galaxy space density is achieved for @xmath1 galaxies .\nin addition , the higher order clustering of @xmath1 galaxies provides a benchmark or reference against which to compare trends in clustering strength with galaxy luminosity ( see norberg et al 2001 ; croton et al .\nwe consider the two contiguous areas of the 2dfgrs , referred to as the ngp and sgp regions , which contain around 190,000 galaxies with redshifts and cover an effective area of approximately 1200 square degrees in total . after selecting galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath11 ( corrected to @xmath12 using the global @xmath13 correction quoted by norberg et al .\n2002 ) , the volume limited sample contains 44,931 galaxies .\nthe redshift interval of the sample is @xmath14 to @xmath15 , corresponding to a volume of @xmath16 for the combined ngp and sgp regions .\nthe distribution of counts in cells is estimated by throwing down a large number of spherical cells , on the order of @xmath17 for each cell radius considered , within the @xmath1 volume limited 2dfgrs sample .\nfull details of how we deal with the spectroscopic incompleteness and the angular mask are given in croton et al .\n( 2004a ) ; the corrections turn out to be small in any case ( see figure 1 of croton et al . ) .\nthe higher order correlation functions , @xmath7 , are the reduced @xmath18 order moments of the distribution of galaxy counts in cells .\nthe estimation of the higher order correlation functions from the cell count probability distribution is explained in a number of papers ( e.g. gaztaaga 1994 ;

", "response": "\n\nThis paper investigates the validity of the gravitational instability paradigm as the primary driver of structure formation in the universe.  Using a volume-limited sample of 44,931 galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the range -19 to -21 from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), the researchers analyze the higher-order correlation functions (up to sixth order) of these galaxies to test the hierarchical scaling relation predicted by gravitational instability models.\n\nThe hierarchical model predicts a specific relationship between the higher-order correlation functions and the variance of the galaxy distribution. This relationship is tested by comparing the measured correlation functions to predictions derived from the ΛCDM Hubble Volume simulation, which provides a theoretical model for the distribution of dark matter in the universe.\n\nThe study's key finding is that the measured higher-order correlation functions of galaxies strongly support the hierarchical scaling relation, confirming the validity of the gravitational instability paradigm as a fundamental mechanism for structure formation. This agreement is found over a wide range of scales, extending to smaller scales than those where perturbation theory predictions are reliable. The authors further note that the variance of the galaxy distribution closely aligns with the predictions from the ΛCDM simulation, reinforcing the notion that galaxies trace the underlying dark matter distribution on large scales.\n\n\nHowever, the study reveals some discrepancies on smaller scales (below ~6 Mpc). The observed higher-order correlation functions for galaxies are lower than those predicted by the ΛCDM simulation on these scales, suggesting that the simple linear bias model, which assumes a direct proportionality between galaxy distribution and dark matter distribution, may not fully capture the complexity of the relationship between them. This discrepancy hints at the potential importance of non-linear bias effects on smaller scales.\n\nAdditionally, the authors identify an upturn in the hierarchical amplitudes on large scales (above ~43 Mpc), which they attribute to the presence of two large superclusters within the 2dFGRS volume. This finding highlights the limitations of using even large redshift surveys like the 2dFGRS for robust measurements of higher-order clustering at the greatest scales. The influence of these superclusters underscores the need for increasingly larger surveys to accurately probe the clustering properties of galaxies on these large scales.\n"}
{"id": "summarization_067", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \n Knowing what you need and want to accomplish will prepare you for choosing the right personal trainer. Some trainers will be well-suited to your needs, whereas others may seem lacking in the experience needed to help you. Consider your goals: many people start by saying they want to lose a certain amount of weight. Others aim for running in a marathon. And for others the goal can be simply to regain strength and health after an injury.\n\n\nKeep nutrition in mind when considering your goals. You may want to alter your diet as you get more physically fit.\nSome common fitness goals include improving your balance and flexibility, improving your immune system, or even just getting out of your comfort zone.\nMake these goals as specific as possible. So not just, “I want to get stronger abs,” but “I want to be able to do 50 regular and 50 inverted sit-ups in one go by the end of next month.”;\n, Before you commit to a workout routine (let alone a trainer), it is helpful to see how the physical activities your already enjoy could be a part of your training. That way you can avoid potential boredom and have fun at the same time you're getting healthy. Is straightforward weight lifting all that you're looking for? Maybe you want to improve your cardiovascular health but find most fitness routines boring. In that case you may want to find a trainer who does dance aerobics.\n\n\nConsider what sports you have played during your lifetime. Maybe you want to do workouts that incorporate aspects of these sports.\nOnce you start interviewing trainers, share this information and see if the trainer connects with it too.\n\n, There are many benefits of working alone with a trainer. Solo classes give your trainer more time to focus on your specific needs. He can also spend more time observing you, tracking progress, checking your vitals and improvements in health. You'll be the center of attention every time you meet. For some people this is ideal, but for others it may be a drawback.\n\n\nWith one-one-one training it's even more important that you are socially comfortable with your trainer.\n\n, Some personal trainers lead multiple clients at a time. Since there are more people working out together, you have more opportunity for a fun and social time. This can counter the boredom that many people claim they feel around working out. Classmates can also help keep you motivated and hold you accountable for doing exercises completely, correctly, and pushing yourself further.Many group classes are designed to be more engaging. Aerobics, choreographed dance, pilates, indoor cycling, kickboxing, muscle conditioning, and fall prevention are all examples of group classes with a range of style and experience.\n\n, Some people are not as interested in becoming an athlete, training for competitions, or anything that intense. For many it's just about dropping pounds, which is as good a reason as any to train. A weight loss clinic is a facility where you can consult with doctors and create a personalized weight loss plan. Medical professionals will then help you stick with your weight loss plan through weekly meetings at the clinic and check ins.You may want to call around to several different weight loss clinics in your area to find the right one for you. You can also ask the clinic about the quality of their fitness coaches and read reviews online for the weight loss clinic.\n\n, Working with a trainer in person could be the wrong fit for several reasons. Maybe you can't afford it, you don't want to commute to train, or you simply aren't comfortable with anyone you've met. It's also possible to use videos and video games as a replacement for a personal trainer.\n\n\nMany people have posted training videos on YouTube that can be accessed for free.\nSome professional trainers and athletes have their own video series devoted to different workouts routines.\nNintendo has motion-sensor based video games that lead you through workout routines. These have become popular with kids and adults alike.\nBe advised that any videos you find online may not be done by an accredited trainer. And so you cannot guarantee they are showing proper form or that they are as knowledgeable about health and injury. They also can't see you, so they can't check to make sure you are using correct form.\n\n, Are there programs you've heard of and want to give a shot? CrossFit, Pilates, YogaFit, and kettle bells are a few skills that different trainers specialize in.\n\n\nYou may then want to look into trainers who offer the types of training you are interested in. Search for a trainer who is a pro in CrossFit or a master yogi. Seek out a trainer who integrates kettle bells into her training programs. Often, the more specialized a trainer is, the more skilled she is at a specific workout or training style.\n\n, It's not necessary to throw your entire budget into havoc just to afford a trainer you're sold on. Even if you find a trainer who is a good fit, if he charges more than you can afford, you might need to make another choice. Make a budget and decide based on your income and expenses how much you're able to spend each month on physical training.\n\n\nPersonal trainer rates can range from $60–$70 an hour to as low as $25 an hour. Trainer rates are usually lower in small towns and cities. But there is usually not a big price difference between a trainer you go to at a gym and a trainer who comes to your house to train you., Word of mouth, whether from friends or acquaintances can be a solid source of information. Talk to people whose physique and health you admire and want to achieve. See who they work with and look into that trainer. Oftentimes talking to people who already have experience with a trainer is the most helpful way to make a smart choice.Keep in mind that not everyone likes the same kind of training. If you and the people you talk to have very different needs, goals, and respond to different kinds of motivation, their recommendation might not be helpful to you.\n\n, Joining a gym has the benefit of giving you access to a range of workout equipment. Some gyms also have technology for testing clients' physical health. Whether you are already a gym member, or still just considering your options, it's possible to visit different gyms in your area to learn about their trainers. Ask the people in charge for background info, credentials, and skill sets of each trainer.\n\n\nUsually gyms offer personal training as an add on cost. You can sign up for personal training and pay another fee on top of the monthly fee you pay for general use of the equipment and the space. They may also have contracts with trainers so they can only offer their services at that gym.Before signing up, try to find out how the trainers are paid and whether they work on commission sales. Sometimes commercial gyms hire personal trainers as sales people. Although they are well-meaning, these people can be more driven to sell you memberships and services, than they are to help you with your fitness goals.\n\n, The NSCA, ACSM, IDEA, and ACE all have search tools to locate credentialed personal trainers based on area code. Using these databases can give you a strong list of people to check out. And furthermore it can guarantee anyone you find will have the necessary skills and training to help you.\n\n\nIt's possible to have trainers come to your home. This is convenient and may appeal to you. However if you go this option, make sure you run a background check on the trainer for your own safety., If you are at a gym, pay attention to the trainers who are working with their clients. If they work in their own gyms, move from place to place as a consultant, or work outside of a gym, ask if you can come observe them work with a client. You'll interview them yourself later, but first you can gain valuable knowledge by watching them work with other clients.\n\n\nStaring in a gym is rude, but if you are using a machine near a trainer and client you can hear how they interact and get an idea of how knowledgeable the trainer is.\nDo the clients seem to enjoy being around her? Are her clients trying hard and do they seem motivated?\nDifferent people look for different qualities in trainers. While some people enjoy the intensity of a drill-sergeant, others need a more light-hearted and supportive approach.\n\n, See who you gel with and pay attention to your comfort level. Personality matters. No matter how good a trainer is, if you don't get along with him, you won't be happy. Some people want someone to scream at them, but others are intimidated by forceful trainers.\n\n\nDon't engage him as a potential client. If he asks, you can say you're just working out on your own for now before making a decision. Have casual conversation and trust your emotional instincts.\nTest his sense of humor. Tell jokes that reveal a little about who you are and what your perspectives are. His reaction will help you judge how you two may understand each other and get along.\n\n, Once you've found a few people who interest you, based in your observations and conversations, interview them one-by-one. Although you are the client, you're the one who is actually employing the trainer. So it is perfectly normal to ask any questions you have before making a commitment.\n\n\nA good trainer will listen to you, find out what your goals are, and help you reach those goals.\n\n, The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) are considered the most rigorous and respected programs for athletic trainers in the US.The National Academy Sports Medicine (NASM) and the American Council on Exercise (ACE) are the other two most reputable establishments.Any personal trainer who is certified by one of these establishments will have the skills and training necessary to help you with your fitness goals.\n\n\nTake a look at this chart for a comparison of the three accrediting agencies.\nOther countries, like Canada, have different governing bodies in each province, and many disciplines (yoga, martial arts, sports associations, pilates, etc.) certify various types of trainers and coaches in various disciplines. Trainers pay fees and must take ongoing training to maintain accreditations with these governing bodies.\n\n, It's important to know how long the person has been working as a personal trainer, as well as what kind of physical fitness he has been involved with beforehand. You might not want to work with someone who is new to working professionally. Or maybe you enjoy the vitality of a younger, albeit less experienced, trainer. That decision is up to you.\n\n\nAsk about his work experience, but also ask about any sports, competitions, performances, dance, and other physical activities he has spent his time on throughout his life.\n\n, Find out how she plans on motivating you to accomplish your goals. Once you've shared your goals, ask what kind of routines she envisions to help you succeed. Also find out how she plans on tracking your progress.\n\n\nTrainers can show you weekly routines she will lead you through to accomplish your goals. She will break down the hours trained and how all your time is divided between various workouts.\nStay realistic about your goals. For example if you tell a trainer that you want to lose 50 pounds in a week, and she says that's unhealthy and pretty unreasonable, don't be upset. People who promise you the impossible or don't point out reality may not be trustworthy.\nAsk about any specific routines or programs you are interested in (CrossFit, YogaFit, etc.).\n\n, Injuries happen with training. Ask how he plans on preventing and working with any injuries you have or may get later on. Also, he will need to know your health conditions so he can avoid harmful activities.\n\n\nIf you have major injuries and are working on overcoming them, you may want to find someone who has experience with physical therapy. Ask if the trainer has any experience with physical therapy or rehabilitation.\n\n, If you found a trainer through a gym or search database, get some direct opinions and information from her former or current clients. People who have worked directly with a trainer can offer insightful details about the trainer's personality, abilities, ups, and downs.\n\n\nWhen contacting strangers, be polite and grateful for the help they're offering you by giving their time.\n\n, Whether you like a potential trainer or not can become less significant depending on his availability. Have your own weekly/monthly calendar ready to compare with each trainer's open time slots. Look for someone who is free at times that accommodate your lifestyle.\n\n\nIt's possible that you like and believe in a trainer enough to change your own schedule. Be sure to weigh your other responsibilities and desires before going through with that kind of adjustment.\n\n, Observation, conversation, and interview can tell you a lot. However, nothing will give you a better idea of which trainer is right for you than actually working out with her. If your gym/athletic club offers free monthly trainings, take advantage of this opportunity. Use the free monthly session to get acquainted with the different trainers in the gym.\n\n, You don't have to sign up for training sessions with the trainer who gives you your initial tour of the gym. Trainers often show a lot of enthusiasm in conversation and may try to persuade you to be their client. Don't let anyone talk you into making immediate decisions. Instead, take the time to observe and interact with all the possible trainers. This way you'll feel more confident with your final choice.\n\n\nIf a trainer pushes you to sign you up soon, just politely decline his offer. Let him know you want to see what everyone has to offer before starting a trainer-client relationship.\n\n, The average range for personal trainers in the U.S. is $18/hr and can range anywhere from $9 to $48.59/hr.If anyone tells you he charges more than this, you are possibly getting taken advantage of and should move on. If he charges in the higher end of this range, look for experience, credentials, and a personality to justify it.\n\n\nIn Canada you can expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $120 or $150 per hour or per session (confirm this with your trainer). The average is around $40-50.\nIf you are meeting your trainer far from his \"base,\" will you be paying his travel time? Trainers are often willing to meet in parks and other public spaces, but make sure you know if this will be an additional cost.\n\n, Often times you can save money by buying multiple sessions at once. It's also possible to save money by joining in-group sessions. For either case, ask whether there is an expiration date on your purchased sessions. Also inquire about their cancellation and refund policy.\n\n\nIt's also common for trainers to include physical assessments in their deals. This could be testing for blood pressure, body fat, endurance, flexibility, and strength.\nMost trainers have a 24 hour minimum cancellation policy. If you miss a session and give less than 24 hours notice, you may still have to pay.\n\n, There are trainers out there who are unqualified to teach or take advantage of their situation to profit from clients' inexperience. Don't buy into trainers who try to sell you workout supplements. Oftentimes they earn a commission, and for most people (who don't want to be body builders), there is no need for more than a balanced diet and proper exercise. Also look out for trainers who give excessive advice about your diet. It's okay to come up with a new diet together, but personal trainers are not certified to offer dietary advice, even if they go by “nutritionists”. Only Registered Dieticians can legally make a meal plan for you.Your trainer may have nutrition certifications which allows her to provide some advice about diet including macro nutrient balance (fats, carbohydrates, protein), calorie guidelines, good eating habits and hydration. Most trainers know a great deal about nutrition but should keep within their scope of practice, which will depend on their certifications.\nImpatience is a critical attribute to avoid. Trainers need to work with each individual client's needs and capacities. Their job is to motivate you, not to push you out of frustration with your pace.\nProfessionalism is necessary. Even with trainers with whom you talk with informally and feel comfortable around are there in a professional capacity. And as such they should show care and service to you like any other professional.\n\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1. Identify the main topic and primary arguments presented in the article.\n2.

What did you get ?\nIndustrial Designer: Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Designing a remote control .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: That's about it , didn't get anything else .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it .\nProject Manager: Is that what everybody got ?\nIndustrial Designer: Did you get the same thing ?\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um . So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . And repeat that process three times . Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . Um . {vocalsound} So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . So who would like to go first ?\nMarketing: I will go . That's fine .\nProject Manager: Very good . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Alright . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This one here , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay . Very nice . Alright . My favourite animal is like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} A beagle .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nMarketing: Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So this is blue . Blue beagle . My family's beagle .\nProject Manager: Right .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Lovely . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {gap} Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , {vocalsound} I'm gonna be up there with them .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nProject Manager: Right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: There's too much gear . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Ok oh we do we do\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles .\nProject Manager: Ach {gap} why not {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Boy , let me tell you . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We might have to get you up again then .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I don't know what mine is . I'm gonna have to think on the spot now .\nMarketing: Impressionist .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Can't draw . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um .\nProject Manager: Is that a whale ? {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur ,\nProject Manager: Ah .\nIndustrial Designer: so um fish was a natural choice . Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go {vocalsound} eat everything in sight . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um .\nMarketing: Superb sketch , by the way .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Tail's a bit big , I think . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I was gonna choose a dog as well .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But I'll just draw a different kind of dog .\nMarketing: Yep .\nProject Manager: M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} That doesn't really look like him , actually . He looks more like a pig , actually . Ah well .\nMarketing: I see a dog in there .\nProject Manager: Do you ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Oh that's very good of you .\nMarketing: Yep . {vocalsound} Now I see a rooster .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Uh .\nMarketing: What kind is it ?\nProject Manager: Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um {disfmarker} That's just to suggest that his tail wags .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um {vocalsound} uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can {disfmarker} doesn't take up too much space .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um and uh {disfmarker} And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: which is quite amusing , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?\nProject Manager: It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's an after dinner dog then .\nMarketing: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah , so uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .\nProject Manager: Yeah , maybe . Maybe . {vocalsound} Right , um where did you find this ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Just down here ? Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .\nMarketing: 'Kay . Um , can we just go over that again ?\nProject Manager: Sure .\nMarketing: Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay . So cost {disfmarker} like production cost is twelve fifty ,\nProject Manager: All together .\nMarketing: but selling price is {disfmarker} is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf .\nProject Manager: Um I dunno . I imagine {disfmarker} That's a good question .\nMarketing: Our sale our sale anyway .\nProject Manager: I imagine it probably is our sale actually\nMarketing: Yeah , okay okay .\nProject Manager: because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .\nMarketing: Okay . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: But I {disfmarker} I don't know ,\nMarketing: Alright .\nProject Manager: I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?\nMarketing: Yes . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Think it will ? Um .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nMarketing: Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah .\nMarketing: Um f frequencies or something\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing: um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Um .\nProject Manager: I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .\nMarketing: I don't know . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , possibly .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?\nMarketing: Just a chara just a characteristic of the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?\nMarketing: Just {disfmarker} Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows ,\nProject Manager: Aye , I see what you mean , yeah .\nMarketing: something like that , yeah .\nProject Manager: Marketing . Good marketing thoughts .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yep .\nProject Manager: Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um .\nMarketing: Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: something other than just standard . Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the {disfmarker} thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .\nMarketing: Uh-huh .\nProject Manager: Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Or no , is it as much as that ?\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .\nMarketing: Yep . Yeah , I'd say so , yeah .\nProject Manager: Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .\nMarketing: No . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um right , okay . Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? Thin\nMarketing: Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other\nProject Manager: No , actually . That would be useful , though ,\nMarketing: other {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something .\nProject Manager: Oh . Five minutes to end of meeting .\nMarketing: It just comes along .\nProject Manager: Oh , okay . We're a bit behind .\nMarketing: Do you know what I mean ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .\nUser Interface: I know um {disfmarker} My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .\nMarketing: But {disfmarker} Right . Right .\nUser Interface: So um for them it was just how many devices control .\nMarketing: Okay so {disfmarker} Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,\nMarketing: I think so .\nProject Manager: do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: everything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nMarketing: such as the lighting in your house , or um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Oh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities .\nMarketing: An Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nMarketing: But each one's got its own little part .\nProject Manager: Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?\nIndustrial Designer: And you keep losing them .\nProject Manager: You keep losing them .\nMarketing: Mm .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Finding them is really a pain , you know .\nMarketing: Mm . Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: or it's kicked under the table .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: You know .\nMarketing: That's just really good id Yep .\nProject Manager: There {disfmarker} I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?\nMarketing: Uh , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Dunno .\nMarketing: sure . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay maybe . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something .\nProject Manager: My goodness .\nMarketing: And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table .\nProject Manager: Still feels quite primitive .\nMarketing: Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S\nProject Manager: Maybe like a touch screen or something ?\nMarketing: Something like that , yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer .\nMarketing: 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It looks better .\nMarketing: You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Um , nicer materials\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: and might be\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: be worth exploring anyway .\nUser Interface: Uh .\nProject Manager: Right , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually {disfmarker} what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Um .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . {vocalsound} And uh and that's the end of the meeting . So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: um , do we {disfmarker} We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something ,\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: right ? Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?\nProject Manager: Th Okay , well just very quickly\nMarketing: I I don't know .\nProject Manager: 'cause this {disfmarker} we're supposed to finish now . Um I guess that's up to us ,\nMarketing: Yep . Yeah , sure .\nProject Manager: I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think one factor would be production cost .\nMarketing: Okay , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Because there's a cap there ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: I think that that's the main factor .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um\nMarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , uh\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: thank you all for coming . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Cool .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} \n[Text End]\n[Requirements]:\n1.

Vice President Joe Biden is expected to be among the dignitaries... (Associated Press) \n \n \"This day will always be hard, but this place will always be strong,\" former Mayor Thomas Menino told an invitation-only audience of about 2,500 people gathered at the Hynes Convention Center, not far from the marathon finish line where three people died and more than 260 others were injured a year ago. \n \n In Washington, President Barack Obama planned to observe the anniversary with a private moment of silence at the White House. \n \n \"Today, we recognize the incredible courage and leadership of so many Bostonians in the wake of unspeakable tragedy,\" Obama said in a statement. \"And we offer our deepest gratitude to the courageous firefighters, police officers, medical professionals, runners and spectators who, in an instant, displayed the spirit Boston was built on — perseverance, freedom and love.\" \n \n Obama said this year's race, scheduled for Monday, will \"show the world the meaning of Boston Strong as a city chooses to run again.\" \n \n Vice President Joe Biden was in Boston for the ceremony, and he said the courage shown by survivors and those who lost loved ones is an inspiration for other Americans dealing with loss and tragedy. He praised four survivors who spoke before he did and said that though he's not a Boston sports fan, Boston is an incredible city. \n \n \"We are Boston. We are America. We respond. We endure. We overcome. And we own the finish line,\" he concluded, to loud applause. \n \n Earlier in the day, a wreath-laying ceremony drew the families of the three people killed — Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell and Lu Lingzi — as well as relatives of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier, who was killed in the aftermath of the blasts. \n \n Gov. Deval Patrick, Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley were among those who attended the morning ceremony held in a light rain as bagpipes played. O'Malley offered a prayer. \n \n They were also honored at the Hynes center, where the survivors who spoke included newlywed Patrick Downes and dancer Adrianne Haslet-Davis, both of whom lost their lower left legs in the bombings. \n \n \"We should have never met this way, but we are so grateful for each other,\" Downes said, describing the sense of community that has developed among the survivors. \n \n Carlos Arredondo, the cowboy hat-wearing spectator who was hailed as a hero for helping the wounded after the bombings, said he came to the tribute ceremony to support survivors and their families. Biden also mentioned him. \n \n \"You can see how the whole community gathered together to support them and remember,\" Arredondo told reporters before the program began. \n \n Boston police Commissioner Williams Evans said the anniversary is an emotional day and brings back \"some terrible memories.\" \n \n \"Hopefully, today brings the city and the families some sense of comfort and some healing,\" he said before ceremonies began. \n \n Between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m., a flag-raising ceremony and moment of silence will be held at the marathon finish line, to mark the time and place where two bombs exploded on April 15, 2013. \n \n Authorities say two brothers planned and orchestrated the attack and later shot and killed Collier during an attempt to steal his gun. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died following a shootout with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and is awaiting trial. He faces the possibility of the death penalty. \n \n The Tsarnaevs, ethnic Chechens who lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the Dagestan region of Russia, settled in Cambridge, outside Boston, more than a decade ago after moving to the U.S. as children with their family. \n \n Prosecutors have said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left a hand-scrawled confession condemning U.S. actions in Muslim countries on the inside wall of a boat he was found hiding in following the police shootout. ||||| (CNN) -- A moment of silence at the finish line, the tolling of church bells and a solemn flag-raising ceremony capped the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing on Tuesday. \n \n Under a steady rain on Boylston Street, where two homemade bombs last April 15 marked the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, scores gathered in the personification of a slogan that captured the country: \"Boston Strong.\" \n \n After a stirring rendition of \"God Bless America,\" ordinary people, bombing survivors, first responders and dignitaries -- including Vice President Joe Biden -- bowed their heads in a moment of silence, saw the American flag raised, and sang the national anthem shortly before 3 p.m. on the spot where explosions, carnage, screams and smoke interrupted one of the city's most joyous and popular events one year ago. \n \n Earlier, thousands gathered to mark the anniversary of a horror that shook the nation. \n \n \"We would never wish the devastation and pain we have experienced on any of you,\" said Patrick Downes, who was among the many injured in the twin bombings at last year's Boston Marathon. \"However, we do wish that all of you, at some point in your lives, feel as loved as we have felt this last year. It has been the most humbling experience of our lives. We hope you feel all the emotion we feel when we say 'thank you.'\" \n \n Downes was a newlywed at the time of the attack. He and his wife, Jessica Kensky, each lost a leg. \n \n Before the crowd gathered Tuesday at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center, he spoke of the three people killed in the blasts and a university police officer killed days later amid efforts to catch the suspects. He called them \"guardian angels.\" \n \n \"Let's show them they live on in our bonds of family, friendship and community and in the infectious spirit we will feel on the third Monday in April for years to come.\" That's the date of the marathon. \n \n After a string of speakers, Biden began his remarks by saying, \"I've never witnessed a tribute like I heard today.\" To the survivors, he said, \"My God, you have survived and you have soared. You are truly inspiring. I've never heard anything so beautiful as what all of you just said.\" \n \n \"So much has been taken from you, but you never, never have given up,\" he said. \n \n \"You have become the face of America's resolve for the whole world to see,\" Biden said, adding that people all around the world know the pride, courage, and resolve of Bostonians. \"That's why the twisted, cowardly terrorists who acted here and in other places do what they do. They try to instill fear so that we will jettison what we value the most and what the world most values about us: an open society, our system of justice, our freedom of religion; our access to opportunity, the free flow of information and ideas.\" \n \n The terrorists, Biden said, \"wanted to make America afraid so that maybe, maybe, we'd begin to change our ways. That's the objective -- the very soul of who we are. They figured if they instill enough fear, we will change. And it infuriates them that we refuse to bend, refuse to change, refuse to yield to fear. \n \n \"You are Boston strong. But America is strong. ... That's what makes us so proud of this city and this state. What makes me so proud to be an American is that we have never, ever yielded to fear. Never.\" \n \n At the marathon, \"the whole world witnessed ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things\" to help each other, the vice president said. \n \n \"America will never, ever, ever stand down,\" he said. \"We are Boston. We are America. We respond, we endure, we overcome and we own the finish line.\" \n \n 'Boston strong' \n \n \"Next week, we will run again,\" said Tom Grilk, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association. \"But on this day, in this place, in remembrance and resolve, we gather as citizens of Boston, Boston strong.\" \n \n One year ago, \"the very fabric of this community was tested to its core,\" he said, but the city \"inspired.\" \n \n \"You are strong at this broken place,\" former Mayor Tom Menino told the crowd, adding, \"the heartbeat of Boston is a mighty force.\" \n \n To those who lost loved ones and to the many who were wounded, Menino said, \"whatever you have to do to recover and carry on, know that the people of Boston and I will be right there by your side.\" Menino was mayor at the time of the attack. \n \n On April 15, 2013, the Patriots' Day bombings killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and wounded at least 264 others. The city then underwent days of fear as the two identified suspects, the Tsarnaev brothers, were on the run. Police say they killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in the process, and then Tamerlan Tsarnaev was run over by his younger brother, Dzhokhar, as they battled police. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts and is scheduled to go on trial in November. \n \n Obama: Boston will show it 'chooses to run again' \n \n \"A year ago, tragedy struck at the 117th Boston Marathon,\" President Obama said in a written statement Tuesday. \"Four innocent people were killed that week, and hundreds more were wounded. Today, we remember Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard, and Sean Collier. And we send our thoughts and prayers to those still struggling to recover... \n \n \"One year later, we also stand in awe of the men and women who continue to inspire us -- learning to stand, walk, dance and run again. With each new step our country is moved by the resilience of a community and a city. And when the sun rises over Boylston Street next Monday -- Patriot's Day -- hundreds of thousands will come together to show the world the meaning of Boston Strong as a city chooses to run again.\" \n \n David Yepez, a teen who was wounded in the attack, followed Downes at Tuesday's ceremony. He hailed the first responders, doctors and others who helped in the wake of the bombings. \"Thank you for your love, compassion and generosity,\" Yepez said. \"You have touched our hearts in a way that, many times, our gratitude could only be expressed through our tears of joy.\" \n \n Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dancer who lost her left foot in the attack, told the crowd, \"If anyone is wondering what they can do, what you can do, I would answer: Look around. People in your community need your support. They need your patience and they need your time. ... Let April 15 be a day when we all work together to make this world a better place.\" \n \n Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said, \"We share the same fears, the same hopes, the same community,\" he said. \"We are, in the end, one community.\" \n \n He added that he hopes \"as we remember the dead and encourage the injured, that we remember community. ... The power of love itself -- that's what community is.\" \n \n A series of musical performances helped set a solemn but hopeful tone for the ceremony. The world-renowned Boston Pops orchestra performed, with singer Renese King singing both \"America the Beautiful\" and \"For Good,\" a song from the musical \"Wicked.\" The Boston Children's Chorus performed \"Up to the Mountain.\" \n \n A year after the bombings, families of the victims are struggling to come to terms with the loss. \n \n \"She had that special, I don't know what it is, that special thing about her,\" said Lillian Campbell, grandmother of bombing victim Krystle Campbell, 29. \"And you felt happy around her because she was always laughing and bubbly. I loved her.\" \n \n Some victims injured in the attack are showing their perseverance by planning to take part in this year's marathon, scheduled for Monday -- even victims who suffered severe injuries. \n \n \"Last year, I was on the ground at the finish line. This year, I'll be running across it,\" said Kevin White. \"It kind of proves to people that evil isn't going to win.\" White, then 34, had shrapnel through his legs a year ago. His 71-year-old father, Bill, lost a leg. \n \n Authorities have announced extensive security plans for this year's marathon, which is expected to bring in $176 million for the Boston area's economy. \n \n Brothers Paul and J.P. Norden each lost a leg in the attack last year. On Tuesday, they began a trek: walking the entire 26.2-mile marathon route, along with family and good friends. \"I feel so blessed,\" their mother, Liz, said in a Facebook post, adding that she couldn't be prouder. \n \n Police investigate bags near finish line \n \n Hours after Tuesday's anniversary event, a police bomb squad investigated two backpacks near the marathon finish line, cordoning off the area. They \"disrupted and rendered safe\" both bags, police spokesman David Estrada said. In a Twitter post, police said the detonations were \"precautionary measures.\" \n \n The bags were found around 6:50 p.m., police said. One bag was unattended, while the other one was worn by an individual. \n \n A Boston police officer noticed a man walking down Boylston Street barefoot in the rain and wearing a backpack, \n \n The officer asked him what was in the backpack. The man said there was a rice cooker in the backpack, Boston Police Superintendent Randy Halstead said. \n \n \"Training kicked in. We looked into the backpack, saw that it was what appeared to be a rice cooker, had the individual take the knapsack off, drop it on the street, and he was taken into custody,\" Halstead said. \n \n Police spokesman Mike McCarthy said the man \"got very vocal. He was yelling something.\" \n \n The man, in his early 20s, has not been publicly identified. \n \n He was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace and possession of a hoax device, Halstead said. The bag was inspected and deemed safe. \n \n The second bag, which was abandoned, belonged to a media outlet, a law enforcement source said. \n \n An FBI spokeswoman said the agency was assisting police. \n \n Earlier Tuesday, police responded to a report of a possible pipe bomb near Boston's South Station. Investigators determined it wasn't an explosive, but rather a high-voltage fuse that didn't pose a threat, state officials said. \n \n Authorities seemed to be bracing for the possibility of more bomb scares. \n \n \"To ease fears & concerns relating to backpacks,\" Boston Police said in a Twitter post Tuesday night that they were \"discouraging their use\" at this year's marathon. \n \n CNN's Susan Candiotti, Haimy Assefa and Holly Yan contributed to this report. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Survivors, family members, dignitaries, including Vice President Joe Biden, and former Mayor Tom Menino gathered at the Hynes Convention Center and the Marathon finish line to remember the three victims killed, Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, and Martin Richard, and MIT Police Officer Sean Collier who was killed days later during the manhunt for the suspects.\n\nSurvivor Patrick Downes, who lost his lower left leg in the attack, spoke powerfully about the community support and the resilience of those impacted by the tragedy, saying, \"We would never wish the devastation and pain we have experienced on any of you. However, we do wish that all of you, at some point in your lives, feel as loved as we have felt this last year.\" He called the victims \"guardian angels.\"\n\nBiden praised the survivors' courage, stating, \"My God, you have survived and you have soared. You are truly inspiring. I've never heard anything so beautiful as what all of you just said.\" He emphasized the strength of Boston and America in the face of terror, declaring, \"We are Boston. We are America.

Music performances by the Boston Pops orchestra and the Boston Children's Chorus provided a moving backdrop.\n\nThe anniversary brought a renewed focus on security for this year’s marathon, with extensive measures planned. Some victims, like Kevin White and his father Bill, who both suffered shrapnel injuries in the 2013 blast, are determined to run the marathon this year. Brothers Paul and J.P. Norden, who each lost a leg in the attack, began a symbolic walk of the entire marathon route.\n\nDespite the solemnity of the day, an incident involving two backpacks near the finish line served as a reminder of the continued vigilance required. Police investigated and deemed both backpacks safe, one containing what appeared to be a rice cooker and the other belonging to a media outlet. This incident, along with an earlier report of a possible pipe bomb near South Station that turned out to be harmless, underscored the ongoing sensitivity surrounding security in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "summarization_071", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \n Before you sue a labor union for discrimination, you must first exhaust all administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC or your state agency. When you submit your discrimination charge, you must provide evidence that supports your claim of discrimination.Ideally, you should start a journal so you can write down incidents of discrimination as they happen.\nThis journal will give you specific details you need, such as the dates and times of the incidents and the names of the people involved.\nYou also may be able to gather evidence by talking to witnesses who saw the discriminatory acts. Get their names and job titles so you can include that with your report.\nDiscrimination is seldom overt. However, if you have any emails or other written correspondence related to the incidents you believe were discriminatory, you should gather those as well.;\n, Before you submit a charge, you must notify the labor union of the discrimination and make an effort to resolve the situation on your own. Your notice should be in writing so you can prove to the government agency that you notified them.The EEOC prefers that you make an effort yourself to resolve the situation by speaking directly to someone in the labor union, before you file a charge.\nYour notice should describe the discriminatory incidents with as much factual detail as possible, and state that you consider the incidents to be illegal discrimination.\nTypically the labor union will have a particular individual identified as the person who handles discrimination complaints.\nIf that person is involved in the discrimination you've experienced, or you can't notify the labor union for some other reason, be prepared to explain to the EEOC why you were unable to notify the labor union of the situation.\n\n, You cannot file a charge with the EEOC or your state's workplace discrimination agency unless you meet the basic eligibility requirements. The EEOC has an online assessment tool you can use.Generally, you must file your charge within 180 days of the date the most recent discriminatory act occurred.\nSmaller employers may not be covered by federal anti-discrimination laws, but all labor unions are.\nFor this reason, if you have been discriminated against by a labor union, you should be eligible provided you file your charge within the time period established by the EEOC.\n\n, To file a charge with the EEOC or your state agency, you must complete an intake questionnaire that identifies the labor union and describes the discrimination you've experienced.The EEOC's questionnaire is three pages long, and requires factual details about the discriminatory incidents, including the date and time when those incidents occurred.\nYou can download the questionnaire online and fill it out on your computer, but you must submit it to an EEOC field office.\nYou can either take it to the nearest field office in person or mail it. Taking the questionnaire in person is more efficient because you'll be able to speak to an EEOC agent immediately.\nYou can find the nearest EEOC field office by checking the map at http://www.eeoc.gov/field/index.cfm.\nMake a copy of your completed questionnaire for your records before you submit it to the EEOC.\n\n, After you've submitted your intake questionnaire, your case will be assigned to a government agent. The agent will be responsible for investigating your charge and attempting to negotiate a settlement.You'll be contacted by an agent for an interview within a few days after your questionnaire is received. This interview typically is completed the day you submit your questionnaire, if you take it into the field office in person.\nWithin 10 days of your interview, the agent sends a copy of your charge to the labor union. They have the right to respond.\nIf the agent finds a violation of the law, they'll assign your charge to an investigator. Otherwise, the agent will issue you a right-to-sue notice.\nThe EEOC has 180 days to complete its investigation. If 180 days pass from the date you submit your charge and the investigation is not complete, you may request a right-to-sue notice from the investigator working on your case.\n\n, If the EEOC uncovers violations of federal law as a result of the investigation, they may encourage a resolution of the dispute using mediation. Mediation brings you and the labor union together to negotiate a mutually agreeable settlement with the help of a neutral third party who serves as the mediator.Mediation is a voluntary process, so both you and the labor union must agree to take part.\nHowever, if you are able to resolve the dispute, the terms and conditions of your settlement will be outlined in a written agreement that becomes legally binding once signed by both you and an official representative of the labor union.\nMediation often can be a way to resolve the dispute without spending the time and effort on going to trial. But this doesn't mean you're obligated to take a settlement that isn't satisfactory to you.\nIf you are unable to resolve the matter through mediation, the EEOC may submit the issue to the Department of Justice for further action, or may send you a right-to-sue notice that enables you to file a lawsuit on your own.\n\n, If you decide to sue the labor union for discrimination, hiring a discrimination attorney is crucial. Federal court procedure is fairly complex, and discrimination cases can be difficult to prove.A good place to start your search is the website of your state or local bar association. There you typically can find a searchable directory of attorneys licensed to practice in your area.\nChoose a practice area related to employment discrimination to narrow down your search results to attorneys who take cases like yours.\nYou also may be able to find help from a nonprofit organization, depending on the type of discrimination you've experienced.\nFor example, if you were discriminated based on your disability, contact nonprofit organizations in your area that work with disabled people.\n\n, Ideally, you want to interview at least two or three discrimination attorneys so you can choose the one with whom you think you'll work best. Discrimination attorneys typically provide a free initial consultation, so this shouldn't cost you anything but time.Generally, you want to try to schedule your interviews within a week or two. If an attorney is too busy to meet with you in that time frame, they may be too busy to give your case the attention it deserves.\nIf you schedule more than one interview in the same day, allot at least a couple hours for the interview itself, plus travel time between the two offices.\nAttorneys may request information about your case before the consultation. If they have forms for you to complete, make sure you fill them out and get them to the attorney as quickly as possible so they have time to review them before your consultation.\n\n, Before your interview, think about the aspects of a productive attorney-client relationship that are important to you. The more questions you ask each attorney, the more value you'll get out of the initial consultation.Find out how much experience the attorney has representing clients similar to you, with cases similar to yours. For example, after explaining your situation, you might ask \"How many clients have you represented who had similar issues with their labor union?\"\nKeep in mind that discrimination cases can be very different. If you have been discriminated based on your disability, find an attorney with experience in disability discrimination cases, not gender discrimination cases. Ask about cases similar to yours, and what the results were in those cases.\nYou also want to find out what it's like to work with the attorney. Ask whether the attorney prefers phone calls or emails from clients, and how quickly they respond. Returning a phone call or responding to an email within 24 hours is ideal.\nAsk how often the attorney will keep you updated on the status of the case. You probably don't want an attorney who doesn't communicate with you for weeks on end, or who doesn't update you on the case unless you ask.\nIf another associate or paralegal will be doing a significant amount of work on your case, ask if you can meet that person as well. Observe the atmosphere in the office to determine if people there are committed to what they're doing and enjoy working there.\n\n, After you've finished your initial consultations, create a basic chart that will allow you to assess the attorneys you interviewed. The chart gives you the ability to visually identify the best attorney for you based on factors you choose.You may already have an idea in your mind of the attorney you like the best. Don't be afraid to go with your gut.\nKeep in mind that you need to have a close relationship with your attorney so you can talk about the instances of discrimination with them and be completely open and honest about the situation.\nDepending on the discrimination you've experienced, this may involve discussing matters that are sensitive or painful for you. For this reason, it's important that you feel comfortable and can trust the attorney you choose.\n\n, Even if you're hiring your discrimination attorney under a contingency fee agreement, you still should have a written retainer agreement. The agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the attorney's representation and outline how costs and fees are assessed.Most discrimination attorneys work on contingency, but some do not. Others may have a hybrid agreement, in which you must pay a flat amount upfront to cover initial costs, then the attorney takes a percentage of any award or settlement you receive.\nHave the attorney go over the agreement with you, and make sure you understand everything in it before you sign it. If you're paying your attorney a retainer, make sure the agreement outlines specifically what costs that amount will cover.\nIf you're paying your attorney by the hour, the written agreement should include a breakdown of costs and fees, and when you will be billed by the attorney.\nDon't be afraid to ask questions or speak up if there's something about the agreement you don't like.\nOnce you sign the agreement, get a copy of it for your own records. Litigation of your case could take more than a year, and you may want to refer to the agreement again.\n\n, If the EEOC or your state agency is unable to resolve your charge, they will send you a letter confirming that you have exhausted all administrative remedies and have the right to file a lawsuit in federal court.Make a copy of the letter for your own records and give the original to your attorney.\nA copy of your right-to-sue letter must accompany your complaint so the court knows that you're eligible to file a lawsuit.\nIf you haven't received a right-to-sue letter yet and the EEOC has been investigating your case for more than 180 days, talk to your attorney. You may have to request a letter from the EEOC before you begin your lawsuit.\n\n, The complaint is a court document that you must submit to the court to initiate your discrimination lawsuit against the labor union. It includes factual allegations that, if proven, constitute a violation of federal anti-discrimination law.Your complaint also must include a specific claim for damages. Typically you're asking for an amount of money, but your damages also may include non-monetary things.\nFor example, if you were denied membership in the union for a discriminatory reason, you may be seeking membership in the union as part of your damages.\nYour attorney will draft your complaint. Make sure they go over it with you before they file it. Everything in the complaint should be true and accurate to the best of your knowledge.\n\n, Once your attorney has finalized your complaint, they will take it to the clerk of the federal district court that has jurisdiction over your discrimination case. In federal court, the complaint also may be filed electronically.To initiate your lawsuit, you must pay filing fees of $400. Typically your attorney will pay these fees and add them to the costs of your lawsuit.\nIf you have a contingency-fee agreement with your attorney, you won't be responsible for these costs unless you win your case or receive a settlement.\nThe court clerk will give your case a unique case number and assign it to a judge. Your attorney typically will discuss this with you, particularly if they have past experience with this judge or know the judge's reputation.\nMake sure you receive a file-stamped copy of your complaint to keep for your own records. Keep all your court documents together with your EEOC forms and any other information you have concerning your case.\n\n, After your complaint is filed with the court, a copy must be given to the labor union so they have notice of the lawsuit against them. This must be done using the legal \"service of process\" so you can provide the court with proof that the labor union knew about the lawsuit.The labor union will have an attorney or specific person listed as its agent for service of process.\nFederal court cases typically are served by paying a small fee to a U.S. marshal to hand-deliver the documents to the labor union.\nYour attorney also may serve the documents using certified mail with return receipt requested.\n\n, After the labor union is served with your complaint, they have a limited period of time to file a written answer. In addition to the written answer, you also may expect the labor union to file a motion to dismiss.Technically, you may be eligible to win your lawsuit by default if the labor union fails to file a written answer by the deadline. However, you shouldn't expect this to happen.\nMost of the time, the labor union will deny all of your allegations and file a motion to dismiss based on your failure to state a claim.\nYour attorney will talk to you about the motion to dismiss. The court will hold a hearing on the motion that typically you will be expected to attend.\nYour attorney also may want you to testify at the hearing on the motion.\n\n, Provided you're able to overcome any motion to dismiss, the labor union typically will make a settlement offer. Your attorney will advise you on the offer, but it's your decision alone whether to accept or reject it.When evaluating a settlement offer, take into consideration the time and effort it will take to pursue your case to trial.\nThe first settlement offer typically will be significantly less than the amount you've demanded in your complaint.\nSometimes a counter-offer is better than simply rejecting a low offer out of hand because it signals to the labor union that you're willing to negotiate.\nYour attorney also may discuss with you the possibility of using mediation to arrive at a mutually agreeable settlement of the case.\n\n, If initial settlement discussions fail after receiving the labor union's response, court proceedings will start. The first phase of litigation is discovery, which is a time when both parties can ask each other for information about the case. The information you receive and hand over will help the parties prepare for trial. During discovery you will collect facts, interview witnesses, find out what the other side is going to say, and determine how strong your case is. In general, you will be able to use the following discovery tools to achieve your discovery goals:Depositions, which are formal in-person interviews with parties and witnesses. These interviews are conducted under oath and answers can be used in court.\nInterrogatories, which are written questions posed to witnesses and parties. The answers must be given under oath and answers can be used in court.\nRequests for documents, which are written requests to the other party asking them to hand over documents you could not otherwise obtain. For example, you might request internal memos, policy handbooks, email exchanges, and text messages.\nRequests for admission, which are written statements the other party will have to admit or deny. These requests help narrow the focus of litigation by figuring out exactly what is in dispute.\n\n, Once discovery concludes, the defendant will likely file a pretrial motion for summary judgment. If successful, the defendant will end the litigation and the judge will immediately rule in their favor. To be successful, the defendant will have to convince the judge that there are no material factual disputes and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the judge will need to be convinced that, even if they made every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose the case.\n\n\nYou can defend against this motion by filing a response. Your response will need to provide evidence and affidavits that tend to prove that factual disputes do exist. If the judge agrees with you, the litigation will continue., If you make it past summary judgment, you should try to settle your case a second time. Most labor unions will not want to spend the additional time and money necessary to go to trial. Additionally, because you have gone through discovery and summary judgment, the labor union will likely know the strength of your case. Start by approaching the labor union informally. If informal discussions fail, attempt mediation or non-binding arbitration.\n\n\nDuring mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with you and the labor union to try and find unique solutions to your disputes. The mediator will not inject their own opinions and will not take side.\nIf mediation fails, you might submit to non-binding arbitration. During non-binding arbitration, a judge-like third party will hear both parties present their cases. At the end of these presentations the arbitrator will draft an opinion and take sides. If both parties agree with what the arbitrator says, they can agree to bind themselves by the opinion.\n\n, If settlement discussions fail, you need to prepare for trial. As a final step in the preparation process, you will need to attend a trial scheduling hearing with the labor union and the judge. At this hearing, the judge will put together a schedule for the trial, which will include what issues will be tried. Make sure you bring up every issue you want to advance during trial. If you forget to bring up an issue, it might not make it on the schedule and you might not be able to argue it. , When your trial date arrives, your lawyer will argue your case in front of a judge and possibly a jury. During your case presentation, your lawyer will submit physical evidence and question witnesses about your case. The defendant will then have an opportunity to present their case. When the trial is over, the fact-finder (i.e., the jury or judge) will consider all of the evidence and make a determination about who should win. If you win, the labor union will be responsible for paying damages. If you lose, the labor union will not be found liable.\n\n\nFortunately, if you lose, you might be able to appeal the decision to a higher court. During an appeal, your lawyer will argue that the trial court made some mistake of law that caused you to lose. If you think an appeal is an option, talk to your lawyer. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1. Identify the main topic and primary arguments presented in the article.\n2.

.\ndemonstrated that permanent luting agents like zinc phosphate agent generate uniaxial retention forces from 2.5 to 4.7 times greater than provisional luting agents such as zinc oxide eugenol

transferring the load to cortical bone , implant and abutment , but different types of luting agents may not affect the pattern of transferring load to the cortical bone .\nhowever , different types of luting agents might slightly change the direction of the load transferred to the bone due to different displacement field of luting agents under the same mastication load . due to the palatal

Different luting agents were considered for the model.\n\nThree distinct loading conditions were applied to mimic masticatory forces: oblique (400 N), vertical (200 N), and horizontal (57 N). Von Mises stress, a reliable indicator for ductile materials, was used to evaluate stress levels within the cortical bone, connectors, implants, and abutments.\n\nThe study found that the loading condition significantly influenced stress distribution, with the oblique load generating the highest stress values. The maximum von Mises stress was consistently observed in the palatal region between the cervical area of the implant and the supporting bone. Notably, the type of luting agent did not have a significant impact on either the stress distribution pattern or the stress values within the bone surrounding the implant. However, the study found that connector regions experienced the highest tensile stress and were therefore the most vulnerable to fracture.\n\n The researchers concluded that while luting agents play a role in load transfer to bone, implant, and abutment, different types do not significantly alter the overall stress distribution pattern in the bone surrounding implants. The findings emphasize the importance of considering loading conditions when evaluating the biomechanical performance of implant-supported FDPs.\n\n"}

(AP Photo/Evan... (Associated Press) \n \n CLEVELAND (AP) — After weeks of planning and one ferocious outburst that upstaged nearly everything on the Republican National Convention's first day, conservatives' feisty but always improbable effort to deny Donald Trump the GOP presidential nomination succumbed to multiple causes of death. \n \n The lack of vital signs grew daily, culminating during Tuesday's roll call of the states that formally put Trump over the top. That vote saw a fizzling of what conservatives hoped would be an effort by some delegates to brazenly ignore state party rules and back the candidate of their choice, not Trump. \n \n \"Whatever may or may not have been planned, apparently it didn't happen,\" said Colorado delegate Kevin Grantham. He said party leaders wanted to \"make sure that Donald Trump is the nominee, regardless of what the states said, regardless of what the delegates say.\" \n \n The anti-Trump conservatives unified with another faction trying to alter party rules to shift power from the establishment Republican National Committee to grassroots activists, including many supporters of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a defeated presidential hopeful. But they were badly outnumbered by Trump delegates and party regulars who believed, like him or not, he'd won this year's GOP primaries. \n \n Also weighing against them — the rebels' lack of an alternative candidate, vigorous lobbying by an alliance between the Trump campaign and the RNC and a growing sense that it was time to unite against presumptive Democratic pick Hillary Clinton. \n \n \"You can stand your ground until the point comes when you would be compromising the country or the state,\" said Steve House, chairman of the Colorado GOP, whose delegation was loaded with dissidents and Cruz supporters. \"The team said, 'Let's stand up and support the nominee.' \" \n \n On the other side of the arena, the Utah delegation gamely announced that it was casting its 40 votes for Cruz. But the presiding officer awarded all those delegates to Trump because of a quirk in Utah GOP rules that allow votes only for active candidates at the convention — and Trump was the only one. \n \n \"There's been a lot of effort to make sure we have a smooth convention, that Donald Trump is the nominee and that we unite,\" said Phil Wright, chairman of the Utah delegation. He said awarding all the votes to Trump was the GOP's way \"of trying to squash any dissent.\" \n \n Since it became clear last spring that Trump was the likely nominee, conservative delegates around the country plotted ways to use the party's rules to derail him at the convention. They organized using social media, conference calls and seemingly endless emails. \n \n But they were soundly thrashed last week when the convention's rules committee approved guidelines for this week's gathering. That carried over to the convention itself, which is run by party leaders who wield the gavel and make final rulings on disputes. \n \n On Monday, conservatives demanded a final shot at rewriting party rules but were blocked. Their roars of outrage drew widespread coverage and distracted from party leaders' efforts to show unity, but still they lost. \n \n During Tuesday's roll call, the Alaska delegation split its 28 votes among Trump, Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Convention officials counted all 28 Alaskan delegates for Trump, citing a discrepancy in state party rules, and overruled the delegation when it demanded a fresh count. \n \n Underscoring the futility in challenging party leaders, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus explained the ruling against Alaska to the entire convention and said, \"In any event, have a great night.\" He then quickly left the stage as music began to play, leaving the Alaska delegates unhappy and vanquished. \n \n ___ \n \n AP congressional correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| So it’s official: Donald J. Trump is the Republican nominee for president in 2016. There’s no \"presumptive\" about it anymore; the delegates have voted and made it official. \n \n That was probably the biggest news of the Republican National Convention’s second night, but once the actual business of the event was out of the way, the focus was on jobs and family. \n \n The night’s official theme was \"Make America Work Again,\" and the political speakers, notably Trump’s former rivals and current sycophants Chris Christie and Ben Carson, tried to focused their rhetoric on jobs, touting Trump’s business experience and repeating tried-and-true Republican attack lines on President Obama’s economic record. \n \n But the show occasionally deviated from that theme with speeches from two of Trump’s children: Tiffany, his 22-year-old daughter with second wife Marla Maples; and Donald Trump Jr., Donald’s firstborn and a key lieutenant in the Trump Organization. \n \n This being Trump, the proceedings were not exactly stage-managed to perfection, and there were definite winners and losers at the end of the night. Here’s who ended Tuesday behind — and ahead. \n \n Winner: Criminalization of politics \n \n Chris Christie delivered easily the most chilling speech of the evening, referring back to his time as US attorney for New Jersey and leading the crowd in a mock prosecution of Hillary Clinton. \n \n His charges were numerous, and went beyond even the most extreme of Trump’s talking points in some places. They included: \n \n \"Ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity\" \n \n \"An apologist for an al-Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women\" \n \n \"Putting big government spending financed by the Chinese ahead of good-paying jobs for middle-class Americans\" \n \n \"She called Assad a different kind of leader. There are now 400,000 dead. Think about that: 400,000 dead. At the hands of the man that Hillary defended.\" \n \n \"An inept negotiator of the worst nuclear arms deal in American history\" \n \n \"A failed strategist who has permitted Russia back in as a major player in the Middle East\" \n \n \"A coddler of the brutal Castro brothers and betrayer of the family of fallen Trooper Werner Foerster\" \n \n \"Lying to the American people about her selfish, awful judgment\" \n \n After each of these accusations, Christie would ask the crowd: \"Guilty or not guilty?\" And the crowd would roar back, \"GUILTY!\" occasionally adding in a chant of, \"Lock her up!\" \n \n There were two genuinely unusual and somewhat shocking dimensions to Christie’s speech. One was the sheer severity of the charges he leveled against Clinton. He didn’t merely accuse her of mishandling Boko Haram. He directly accused her of responsibility for Boko Haram’s schoolgirl kidnappings, calling her an \"apologist\" for one of the most brutal terrorist groups on the planet. He didn’t merely accuse her of mishandling Syria but implied she was responsible for every death in the Syrian civil war. \n \n These are truly grave charges for which there is no evidence, yet Christie leveled them casually, like they were any other campaign talking point. That’s a remarkable escalation of rhetoric even for this bananas election. \n \n The second shocking element of the speech was the ease with which Christie essentially called for the criminalization of political disagreement. You can like or dislike the Iranian nuclear deal. But helping negotiate it, and supporting it, is not a crime. Doing that is participating in statecraft. Christie suggested that bad policy should put you before a jury ready and eager to condemn you for anything they deem mistakes. \n \n The whole feel of the speech — a prosecutor inviting a mob to condemn the accused on count after count — resembled a show trial more than anything else, free of any and all protections for the defendant. Obviously it wasn’t a real trial of any kind. But the implication was nonetheless clear: Clinton deserves to be dragged to court for what she’s done when what she’s done is pursue policy options that Chris Christie doesn’t like. \n \n It was a performative case for criminalizing disagreement, a perverse and authoritarian pageant that preyed on the worst, darkest tendencies of the Trump movement. \n \n Winner: Donald Trump \n \n Donald Trump is the Republican nominee. Officially. \n \n The votes are tallied. There can be no last-minute coup. The delegates aren’t going to be unbound and rebel to some consensus candidate like Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan. A #NeverTrump revolt isn’t going to happen. It’s too late for NeverTrumpers to mount a realistic third-party campaign. \n \n The convention went like every convention in recent memory: The delegates came and voted based on how they were bound, nominating the person everyone thought would be nominated. \n \n And yet unlike other recent conventions, the specter of a last-minute revolt hung over the 2016 RNC up until the last moment. As late in the game as Tuesday afternoon, there were still reported efforts to disrupt Trump’s inevitable nomination: \n \n Some drama/suspense behind scenes at RNC: Cruz backers debate entering his name into nomination a few hours from now. Party leaders nervous. — Tim Alberta (@TimAlberta) July 19, 2016 \n \n Yet despite all the scheming and the angst and the extreme unease of Republican elites in a position to attempt a putsch, Trump survived. He made it through. He got nominated. Whatever else happens this week, that’s a significant victory — more significant, given the context, than it was for Mitt Romney or John McCain or other recent GOP nominees. \n \n Winner: Benghazi, the issue \n \n Monday night of the Republican convention was very heavy on Benghazi, featuring two veterans of the Annex Security Team and the mother of slain diplomat Sean Smith, and references from numerous other speakers on the \"Make America Safe Again\" national security theme night of the convention. \n \n That makes sense: Monday was supposed to be about foreign affairs and defense, so attacking the Democratic presumptive nominee’s most famous foreign policy failing, particularly when the hardcore party activists at the convention are still deeply upset by that failing and what they perceive as its trivialization by the mainstream media, was a no-brainer. \n \n But Tuesday wasn’t about national security. It was about jobs. And yet it was still about Benghazi. \n \n \"Hillary Clinton's bad judgment, as you heard last night, left us four dead Americans in Benghazi,\" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared in a speech that really should have been about the Clintons’ history in his home state. \"She lied about her emails, about her server, about Benghazi,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked. \"She even lied to the family members of America's fallen heroes,\" Sen. Ron Johnson said, in an allusion to Patricia Smith's claim that Clinton lied to her about the cause of the Benghazi attacks. \n \n It was startling, especially coming after a first night already overloaded with Benghazi content, and a further sign that Donald Trump’s RNC is not designed to persuade undecided voters. It’s meant to excite his base by appealing to issues that enrage and energize them — even though those issues are not especially important to the people Trump needs to win over if he’s to have any hope come November. \n \n This was Trump and fellow party members playing into a longstanding Republican tendency of extreme overreach when it comes to Clinton scandals — and doing it in a very high-profile way, using time they could be using for persuasion. \n \n Winner: The Trump kids \n \n Tuesday night was Donald Trump Jr. and Tiffany Trump’s time to shine, another opportunity for members of the Trump family to humanize the candidate and present him as a real person with whom the American people can empathize and whom they can trust in the wake of their stepmother Melania’s botched, plagiarist mess of a headliner speech. \n \n And they did a pretty great job! Tiffany offered an almost entirely apolitical speech that was polished, confident, and human. She clearly understood that her father has a reputation as a brutal, abrasive figure whom one might expect to be a domineering parent with impossible expectations, and immediately set about trying to disabuse viewers of that notion. \n \n \"As a recent college graduate, many of my accomplishments are still to come, but my dad takes such pride in all [I've] done so far no matter how big or small,\" she told the crowd. \"I still keep all my report cards because I like to look back and see the sweet notes he wrote on each and every one of them.\" Translation: My dad is a real person. He reacts to his kids’ ups and downs the way any other parent would. He’s not this asshole you think he is. \n \n Better still, she bolstered this kinder, gentler image of Donald Trump while tying it into components of his existing reputation. \"My dad is a natural-born encourager, the last person that will ever tell you to give up your dreams,\" she said. \"I always look forward to introducing him to my friends, especially the ones with preconceived notions, because they meet a man with natural charm and no facade. In person, my father is so friendly, considerate, funny, real.\" \n \n Here she’s blended the counterintuitive vision of her dad she’s trying to forward — as kind, generous, sweet — with the vision most already have, that he’s relentless and persistent, for good or ill. Those qualities, she’s arguing, didn’t make him a merciless steamroller but a wonderful cheerleader and supportive figure. You don’t need to buy the narrative she’s pushing to respect the skill with which she pushed it. \n \n Donald Trump Jr. honestly seemed like a better candidate than his father, with a fluent grasp of the issues that Republican policy folks care about. He tried to defuse his and his siblings’ reputations as rich brats by acknowledging their privileged upbringing upfront and then pivoting seamlessly into a call for school vouchers. \n \n \"My siblings and I growing up were truly fortunate to have choices and options that others don't. We want all Americans to have those same opportunities,\" he told the crowd. \"Our schools used to be an elevator to the middle class. Now they are stalled on the ground floor. They’re run for the teachers and the administrators and not the students. You know what other countries do better on K-12 — they let parents choose where to send their children to school.\" \n \n Within a paragraph, he’d turned his own privilege into a chance to portray himself and his father as compassionate and concerned with the plight of the poor — and as a chance to reassure conservatives of his father’s ideological bona fides. \n \n The Trump progeny are not politicians, and there was no reason to expect their speeches to be especially great. But Donald Jr. and Tiffany acquitted themselves very well, delivering two of the best speeches of the night. \n \n Loser: Paul Ryan \n \n Most Americans weren’t watching the convention as early as 8 pm; the major broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox) start coverage at 10. So relatively few people saw Paul Ryan oversee the roll call vote procedure that saw Donald Trump finally, and officially, nominated as the Republican presidential nominee in 2016. \n \n Still, this was clearly a loss for Ryan, who had to oversee the nomination of a man he once called a \"textbook\" racist, whom he for weeks pointedly refused to endorse, even after it became clear that man had won the primaries. \n \n Ryan has tried to put a brave face on Trump’s nomination, arguing that he has little choice but to support the nominee. \"It is either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton,\" he said on CNN. \"You don't get a third option. It's one or the other.\" In essence, he’s been trying to signal to elites that his grudging support for Trump was a matter of protocol and that he was still the smart conservative they’ve come to love. \n \n But that balancing act went to hell the minute he stood before America and stated, \"Pursuant to rule 40d of the rules of the Republican Party, I formally declare Donald J. Trump and Michael R. Pence the Republican nominees for president and vice president of these United States...\" \n \n It’s hard to imagine a better way to make Ryan’s protestations that he was uncomfortable with Trump seem phony and worthless. When the chips are down, when the nomination was being decided, Ryan was out there in front, pushing Trump forward. He’s not Trump-agnostic. He’s Trump-boosting, the same as everyone else at this convention. \n \n Loser: States’ delegate announcers \n \n During the seemingly interminable roll call vote for president, each state and district/territory participating in the convention picked someone to represent the delegation and formally cast its votes for the nomination. \n \n In some states, this was a fairly anonymous figure. But in others, it was a major politician, or at least a rising star. In Kentucky, it was Gov. Matt Bevin. In Iowa, it was former Secretary of State Matt Schultz, a likely future gubernatorial/senatorial candidate. In New Mexico, Gov. Susana Martinez introduced a junior delegate who did the honors, as she stood by smiling. \n \n The result was that a slew of promising Republicans, all with bright futures ahead of them, are on tape enthusiastically praising Donald Trump as the \"next president of the United States,\" or at the very least standing by happily as someone else does that. \n \n In deep red states like Kentucky, maybe that’s not that damaging. But in swing states like Iowa and New Mexico, it’s ideal attack ad fodder. One can all too easily imagining a Senate race in Iowa where Schultz’s Democratic opponent plays footage of Shultz at this convention on loop to associate him with Donald Trump, who’ll either be a hugely divisive incumbent president or a discredited, failed former candidate who lost Iowa. \n \n In normal years, like 2012, exercises like this don’t really matter. Obviously everyone in the Republican Party backed Mitt Romney. But Trump is different, and everyone knows at some level that Trump is less acceptable. \n \n Loser: Michael Mukasey \n \n Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey is not exactly a moral paragon. Recruited from a district judgeship late in George W. Bush’s second term as a more professional-seeming replacement for Alberto Gonzales, he is now best known for his participation in and defenses of the Bush administration’s torture regime. \n \n He pointedly refused to say whether he considered waterboarding torture during his confirmation hearings, nearly derailing his nomination — only coming forward to suggest he thought it could be legal in some cases once in office. He would later gush of the CIA’s torture program: \"Brave and serious men and women, faced with the most terrifying attack in American history, and — along with the rest of us — fearful of more, devised and executed a program to get intelligence from captured terrorists who refused to cooperate.\" He also falsely claimed that torture led to the capture of Osama bin Laden. \n \n So it was rather rich to see him take the stage at the Republican National Convention and complain about Hillary Clinton’s systems administration practices, assailing them as indicative of Clinton’s disrespect for the rule of law. It’s a hard argument to take coming from someone who helped undermine the rule of law in the US by torturing people, which many would argue is worse than setting up a private email server. \n \n It was worse than rich, though.

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nImage copyright TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY \n \n Following a Mediterranean diet might be a recipe for a long life because it appears to keep people genetically younger, say US researchers. \n \n Its mix of vegetables, olive oil, fresh fish and fruits may stop our DNA code from scrambling as we age, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. \n \n Nurses who adhered to the diet had fewer signs of ageing in their cells. \n \n The researchers from Boston followed the health of nearly 5,000 nurses over more than a decade. \n \n The Mediterranean diet has been repeatedly linked to health gains, such as cutting the risk of heart disease. \n \n These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease Dr Mike Knapton of the British Heart Foundation \n \n Although it's not clear exactly what makes it so good, its key components - an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables as well as poultry and fish, rather than lots of red meat, butter and animal fats - all have well documented beneficial effects on the body. \n \n Foods rich in vitamins appear to provide a buffer against stress and damage of tissues and cells. And it appears from this latest study that a Mediterranean diet helps protect our DNA. \n \n Telomeres \n \n The researchers looked at tiny structures called telomeres that safeguard the ends of our chromosomes, which store our DNA code. \n \n These protective caps prevent the loss of genetic information during cell division. \n \n Image copyright SPL Image caption Telomeres cap the end of our chromosomes \n \n As we age and our cells divide, our telomeres get shorter - their structural integrity weakens, which can tell cells to stop dividing and die. \n \n Experts believe telomere length offers a window on cellular ageing. \n \n Shorter telomeres have been linked with a broad range of age-related diseases, including heart disease, and a variety of cancers. \n \n In the study, nurses who largely stuck to eating a Mediterranean diet had longer, healthier telomeres. \n \n No individual dietary component shone out as best, which the researchers say highlights the importance of having a well-rounded diet. \n \n Independent experts said the findings were interesting but by no means conclusive. \n \n Dr David Llewellyn, senior research fellow in clinical epidemiology at the University of Exeter, said: \"All observational studies have the potential to produce misleading estimates, and we should not assume that the association with telomere length is necessarily causal. \n \n \"That said, this large well-conducted study is consistent with the hypothesis that dietary interventions may lead to substantial improvements in health.\" \n \n The British Heart Foundation said: \"These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease.\" ||||| Conclusion In this large study, greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres. These results further support the benefits of adherence to the Mediterranean diet for promoting health and longevity. \n \n Results Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with longer telomeres after adjustment for potential confounders. Least squares mean telomere length z scores were −0.038 (SE 0.035) for the lowest Mediterranean diet score groups and 0.072 (0.030) for the highest group (P for trend=0.004). \n \n Given that fruits, vegetables, and nuts, key components of the Mediterranean diet, have well known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and that telomere length is affected by both of these processes, we hypothesized that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet would be associated with longer telomere length. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine the association between greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and leukocyte telomere length in US women within the Nurses’ Health Study cohort. For comparison, we also evaluated the association between other existing dietary patters (prudent pattern, Western pattern, and Alternative Healthy Eating Index) and leukocyte telomere length. \n \n Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that undergo attrition each time a somatic cell divides. 7 Telomeres prevent the loss of genomic DNA at the ends of linear chromosomes and in turn protect their physical integrity. 8 9 Telomere attrition has been shown to be accelerated by oxidative stress and inflammation. 10 11 Telomere length is considered to be a biomarker of aging; shorter telomeres are associated with a decreased life expectancy and increased rates of developing age related chronic diseases. 12 13 14 Telomere length decreases with age and varies considerably among individuals. 15 Studies suggest that telomere attrition is modifiable, as substantial variability exists in the rate of telomere shortening that is independent of chronological age. 16 17 18 Therefore, variability of telomere length may be partially explained by lifestyle practices, including dietary patterns. 19 As accelerated telomere attrition may underlie many chronic diseases, identifying modifiable factors that affect telomere dynamics is important. \n \n The traditional Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, and grains (mainly unrefined); a high intake of olive oil but a low intake of saturated lipids; a moderately high intake of fish; a low intake of dairy products, meat, and poultry; and a regular but moderate intake of alcohol (specifically wine with meals). 1 Observational studies and intervention trials have consistently shown the health benefits of a high degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, including reduction of overall mortality 2 3 4 ; reduced incidence of chronic diseases, especially major cardiovascular diseases 5 ; and increased likelihood of healthy aging. 6 \n \n We used multivariable linear regression models to determine the cross sectional association between leukocyte telomere length and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. We calculated multivariable adjusted least squares mean leukocyte telomere length z scores (and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals) across all dietary patterns score groups by using generalized linear models. Firstly, only age at blood draw was included in the models. Models were then additionally adjusted for other potential confounders (body mass index, smoking, physical activity, energy intake, and batch). Finally, other variables were included as potential covariates (for example, postmenopausal hormone therapy, history of hypertension, and socioeconomic status), but these were removed from the final models as estimates remained the same. All P values are two sided, and an α level of 0.05 was used. We used SAS version 9.2 for all statistical analyses. Reported STROBE guidelines have been the basis for reporting our results. 39 \n \n Telomere length was assayed in various batches corresponding to each study. To minimize the impact of potential batch effect on leukocyte telomere length measurements across different studies, we calculated z scores of log transformed leukocyte telomere length by standardizing the leukocyte telomere length in comparison with the mean within each individual study. 18 19 38 \n \n The average relative leukocyte telomere length was calculated as the ratio of telomere repeat copy number to a single gene (36B4) copy number. Leukocyte telomere length is reported as the exponentiated ratio of telomere repeat copy number to a single gene copy number corrected for a reference sample. In all nested case-control studies, the telomere and single gene assay coefficients of variation for triplicates were less than 4%. Coefficients of variation for the exponential ratio of telomere repeat copy number to a single gene copy number were under 18%. In the Nurses’ Health Study, the three year and 10 year interclass correlations for reliability were determined to be 0.80 and 0.60. Although this assay provides a relative measurement of telomere length, ratios of telomere repeat copy number to a single gene copy number highly correlate with absolute telomere lengths determined by Southern blot (r=0.677; P<0.001). 36 \n \n Relative telomere length was determined using a modified, high throughput version of the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction based telomere assay. 36 37 The quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction telomere assay was run on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Foster City, CA, USA). Laboratory personnel were blinded to participants’ characteristics, and all assays were processed in triplicate by the same technician and under identical conditions. \n \n In addition to age at blood draw, we collected information on factors potentially associated with Mediterranean diet and telomere length. Using the biennial questionnaires completed proximal to blood collection and a supplemental questionnaire administered at blood collection, we assessed various anthropometric, reproductive, and lifestyle factors, as well as factors that have been related to telomere length in the Nurses’ Health Study elsewhere: body mass index (kg/m 2 ), cigarette smoking (pack years), 33 34 35 physical activity (total metabolic equivalent hours of activity per week). 16 We calculated dietary factors, including energy intake (total calories), from the 1990 food frequency questionnaire. \n \n The Alternative Healthy Eating Index measures adherence to a dietary pattern based on foods and nutrients most predictive of risk for chronic disease in the literature. 32 The Alternative Healthy Eating Index ranges from 0 to 110 points. Each of the 11 components of the score (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, sugar sweetened drinks, nuts and legumes, red and processed meat, trans fat, long chain (n-3) fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, sodium, and alcohol) has a minimum score of 0 (worst) and a maximum score of 10 (best), according to component specific criteria reflecting either the current dietary guidelines or associations reported in the literature. Details of component selection and Alternative Healthy Eating Index calculation have been previously described. 32 \n \n We used principal component analysis of the food frequency questionnaires to identify prudent and Western dietary patterns. 30 31 The prudent dietary pattern is characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish and other seafood, poultry, and whole grains; the Western dietary pattern includes high intakes of red and processed meats, butter, high fat dairy products, eggs, sweets and desserts, French fries, and refined grains. Details of the reproducibility and validity of dietary patterns assessed with a food frequency questionnaire have been previously described. 30 31 \n \n Trichopoulou adapted the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score from the Mediterranean Diet Score to assess adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet. 2 The Alternate Mediterranean Diet score includes the following nine components: vegetables (excluding potatoes), fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, fish, monounsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio, red and processed meats, and moderate alcohol intake. The possible score range is 0-9, with a higher score representing a closer resemblance to the Mediterranean diet. We dichotomized each of the nine dietary components at the median. We gave participants with intake above the median 1 point each for vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, fish, and monounsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio; we scored intake equal to or below the median as 0 points for each component. We scored red and processed meat consumption below the median as 1 point, with 0 points for intake equal to or above the median. Participants received 1 point for alcohol intake between 5 and 15 g/day; otherwise, they got 0 points. Details of the Alternate Mediterranean Diet scoring system are described elsewhere. 3 \n \n In 1980 participants completed a 61 item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire to assess their diet in the previous year. In 1984, 1986, and every four years thereafter, an expanded food frequency questionnaires containing 116-130 food items was sent to the nurses to update their dietary information. Participants were asked about the frequency of consumption of each food item of a pre-specified standard portion size in the previous year. The validity of these questionnaires has been previously described. 29 We calculated all dietary patterns and diet quality scores from self reported dietary data on the 1990 food frequency questionnaire, the closest to the blood draw (1989-90). \n \n Multiple nested case-control studies have been conducted within the Nurses’ Health Study blood sub-cohort to investigate the association between leukocyte telomere length and cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive function, among others. 23 24 25 26 27 28 The analysis reported here included data on 4676 women selected as healthy controls (free of major chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease) from nested case-control studies, with previously measured leukocyte telomere length and completed food frequency questionnaires at the time of blood draw. \n \n The Nurses’ Health Study is a prospective cohort study of 121 700 female registered nurses in 11 US states, aged 30-55 years at enrollment. The study was established in 1976; since then, participants have completed biennial questionnaires to update information on demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and newly diagnosed diseases. 20 21 Between 1989 and 1990 32 825 cohort participants provided blood samples. Details of the blood collection and archival methods have been described previously. 22 \n \n Multivariable adjusted least square means of leukocyte telomere length z scores (and their corresponding confidence intervals) by diet score quarters. All dietary patters are represented: prudent pattern, Western pattern, Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) score, and Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED) score \n \n The figure ⇓ shows the association between other dietary patterns and leukocyte telomere length. Similar to the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, a higher Alternative Healthy Eating Index (that is, healthy eating) showed a weak positive association with longer telomere length (P=0.02), but we found no statistically significant associations for the prudent (P=0.09) or Western dietary patterns (P=0.32) (fig ⇓ ). Additional adjustment for body mass index, pack years of smoking, physical activity, and total caloric intake did not alter the estimates. \n \n We also evaluated the association between leukocyte telomere length z score and each component in the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score (table 4 ⇓ ). None of the individual components was significantly associated with telomere length, even after adjustment for multiple confounders (age, body mass index, pack years of smoking, physical activity, total caloric intake, and mutual adjustment for other components of the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score) (table 4 ⇓ ). \n \n Table 3 ⇓ shows the association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and telomere length. Higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet scores were associated with higher age adjusted mean leukocyte telomere length z scores (P for trend=0.02). The association remained statistically significant after inclusion of body mass index, pack years of smoking, physical activity, and total caloric intake in the models; the multivariable adjusted least squares mean leukocyte telomere length z score across Alternate Mediterranean Diet groups (≤2, 3, 4, 5, ≥6) was −0.038, −0.049, −0.010, 0.039, and 0.072 (P for trend=0.004) (table 3 ⇓ ). Additional adjustment for postmenopausal hormone therapy, age at menopause, history of hypertension, socioeconomic status, and case-control study set (batch), did not change the estimates (data not shown). \n \n Table 2 ⇓ shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants across Alternate Mediterranean Diet score groups. The highest score group (score ≥6) represents the closest resemblance to the Mediterranean diet. Compared with women in the lowest score group (score ≤2), those in the highest score group were older at blood collection (P<0.001), had slightly lower body mass index (P=0.01), smoked less (P<0.001), had higher intake of total energy (P<0.001), and were more physically active (P<0.001). As expected, women with the highest Alternate Mediterranean Diet score also had higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and total fat, as well as lower meat intake. \n \n Table 1 ⇓ shows the main age standardized characteristics of the study population by quarters of telomere length. The mean age of the participants was 59 (SD 6.6) years, and the exact age range of the participants included in our study was 42-70 years. As expected, a statistically significant inverse correlation existed between age at blood draw and telomere length: younger women had longer telomeres (P<0.001). Moreover, women with shorter telomere length smoked slightly more (P=0.02). Distributions of main lifestyle factors between the study participants (n=4676), in comparison with the rest of the Nurses’ Health Study blood sub-cohort (n=32 825) after age standardization, were largely similar (results not shown). \n \n Discussion \n \n In this large cross sectional study of 4676 healthy middle aged and older women from the well characterized Nurses’ Health Study, greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with longer leukocyte telomere length. Notably, whereas higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet score was significantly associated with longer leukocyte telomere length, none of the individual components showed an association with leukocyte telomere length, emphasizing the importance of examining the relation between dietary patterns, in addition to separate dietary factors, and health. This suggests that the association may be a consequence of the global effect of the overall Mediterranean diet. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index was also associated with longer telomere length; however, the strongest association was observed among women with greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet. \n \n The difference in telomere length for each one point change in the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score corresponded on average to 1.5 years of aging. A three point change in the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score would correspond to on average 4.5 years of aging, which is comparable to the difference observed when comparing smokers with non-smokers (4.6 years),35 highly active women with less active women (4.4 years),16 and women with high phobic anxiety scores with women with low phobic anxiety (6 years).17 \n \n Comparison with previous literature To our knowledge, this is the largest population based study specifically looking at the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and telomere length in healthy, middle aged women. Our results are consistent with previously published literature on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, particularly diet, and telomere length. To date, only one study has assessed the association between telomere length, telomerase activity, and different adherence to a Mediterranean diet.40 The 217 older people in this study had a mean age of 77, and the upper age limit for reliable assessment of telomere length is 75.41 Using an older age group is considered inappropriate because of “survivor” bias42 43: people who live longer tend to be more resilient to chronic disease and possess longer telomeres. The authors may be capturing survivor bias rather than an association between telomere length and adherence to a Mediterranean diet. García-Calzón et al studied the association between telomere length and changes in adiposity indices after a five year intervention study with a Mediterranean diet,44 in the context of the PREDIMED-NAVARRA trial.5 In this particular study, the outcome was obesity, and the association between telomere length and the whole Mediterranean diet was not specifically examined. Only two studies have examined the relation between a healthy lifestyle pattern and leukocyte telomere length.19 34 Mirabello et al observed a positive association between a healthy lifestyle (defined by low risk factors including low or no smoking, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, lower body mass index, and greater physical activity) and leukocyte telomere length in men.34 Similarly, Sun et al reported that a healthy lifestyle pattern (defined by five components: smoking, physical activity, adiposity, alcohol use, and Alternative Healthy Eating Index) was associated with longer leukocyte telomere length in women.19 One of the first studies to show a strong relation between physical fitness and telomere length in a large sample of patients with existing coronary heart disease was conducted by Krauss et al.45 They found that poor physical fitness was associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length in patients with coronary heart disease. Du et al reported, in the Nurses’ Health Study, that physical activity (even moderate amounts of activity) was associated with longer telomeres.16 Moreover, Ornish et al recently published an intervention trial on the effect of comprehensive lifestyle changes (diet, activity, stress management, and social support) on telomerase activity and telomere length in men with low risk prostate cancer.46 Results from this pilot study showed that a comprehensive lifestyle intervention was associated with increases in relative telomere length after five years of follow-up, compared with controls. Studies on the association between specific dietary factors and telomere length have yielded inconsistent results.34 47 48 49 50 Cassidy et al, for instance, reported a positive association between leukocyte telomere length and dietary fiber intake but an inverse association between total fat intake (particularly, polyunsaturated fatty acids) and leukocyte telomere length. No significant associations were observed for intakes of vitamin D or fruits and vegetables.50 These findings support the importance of examining an overall lifestyle dietary pattern, rather than individual food components. The Mediterranean diet score has been used to evaluate the association between the Mediterranean diet and overall mortality, as well as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and cancer overall.2 51 52 53 54 55 Trichopoulou A et al evaluated the contribution of the nine widely accepted components, which are used to build the Mediterranean diet score, and reported an inverse association of this diet with all cause mortality in a population based cohort in Greece.56 More interestingly, they found additive associations among components. The authors report that one of the advantages of using a Mediterranean diet score rather than focusing on the food components is the generation of fairly consistent results with respect to health benefits, whereas studies focusing on the components or food groups are often contradictory. As summarized by Trichopoulou et al,56 chance, non-differential misclassification, and residual confounding may have more important consequences when individual food items are evaluated rather than a multi-component, unidimensional score. The benefits on health and aging from a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet have been largely described. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been linked to lower all cause mortality, reduced incidence of major cardiovascular diseases and other chronic diseases, and greater health and wellbeing in people surviving to older ages.2 3 4 5 6 \n \n Possible biologic mechanisms Oxidative stress and inflammation have been reported to accelerate telomere attrition.10 11 57 Moreover, given human telomere composition, these DNA regions are more sensitive to damage by oxidation.58 59 In contrast, high antioxidative capacity slows telomere shortening.58 60 61 62 The established protective effects of the Mediterranean diet on oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may explain the favorable influence of the Mediterranean diet on telomere length, pointing to a potential biologic mechanism behind the well known anti-aging effects of the Mediterranean diet. The lack of an association with individual components is not surprising. Studies have proposed a possible synergy among the nutrient rich foods included in the Mediterranean diet that fosters favorable changes in intermediate pathways of cardiometabolic risk, such as insulin sensitivity and resistance to oxidation and inflammation,5 63 supporting the role of the Mediterranean diet as a whole. \n \n Strengths and limitations of study The strengths of our study include the large and well characterized study population, detailed assessment of dietary habits as well as other sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, and validated food frequency questionnaires and dietary scores. However, potential limitations should be considered. The cross sectional design precludes us from establishing a temporal association between dietary habits and telomere length. Leukocyte telomere length was assessed using a single measure, preventing the estimation of associations between Mediterranean diet and telomere attrition rate; assessing this requires a prospective study with repeated assessments of leukocyte telomere length. Although all analyses were adjusted for multiple covariates, unmeasured or residual confounding could still be present. Validation of self reported variables potentially associated with telomere length, such as self reported diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, has been done previously.64 65 66 Finally, the Nurses’ Health Study population predominantly includes women of European ancestry, and telomere dynamics may differ among other ethnicities67 68 69; therefore, results may not be generalized. However, the homogeneity among Nurses’ Health Study participants strengthens the internal validity of these findings by maximizing the quality of reported data. ||||| Photo \n \n The Mediterranean diet — higher in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and olive oil, and lower in dairy products and meat — has long been cited for its health-promoting benefits. Researchers have new clues as to why. \n \n They found that the diet was associated with longer telomeres, the protective structures at the end of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are associated with age-related chronic diseases and reduced life expectancy. \n \n Researchers used data on 4,676 healthy women, part of a larger health study, whose diets were ranked on a scale of one to nine for similarity to the ideal Mediterranean diet. Researchers measured their telomere lengths with blood tests and followed them for more than 20 years with periodic examinations. \n \n The study, published in the journal BMJ, controlled for body mass index, smoking, physical activity, reproductive history and other factors, and found that the higher the score for adherence to the diet, the longer the telomeres. The difference in telomere length for each point on the adherence scale, the researchers estimate, was equivalent to an average one and a half years of life. \n \n “Based on our data,” said the lead author, Marta Crous-Bou, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, “a three-point change in the adherence score is equivalent to 4.5 years of aging, a difference comparable to that between smokers and nonsmokers.” \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Having opportunities to take a break and take a walk, play with a pet, or some alone time may be available.\nAre there any animals at the host's house?;\n, Everybody is different, and a hyposensitive person will have different challenges than a hypersensitive person. Analyzing what your biggest challenge will be is important, since it'll help you to find ways to handle the gathering and its events.\n\n\nFor example, if you prefer to communicate nonverbally, but you think that your family members will find it hard to understand what you need, you can solve that problem by considering AAC to find a way of making yourself understood. Or, if you think you'll have trouble with not having flavorful enough food, ask if it's possible for the hosts to set out spices that people can choose to add to their meals.\nNoisy family members can be a drain on some autistic people. If your family members know that you're autistic, consider asking them if they mind if you wear earplugs. If they don't know you're autistic or they aren't okay with that, you'll need to find another way of coping with the noise, which can be anything from stimming to taking a break from the situation.\nNot everything goes according to plan all the time. Things can happen that you may not be prepared for. Do not spend your time trying to come up with every situation imaginable - you'll stress yourself out \"what-if\"ing. Instead, come up with the likely scenarios, as well as a few \"unlikely, but still possible\" ones.\nHave others help. Sometimes you may need to have people who know you well to help intervene. There is nothing wrong with this. You may well be among people who may love you, but not fully understand you or your needs. Having a trusted person able to help advocate for you, navigate the social scene and come up with creative solutions is a great idea.\n\n, It's normal for people to catch up with each other during a gathering, so you may be telling them about what you've been up to, and you can ask them about what they're doing.\n\n\nThink of a few different things that have happened to you lately that you'd like to talk about.\nRemember their interests. It is expected to strike up conversations at a family gathering, so if this is something you can do, be prepared for this expectation. It does not have to be long or involved, but a polite conversation will go a long way.\nFor example, if you remember that Cousin Jenny loves chemistry and Uncle Phil likes fishing, you can ask them questions about these topics.\nThink of questions you can ask, like \"How was your summer?\" or \"What have you been up to lately?\"\nBe aware that you may be asked to answer questions about your interests and activities.\nAutistic individuals often have very deep focuses on certain topics. Be aware that you will likely need to keep your conversation about these to a manageable level with people who are not so interested. You may be lucky if there is a cousin who loves going on for hours and hours about your favorite Pokémon, but it's likely to be boring - or even annoying - for everyone else.\n\n, A good way of preparing yourself for the gathering is to create a timetable or a \"schedule\" of what will happen during the gathering.By visualizing what will happen and preparing yourself for the course of events, the break in routine won't seem as daunting anymore, since you'll know what will happen and can prepare yourself adequately for it.\n\n\nTry following the timetable prior to the gathering, even if you can't make your surroundings emulate the actual gathering. This will help you adjust and make the break in routine a little less jarring.\nUnderstand that plans can change, and in social situations things are sometimes in flux. These timetables are subject to change. Unexpected problems like bad weather can change when travel happens, for instance. Or some people decide spontaneously to go for a walk.\n\n, Since a family gathering can get loud and possibly overwhelming at times, having a quiet place to go is a necessity. Oftentimes, places like bedrooms are off-limits during family gatherings, but bathrooms are accessible, and small out-of-the-way areas like unoccupied hallways (or even closets) can serve as a quiet place for you to go if you need to get away from the chaos.\n\n\nIf you don't know the setup of the gathering's location, try to get other family members to map out the place, if possible.\nContacting the host beforehand (described in-detail in a later step) can make it easier to find a place to go.\n\n, You might not know much about the family gathering or where it's being held, be anxious about going, or have concerns about other aspects of the trip, such as travel or dealing with annoying family members. Communicating with other family members about the gathering and its upcoming events can ease your mind a bit, and allow you to ask for advice, if you need any.\n\n\nIf you have other autistic family members, talk with them, too. See if they have suggestions or knowledge that would help you to handle the gathering. Just be aware that every autistic person is different, so what works for them may not work for you.\n\n, You can't hide in another room for the entire gathering; otherwise, there'd be little point in even going to the gathering. Using coping mechanisms is one of the strategies that will allow you to tolerate the gathering. If you've developed a collection of stims and other coping mechanisms, great! If not, try looking online for advice from other autistics on how to cope, using sites such as RealSocialSkills.\n\n\nCommon coping mechanisms for neurotypicals involve deep breathing, meditating, journaling in a quiet area, or focusing on something specific (such as a certain type of sensory input). You can try combining these with coping mechanisms that you know work for you (such as rocking in a rocking chair or deeply focusing on a special interest).\nCan you bring things that will block out sensory input? (For example, bringing earplugs or a pair of noise-canceling headphones to block out noise, or taking sunglasses to block out light.)\nCan you stim? If so, what stims will be appropriate for the time and area?\nCan you bring food that you know won't trigger sensory issues? (If you can't bring it, see if it's possible to make it at the gathering location.)\n\n, Gift giving follows an elaborate, confusing protocol that is problematic for many autistics. However, many family gatherings include this ritual. If you find yourself in doubt about what a family member would like, try getting them something you know they'd need (like a new blanket if you know their old one is tattered) or something that allows them to pick their gift themselves, like a gift card.For example, you could give them things like winter clothing or gift cards, or things that they've specifically requested as gifts, as long as you can afford them.\n\n\nFocus less on giving \"age-appropriate\" gifts, and more on what the person would actually enjoy.Things like stuffed animals and games may not seem \"age-appropriate\" for an adult, but if you know that an older family member likes those things, it's perfectly fine to give it to them.\n\nThat being said, avoid giving a young family member something that's outright inappropriate (for example, containing profanity, sexual content, or other questionable material).\n\n\nYou don't need to spend all of your money on someone; if they want something that you really can't afford, you don't need to feel obligated to buy it for them.\n\n, Communicating with the host can make it easier to handle the gathering if they know what you may need beforehand. Explain to them your needs, and try to compromise on accommodations that could be made for you. You might be surprised with how willing they are to make sure that you can enjoy the gathering!\n\n\nIf this accommodation could help other family members, too, then consider extending it to them as well. For example, you could ask the host, \"Would it be possible for us to set aside an area that people could go when they want some quiet?\", or \"Can I bring cornbread for everyone at the meal?\" If you don't think you'll be able to handle extending your accommodations to others, though, don't ask.\n\nDisclosing whether or not you're autistic is a personal choice, if they aren't already aware. If you're worried about your disability being misunderstood, you can choose to describe your autistic traits without ever saying that you're autistic.\nIf there will be gift exchanges at the gathering and you'll be receiving gifts, tell them something that you'd like as a gift, too. This will make it less likely that you end up with a gift that you dislike or can't tolerate.\n\n, Rushing to get everything done right before the trip is a bad idea for multiple reasons - you're likely to forget things, get overwhelmed by how hectic it is, and end up miserable on the actual trip. Create a schedule for what you need to do and when you need to get it done, and try to accomplish things at early as possible. If it's done early, you don't have to worry about it afterwards.\n\n\nEstablish and confirm transport plans, lodging plans, finances and budgets, and any plans for meeting up with family as soon as possible. Be sure to also arrange plans for things going on at home, if necessary (for example, if you have pets, who will take care of your pets while you're away), and plans for the trip back home.\nIf you need luggage, pack it at least two days before the trip. If you rush packing on the day of the trip, you're very likely to forget something important.\n\n, Many neurotypicals dress for comfort when going on longer trips, and as an autistic person, this is even more important to reduce the risk of sensory overload. Pick out and wear soft clothing that you know you'd be comfortable in for extended periods of time, such as cotton clothes, hoodies, or possibly sweatpants. Avoid stiff, formal clothing.\n\n\nTake the trip as an excuse to kick off your shoes. If shoes are uncomfortable, well, you'll be sitting in a car or plane, right? You don't need to wear them if you're not walking around!\nIf you have sensory problems that cause clothing to be uncomfortable, avoid clothing that will cause you distress, even if the trip is short. Avoid clothing with tags, clothes that rumple, or clothes made of any material that you don't like., If you're a passenger on a trip to the gathering, you likely don't want to be staring out the window of a car or plane for the entire ride. Having options that don't involve talking to others are important, especially if social interaction will wear you down quickly.\n\n\nYou can bring things like novels, coloring books, puzzle books (such as Sudoku), or electronics to keep yourself busy. Keep these, as well as stim toys, easily accessible.\nIf you're taking a laptop, phone, or tablet, you can download videos or games onto it beforehand. Start downloading them early in case the download takes awhile. Be sure to charge these devices, too.\nBring snacks and drinks for a long trip.\n\n, Most trips require sitting in a moving vehicle of some sort for extended periods of time, which can have its drawbacks on both hypersensitive and hyposensitive autistic people - a hypersensitive person may become motion sick, while a hyposensitive person may not have enough stimulation and start getting bored. Find ways to accommodate your sensory needs so that the trip can be less of a struggle for you.\n\n\nIf you're hypersensitive, find ways to avoid carsickness or airsickness, and ways to keep yourself from getting dizzy during the trip. Bring earplugs or headphones if going on a plane trip to block out the sound of the plane's engines - or if you're just going on a trip with potentially noisy passengers.\nIf you're hyposensitive, bring things that will fulfill your sensory needs, which can be anything from stim toys to electronics.\nBe respectful of other passengers. Wear headphones when listening to music or other sounds, don't bring bright or flashing devices, and avoid humming loudly or stimming in ways that invades their personal space. And respect their space - don't reach into someone's personal space, and don't kick someone's seat!\n\n, Driving requires a lot of focus on several different things at once, and it can be very draining, especially if you'll be driving for several hours. While driving may not be completely avoidable, if somebody else can drive, ask them to do so, in order to save your energy for the gathering.\n\n\nIf you do have to drive, take breaks when you need them to avoid overloading yourself or getting tired in the car.\n\n, Plane rides are noisy and can be quite stressful, which makes it important to take steps to negate the stressors. Wearing headphones during the plane ride can work if you're sensitive to noise,but there's more to air travel than just the flight; you'll need to prepare yourself for getting through the airport (which can be quite hectic during holiday seasons) and for wait times, as well as the new sensory input. Keeping your sensory needs regulated and stimming is crucial to getting through the airport, but there are ways to make screening easier, too.\n\n\nConsider wearing a medical bracelet or ID so that you don't need to explain everything to security officers, and script a quick explanation such as, \"I'm autistic and need to be told before somebody touches me\".\nIf you alert the security officers at the TSA that you're autistic/disabled, you can discuss with them ways to make the screening process easier, and you will not be separated from anyone that you may be traveling with.You can also use the special needs line.\nIf you're part of TSA Pre-Check, you will have access to a shorter line, and you will also not be required to remove your shoes, belts, or light jackets, nor laptops or liquids, from you or your bag.(However, it can take some time to be able to get access to Pre-Check lines.)\nPrepare yourself for the possibility of additional screening. People are randomly selected for additional screening, and there's a possibility that you may get picked out to undergo the screening. It's important to communicate your needs to TSA staff so that they know and can do what they can to help you through the screening process.\nPrepare for the time you'll need to spend at the airport, too, especially if you'll need to deal with long layovers. Delays at the airport are also common; be sure to have things to occupy yourself in the case of a delay.\n\n, If you get hungry, you may get stressed and more prone to sensory overload, shutdowns, and meltdowns. Ensure that you'll have time to eat while travelling. It may help to pack some snacks in case you can't get to a restaurant when you're hungry.\n\n, You don't want to be rushing to get to the gathering in time; this is likely to stress you out and will give you no time to unwind from the trip afterwards. Leaving early allows you to take more time to get there, and is actually recommended for plane trips since airport security can take quite some time. Allocating extra time for breaks during the trip is only possible if you have the time!\n\n, This will help you be at your best later on. Try taking a warm shower or bath, engaging your special interests, reading a good book, swinging and doing other sensory-friendly activities, and doing other things that you enjoy. Pamper yourself, rest, and have some fun, so that you feel relaxed and positive.\n\n, The typical \"fancy\" or \"dressy\" attire that's common at many holiday gatherings can cause a lot of distress for autistic people with sensory issues.However, many families prefer that people dress \"nicely\" for family gatherings, which can make clothing choices difficult. If you can talk to the host ahead of time about attire, do so; if not, pick out clothing that you can wear comfortably.\n\n\nDon't wear clothes with stains or rips, or clothing that's dirty. It's generally not considered socially acceptable.\nCheck with your host on what would be appropriate. Formal clothing may not always be necessary. Some families may open Christmas presents in pajamas, so it is OK to wear flannel pants. The wedding host may be happy to have you dress in clean informal clothing.\nIf you've bought clothes in the past that look like dress clothes but are comfortable, too, now's a great time to wear them. Just don't sacrifice your comfort for the sake of the gathering.\nIf what you're wearing is both comfortable and looks nice, that's great! But if you can't wear fancy clothing and be comfortable at the same time, don't force yourself to wear it.\nSome families want to take family group photos and have everyone looking nice in those photos. If your family gathering involves that, then bring (or even borrow) a nice outfit, wear it for the photo, and change back into your normal clothes.Don't think that it's \"just a few hours\" - those \"few hours\" in uncomfortable or painful clothing can make the family gathering much harder to manage., If the family gathering is not being hosted where you live, do your best to arrive early to the gathering. By arriving early, you allow yourself time to orient yourself with the house, find a quiet area that you could use to take breaks, and talk with the host without struggling to hear them over the noise (or interruptions from other family members!)., If you haven't talked with the host before arriving at the gathering (or even if you have), now is the time to talk to them. After greeting them, try to ask them about anything you may need - whether it's about where the quiet spot in the house is, or where you should put the bread rolls or gifts that you brought for the gathering. Get the important questions out of the way first, so that you don't end up needing to ask at a point where you're overwhelmed and losing your verbal ability.\n\n, Family gatherings are often a place where family members want to hug and tell you how much they missed you, or dive into potentially controversial or upsetting topics. It's an important time to set boundaries and make sure that others know what you're okay with and not okay with. Make it clear to others what you're not comfortable with, and stick to it.\n\n\nIf you don't want to be touched, make that clear, even at the expense of hurting someone's feelings. It's okay for anyone to not want to be touched.\nRedirect conversations you're not comfortable with. If your family members start talking about politics or religion, for example, and you aren't comfortable with that subject, say, \"I'm not comfortable with talking about that. Can we talk about something else?\", and change the subject., You shouldn't be afraid of looking a little different in order to cope with the gathering. Use the stims you need in order to be able to handle the gathering. It's better to look a little odd than to end up having a meltdown or shutdown.\n\n\nThat being said, avoid extremely loud stims or stims that would be destructive (such as ripping things or knocking your head on the wall). Use stims that won't hurt anyone or anything.\nIf you're concerned about looking strange, or if your family doesn't know you're autistic, you can try stimming discreetly.\nBuying or making a small stim toy before the gathering can be a great choice if you need a small toy for your hands to fiddle with.\n\n, With the sheer amounts of people and new input and information, you may find yourself getting worn out and needing to step away from the situation. That's okay. If you need to take a break, some things you can do are:Help out in the kitchen. Some autistic people find that repetitive tasks such as cleaning dishes or preparing food can give them a break from the gathering.Go to your quiet area. Make sure that people know not to bother you while you're in this area. If you can't use your quiet area, it's not an optimal situation, but you can go into a bathroom and lock the door - just be aware that some people may come knocking and asking if you're okay if you stay in there for extended periods.\nStay in less occupied areas of the room. If you're unable to leave, duck into the quieter areas of the room and stay there. Oftentimes, the sides of rooms will be less occupied, and it's not considered strange to sit or stand away from the crowds when there's a lot going on.\nAsk the host if there's something you can do or somewhere you can go. Some neurotypical people can get tired easily by crowds, especially if they're introverts, so chances are, they'll be understanding if you say that you want some quiet.\n\n, People love to talk about themselves, and you may find it easier if they do most of the talking. Find out what they like, and get them talking about it.\n\n, Food can be a problem for some autistic people, and with so many people talking at the table, it's easy to become overwhelmed. If you anticipate potential trouble with the mealtime, find ways to minimize the risks and making the meal enjoyable.\n\n\nTry to sit at a quieter spot at the table, if possible, to minimize the auditory feedback that you're hearing all at once. If you're sensitive to smell, ask that foods with strong odors be placed away from you, too.\nConsider establishing a \"game\" of sorts with conversation to avoid being overloaded with too much conversation. For example, there can be a typical \"What are you thankful for?\" discussion at Thanksgiving, or everyone gets 60 seconds to bring up a subject that they find particularly interesting.Eat what you know you can eat. Many autistic people are finicky about their food, which can be caused by anything from sensory sensitivity to not wanting to break from a meal routine.Choose foods that you know that you like and can eat without problems.\nConsider helping make the food, if possible. Some autistic people find that if they've helped to prepare a food, it makes it easier to try it.Bringing large servings of food to the gathering can be useful for mealtimes; it not only ensures that you have food to eat, but it gives others food, too., The holiday season is a common time for people to give and receive gifts, especially around religious holidays such as Christmas or Hanukkah. If giving gifts is part of this family gathering, prepare yourself for noise and excitement, particularly if there are young children around. Ask the attendees of the gathering if they can agree to open one gift at a time, rather than having multiple people open several gifts at once, to lessen some of the chaos. If they hesitate, point out to them that if everyone opens only one gift at a time, everyone can see what the other person has received. And remember, use your coping mechanisms, and take breaks if you need them.\n\n\nIf you receive a gift and don't like it, do not say that you don't like it - doing so is considered rude and may hurt the giver's feelings. Smile and say \"Thank you\".\nSome well-meaning family members may give gifts that you're unable to handle for whatever reason, whether it causes sensory issues or it's something that frightens you. If this happens, thank them, but put it back in its box. Don't feel obligated to use it.\nBe prepared - even if you haven't received a noisy, flashy, or otherwise overwhelming gift, another family member may end up receiving one. If they do, ask them politely to not use it while you're there, or to take it into another room. For example: \"That toy is really cool, Tessa, but it's pretty noisy. Do you think you could play with it in the living room instead?\"\n\n, Oftentimes, families like to spend time talking with each other and communicating about what's been going on in their lives, and younger children may play with each other (or with older adults). If you think you're capable of handling the family time and all the chatter, try to join in with some conversation and socialize with people. You can talk about many things, from school or work, to that weird news story you read the other day about those feuding neighbors. Be sure to listen to the person (or people) that you're talking to, and give them chances to speak, as well.\n\n\nSubjects such as religion, politics, and medical afflictions are generally not things to bring up at a gathering.Avoid bringing up these topics yourself; stick with more lighthearted subjects such as vacations, things that are on TV like sports and shows, and asking about family members who aren't at the gathering (such as \"How's your husband?\").If someone tries to bring up a controversial topic and seems like they want to fight about it, change the subject by either telling them that you don't want to discuss the topic, or starting a conversation with someone about a different topic.Some autistic people find it hard to relate to their peers. You may find it easier to spend time with family members who aren't in your same age range.\nIf you want to make conversation but aren't totally sure how to do so, you may want to learn about a few ways to start a conversation with nothing to talk about.\n\n, You don't need to overwhelm yourself into a meltdown or shutdown just because it's a family gathering. Take breaks when you need them, enforce your boundaries, and if you feel as though you're going to melt down, get somewhere quiet and stay there for as long as you need. The family gathering is not as important as your health and well-being.\n\n\nIf you need to leave early and can do so, then do so. Don't force yourself to stay somewhere that's overwhelming you.\n\n, Chances are, no matter how well you've handled the gathering, you're probably going to be tired afterwards. Take some time for yourself when you get the chance and do something you enjoy. Engage in anything involving your special interest, do a relaxing activity, and reward yourself with a treat.

Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nthe progenitor stars of core - collapse supernova explosions form in giant molecular clouds .\nsince these massive stars have a short lifetime many of them end their lives while the parental clouds are still nearby and may even still harbor small star forming regions that produce stars of lower mass . according to in galaxies like ours\nabout 70% of all supernova explosions are of type ii and should explode close to the dense clouds from which they were formed . after these stars explode ,\nstrong shocks are driven into the clouds , heating , compressing , dissociating , and accelerating the gas leading to a large variety of observable effects .\na picture book example is the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) ic  443 on which most studies of snr - molecular cloud interactions have been focused .\nbut recently more and more snrs have been discovered interacting with molecular clouds , e.g.  w28 , w44 , 3c  391 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* and references therein ) , and many others , among them the galactic snr ctb  109  ( g109.11.0 ) .    ctb  109  was first discovered as an snr in x - rays with _ einstein _\n@xcite and in radio in the 610  mhz galactic plane survey @xcite .\nit has a semi - circular morphology in both the x - ray and the radio and is located next to a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complex in the west .\nthis semi - circular morphology suggests that the snr shock has been stopped entirely by the gmc complex , and that the appearance is not simply due to absorption .\na linear feature in co ( ` co arm ' ) extends from the gmc complex to the local x - ray minimum in the northern half implying that a part of the gmc complex extends in front of the remnant ( see fig.[chandraco ] ) .\nthe cold interstellar medium in which the remnant is embedded has been studied in detail by @xcite .\nthe most puzzling x - ray morphological feature in ctb  109  is the bright , extended interior region known as the ` lobe ' .\nthe x - ray spectrum from the lobe obtained with _ xmm - newton _  is completely thermal @xcite .\nthe lobe could be the result of a hole in the gmc allowing the x - ray emission through with little or no absorption or it could be the result of intrinsically brighter emission due to an interaction between the shock and the cloud . in order to investigate the later hypothesis we obtained new high resolution x -

{"id": "summarization_080", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nHistory and Purpose of the Emoluments Clauses\nPersons Subject to the Emoluments Clauses\nAn important threshold issue in examining the Emoluments Clauses is determining who is subject to their terms. The scope of the Domestic Emoluments Clause is clear: it applies to \"[t]he President.\" The Clause prohibits the President from receiving emoluments from state or federal governments, aside from his fixed federal salary. The Foreign Emoluments Clause applies to any person holding an \"Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States].\" OLC, which has developed a body of opinions on the Emoluments Clauses, has opined that the President \"surely\" holds an \"Office of Profit or Trust\" under the Constitution. OLC opinions are generally considered binding within the executive branch.\nThere has been significant academic debate about whether OLC's conclusion comports with the original public meaning of the Foreign Emoluments Clause. Some legal scholars have argued that the Foreign Emoluments Clause does not apply to elected officials such as the President, but only to certain appointed federal officers. Other scholars support OLC's view that the President holds an office of profit and trust under the United States under the original meaning of the Foreign Emoluments Clause.\nIn addition to textual and structural arguments, these scholars debate the significance of Founding-era historical evidence. To support the view that the Foreign Emoluments Clause does not apply to the President, academics have observed that, among other things, (1) a 1792 list produced by Alexander Hamilton of \"every person holding any civil office or employment under the United States\" did not include elected officials such as the President and Vice President; (2)Â George Washington accepted gifts from the Marquis de Lafayette and the French Ambassador while President without seeking congressional approval; and (3)Â Thomas Jefferson similarly received and accepted diplomatic gifts from Indian tribes and foreign nations, such as a bust of Czar Alexander I from the Russian government, without seeking congressional approval. On the other side of the debate, scholars have observed that, among other things, (1) during Virginia's ratification debates, Edmund Randolph directly stated that the Foreign Emoluments Clause applies to the President; (2) George Mason, another Framer, articulated a similar view in those same debates; and (3) Alexander Hamilton, discussing the dangers of foreign influence on republics in The Federalist No. 22 , stated that this concern extends to a republic's elected officials.\nBeyond examining contemporaneous historical evidence of the Foreign Emoluments Clause's original public meaning, other evidence (such as text, precedent, and settled practice) is often usedâat least by some juristsâto inform constitutional meaning and interpretation. As a textual matter, both the Constitution itself and contemporaneous sources refer to the Presidency as an \"Office.\" The President receives compensation for his service in office (that is, \"Profit\") and is tasked with many important constitutional duties (that is, \"Trust\"). Furthermore, as discussed earlier, historical practice from the 19th and 20th centuries could support the view that the President is subject to the Foreign Emoluments Clause. Unlike Washington's and Jefferson's actions, several 19th century Presidents notified Congress or sought congressional approval upon receipt of gifts by foreign governments. Finally, the common practice among recent Presidents of placing their financial interests in a blind trust or its equivalent could reflect a concern that presidential financial holdings may implicate the Foreign Emoluments Clause. \nThe parties in recent litigation involving the Emoluments Clauses have not disputed that the Foreign Emoluments Clause applies to the President. A single district court decision has reached the merits of this issue. Weighing the evidence discussed above, that court held that \"the text, history, and purpose of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, as well as executive branch precedent interpreting it, overwhelmingly support the conclusion\" that the Foreign Emoluments Clause applies to the President. This case is currently on appeal before the full Fourth Circuit. \nThe Meaning of \"Emolument\"\nA key disputed issue regarding the scope of the Emoluments Clauses is what constitutes an \"emolument.\" This question has divided legal scholars and has only recently been addressed by any federal courts.\nScholars, courts, and executive branch agencies have offered several potential definitions of \"emolument\":\n1. Office-related definitions . Black's Law Dictionary defines an \"emolument\" as an \"advantage, profit, or gain received as a result of one's employment or one's holding of office.\" Some scholars argue that this employment- or office-centric definition of the term is the definition encompassed by the Emoluments Clauses, meaning that the Clauses prohibit covered officials from receiving compensation \"for the personal performance of services\" as an officer or employee but do not bar \"ordinary business transactions\" between a covered official and government. 2. Any \"profit, gain, advantage, or benefit . \" Others argue that the term \"emolument\" is broader in scope, applying to any profit, gain, advantage, or benefit. Under this broader conception, even \"ordinary, fair market value transactions\" between a covered official and foreign or domestic governments would be prohibited. Two recent district court decisions adopted this broader definition of \"emolument.\" 3. Functional or purpose-based d ef initions. Both the Department of Justice's OLC and the Comptroller General of the United States, on behalf of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), have issued opinions on whether the acceptance of particular payments, benefits, or positions would implicate the Emoluments Clauses. These opinions have at times appeared to adopt a fact-specific, functional view of the Clauses, focusing on the purpose and potential effect of the specific payments or benefits at issue as they relate to the Clauses' goals of limiting influence on the President and federal officers. The relevant assessment in some of these opinions has appeared to be whether the payments or benefits are intended to or could \"influence . . . the recipient as an officer of the United States\" under the totality of the circumstances. At least one commentator has asserted that the OLC and GAO opinions support a middle view that Presidents or other federal officers may receive \"certain fixed benefits\" without those benefits being considered emoluments so long as they are not \"subject to foreign or domestic government manipulation or adjustment in connection with\" the office.\nDebates over the scope of the Clauses have largely centered on their text, their history and purpose, and historical practice. With respect to text, for instance, proponents of a broad definition emphasize the use of the word \"any\" in both Clauses and the phrase \"any kind whatever\" in the Foreign Emoluments Clause. They also contrast those provisions with the limiting term \"whereof\" that links emoluments to \"civil Office\" in the Ineligibility Clause (the provision that limits the ability of Members of Congress to hold dual positions). But proponents of a narrower, office- or employment-limited definition note that the word \"any\" in the Clauses may simply be read as extending coverage to multiple forms of emoluments (beyond just monetary remuneration). They further assert that the use of \"emolument\" in the Ineligibility Clause is clearly tied to an office-based definition and supports applying the same definition to the other provisions. As for the Clauses' history and purpose, both sides point to dictionary definitions and other uses of the word (including by Framers) contemporaneous with the Constitution's drafting to support their preferred definition. Proponents of a broad definition also argue that statements about the general anti-corruptive purpose of the Clauses support reading it expansively, while proponents of an office- or employment-limited definition assert that the Clauses were the product of a \"balancing of values\" that included attracting candidates for federal service who may have had conflicting commercial interests. As for the corpus of OLC and GAO opinions interpreting the Clauses, proponents of the broader and narrower definitions both cite opinions that they argue support their favored definitions.\nIn 2018 and 2019, two federal district courts substantively addressed the Emoluments Clauses' scope for the first time. Both courts concluded that the term \"emolument\" as used in the Clauses \"is broadly defined as any profit, gain, or advantage.\" As to the Clauses' text, the courts found significant the use of \"expansive modifiers\" like \"any other\" and \"any kind whatever,\" and rejected the proposition that the term's office-related use in the Ineligibility Clause should control its use in the other Clauses. With respect to the Clauses' history and purpose, the courts, while acknowledging that broader and narrower definitions of \"emolument\" both existed at the time of ratification, found the weight of the historical evidence and the Clauses' \"broad anti-corruption\" purpose supported the more expansive definition. Finally, the courts viewed executive branch precedent and practice as \"overwhelmingly consistent with .Â .Â . [an] expansive view of the meaning of the term 'emolument,'\" observing that \"OLC pronouncements repeatedly cite the broad purpose of the Clauses and the expansive reach of the term 'emolument.'\"\nThe recent court decisions construing the Emoluments Clauses are not final, however. In fact, as discussed below, one of the decisions was reversed by a panel of the Fourth Circuit on a separate issue regarding the standing of the plaintiffs to sue, and the full Fourth Circuit has agreed to consider the district court's rulings. The other decision has been certified for an immediate appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit. Thus, the import of these decisions is uncertain. \nEnforcement of the Clauses\nSeparate from issues regarding the scope of the Emoluments Clauses is how the provisions' mandates are enforced, including whether and to what extent the federal courts and Congress have a role in addressing violations of the Clauses. A principal hurdle in recent litigation involving the President has been the doctrine of standing. Standing is a threshold limitation concerning whether the person or entity suing in federal court has a \"right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right.\" The limitation includes a constitutional component stemming from Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which limits the exercise of federal judicial power to \"Cases\" or \"Controversies.\" The Supreme Court has interpreted this \"case-or-controversy limitation\" to require, among other things, that a litigant have \"a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\" before the court. At a minimum, a plaintiff must establish that he or she has suffered a personal injury (often called an \"injury-in-fact\") that is actual or imminent and concrete and particularized. In other words, the injury cannot be \"abstract,\" must affect the plaintiff in a \"personal and individual way,\" and must actually exist or at least be \"certainly impending\" rather than merely possible in the future. The plaintiff must also show \"a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\" (causation) and \"a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision\" (redressability). \nRecent lawsuits over the Emoluments Clauses have been filed in three federal courts by (1)Â private parties who argue they compete for business with properties related to the alleged violations of the Clauses, as well as a public interest organization (the \"SDNY litigation\"); (2)Â the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia (the \"Maryland litigation\"); and (3) over 200 Members of Congress (the \"Congressional litigation\"). Each set of plaintiffs implicate distinct legal issues and precedents related to standing. Private-party competitor plaintiffs rely on the notion of \"competitor standing,\" which holds that an economic actor may have standing to challenge unlawful action that benefits a direct competitor in a way that increases competition in the relevant market. State plaintiffs also rely on a competitor standing theory and additionally assert harms to certain sovereign and \"quasi-sovereign\" interests of the state related to tax revenue, diminution of their sovereign authority, and the economic well-being of state residents in general. Finally, Members of Congress assert standing stemming from the alleged deprivation of their constitutionally prescribed opportunity to vote on the permissibility of particular emoluments under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, which implicates a unique set of standing principles that apply specifically to legislative plaintiffs. More broadly, regardless of the status or classification of the plaintiffs, the fact that a lawsuit involving the Emoluments Clauses seeks a court ruling on the constitutionality of the conduct of an official within another branch of the federal government means that courts must conduct an \"especially rigorous\" standing inquiry given underlying separation-of-powers concerns.\nAttempts by these various plaintiffs to sue for alleged violations of the Emoluments Clauses have thus far met with mixed results. With respect to private-party competitor plaintiffs, the district court in the SDNY litigation concluded that several such plaintiffs lacked standing because it was \"wholly speculative\" that any loss of business or increase in competition could be traced to alleged violations of the Emoluments Clauses rather than \"government officials' independent desire to patronize [the] businesses\" allegedly involved in those violations based on factors such as service and location. But the Second Circuit recently reversed the district court's ruling regarding the competitor plaintiffs, concluding that \"a plaintiff-competitor who alleges a competitive injury caused by a defendant's unlawful conduct that skewed the market in another competitor's favor [has standing] notwithstanding other possible, or even likely, causes for the benefit going to the plaintiff's competition.\" \nAs for state plaintiffs, a different district court concluded in the Maryland litigation that the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia (D.C.) had standing to sue as competitors based on their interests, along with the interests of their citizens, in hotels and event spaces that competed with a hotel in D.C. related to the alleged unconstitutional conduct. The court reasoned that, based on specific factual allegations regarding diversion of business to that hotel, the plaintiffs were \"placed at a competitive disadvantage\" because of violations of the Clauses that \"unfairly skew[ed] the hospitality market\" against them. Yet a panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed this decision, concluding that the theory of standing hinged on the proposition that government customers were patronizing the relevant hotel \"because the [h]otel distributes profits or dividends\" in violation of the Clauses \"rather than due to any of the [h]otel's other characteristics.\" In the panel's view, such a proposition required \"speculation into the subjective motives of independent actors . . . not before the court, undermining a finding of causation.\" The Fourth Circuit panel's decision has itself now been vacated, however, with the full Fourth Circuit agreeing to hear the case. \nFinally, as to Members of Congress, the district court in the Congressional litigation determined in 2018 that over 200 Members had standing to sue under the Foreign Emoluments Clause based on the deprivation of their \"opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote on whether to consent prior to . . . acceptance of prohibited emoluments.\" Faced with Supreme Court precedent indicating that individual legislators generally lack standing to sue for institutional injuries that amount to \"abstract dilution of institutional legislative power,\" but may have standing when their votes on specific items \"have been completely nullified,\" the district court concluded that the Members alleging violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause fell into the latter category. Central to the district court's decision in the Congressional litigation was its view that the Member-plaintiffs lacked an adequate legislative remedy for the alleged violations without court intervention. According to the court, although Congress as a whole could pass \"legislation on the emoluments issue\" to consent to or reject perceived emoluments, the political process would do nothing to address the deprivation of the Members' opportunity to give advance approval or disapproval of particular emoluments in the first instance. \nAs with the court rulings on the definition of the term \"emolument,\" the judicial decisions on standing to enforce the Emoluments Clauses are all subject to further review by the respective circuit courts. It is thus possible that the outcomes in some or all the opinions just described could change. If the effective split between the Second and Fourth Circuits on the viability of competitor standing theories as they relate to alleged violations of the Emoluments Clauses endures, Supreme Court review is also possible. \nBeyond standing, other doctrines may present potential roadblocks to judicial enforcement of the Clauses. For instance, though its continued vitality is questionable, the Supreme Court has traditionally applied a \"zone of interests\" test as a prudential aspect of the standing inquiry, which \"denies a right of review if the plaintiff's interests are marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the constitutional provision\" at issue. Applying this test in the context of the Emoluments Clauses, the district court in the SDNY litigation involving private competitors concluded that such competitors fell outside the zone of interests of the Clauses, because the Emoluments Clauses stemmed from \"concern with protecting the . . . government from corruption and undue influence\" and were not \"intended . . . to protect anyone from competition.\" Another potential barrier is the political question doctrine, a separation-of-powers-based limitation on the ability of courts to hear disputes where there is, among other things, a \"textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.\" In the SDNY litigation, the district court concluded that Congress's authority to \"consent to violations\" of the Foreign Emoluments Clause meant that Congress, rather than the judiciary, would be \"the appropriate body to determine whether\" the alleged conduct \"infringes on that power.\" \nReversing both these rulings, however, the Second Circuit recently concluded that (1) \"a plaintiff who sues to enforce a law that limits the activity of a competitor satisfies the zone of interests test even though the limiting law was not motivated by an intention to protect entities such as plaintiffs from competition,\" and (2) the judiciary's responsibility to adjudicate alleged violations of the Constitution was not lessened by the \"mere possibility that Congress might grant consent\" to particular emoluments. The district courts in the Maryland litigation and the Congressional litigation likewise agreed that the zone of interests test and political question doctrine did not bar those suits. But like the other issues raised in recent litigation involving the Emoluments Clauses, further review of the application of these doctrines is possible. Ultimate resolution of the issues is thus uncertain and will likely depend on the nature of the plaintiff involved.\nIf the courts lack jurisdiction to enforce the Emoluments Clauses, the political process would be the remaining avenue for enforcement. In this vein, Congress could seek to enforce the Emoluments Clauses through legislation, political pressure, or potentially impeachment and removal. For instance, given that the Foreign Emoluments Clause explicitly provides a role for Congress in evaluating the propriety of the receipt of foreign emoluments by federal officers, Congress may be empowered to create civil or criminal remedies for violations or establish prophylactic reporting requirements through legislation. Indeed, one bill from the 115th Congress would have required certain reports and divestiture of personal financial interests of the President posing a potential conflict of interest, among other things. Resolutions have also been introduced in the 115th and 116th Congresses objecting to perceived violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, as well as calling on the President to take certain actions based on alleged potential violations. That said, it is unclear whether legislative actions would provide an effective means to enforce the Emoluments Clauses against the President, given the possibility of veto and potential separation-of-powers objections. As noted above, the adequacy of these legislative options has been a central issue in the Congressional litigation as it relates to Members' standing, and the issue is subject to further review at the appellate level.\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Some argue it only applies to appointed officials, while others believe it applies to the President as well.  \n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which advises the executive branch, holds that the President is indeed subject to the Foreign Emoluments Clause, a view supported by historical evidence and precedent. However, legal scholars continue to debate the original meaning and intent of the clause.\n\n**What is an \"Emolument\"?**\n\nDefining \"emolument\" is another crucial point of contention. Some argue for a narrow definition, limiting it to compensation directly related to one's official duties. Others advocate for a broader definition encompassing any profit, gain, or advantage.\n\nRecent court decisions have favored a broader definition, interpreting \"emolument\" to include any benefit received by a covered official, regardless of its connection to their office. These decisions are still subject to appeal and may be overturned.\n\n**Enforcing the Clauses**\n\nThe report also examines the difficulties in enforcing the Emoluments Clauses.\n\nOne major hurdle is establishing legal standing, which requires plaintiffs to demonstrate they have suffered a direct injury due to a violation of the clauses.\n\nPrivate competitors, states, and even members of Congress have attempted to sue over alleged violations, but courts have applied different standards and reached varying conclusions on standing.\n\nBeyond standing, other legal doctrines such as the \"zone of interests\" test and the political question doctrine may also limit judicial intervention.\n\nThe ultimate responsibility for enforcing the Emoluments Clauses lies with the courts, Congress, or a combination of both. If courts lack jurisdiction, Congress could potentially intervene through legislation, oversight, or impeachment.\n\n**Key Conclusions:**\n\n* The scope and interpretation of the Emoluments Clauses remain subject to debate and ongoing litigation.\n* Defining \"emolument\" is crucial, with significant legal and political implications.\n* Enforcing the clauses poses challenges, with standing and other legal doctrines playing a role in determining judicial review.\n\nThe report underscores the complexity of the Emoluments Clauses and the ongoing efforts to clarify their meaning and application in the modern context.\n"}
{"id": "summarization_082", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nWarning: VERY VERY VERY LONG \n I wanted to share my tale, a woe of a nearly 18 year old.  Take it as you may, comment as you will, but I'm doing this just to get it all the anger out of my head. \n 15 I was, and though I looked around at my own school, I never felt the courage to ever ask anyone there out.  Met you one day hanging out with my sister, and 13 year old you blushed for some reason when I looked at you.  That was cute.  I liked that.  I had found a few girls attractive before that time in my life, but none had ever so much as blinked in my presence.  This felt different.  She had a shy coyness that made her beauty even more delightful.  And that night I happily thought of the maiden who first looked at me. \n Flash forward a couple weeks.  I'm invited along with my sister to a trick-or-treat festivities that Halloween; hadn't done it in years but I was invited and hey, she was cute, why not hang out with her.  Had a good time, walk back to her house when she tugs my hand and asks me out, if not somewhat awkwardly, saying she had never done this before and was unsure how to go about it; she had been planning to ask me ever since she first met me. \n The story isn't exactly lovey-dovey at first; she's not exactly allowed to date and this upset has her parents saying no to us seeing each other.  It was around this time I decided facebook might be a nice website to check out finally, and she and I commenced our greetings and got to know each other first there.  For a couple months, all we did was chat on facebook. \n She eventually got a phone that Christmas.  It was a joyous occasion for both of us.  We texted more frequently with all the time we had: \"how was your day?\" \"what are you up to?\" \"I was thinking about you <3\"  Still young, simple, innocent love. \n Not soon after we had what you could call our first real date; very late in the process but considering the trouble on her side it wasn't that unexpected.  A picture afterwards was captured in memorium that remained for the duration of our relationship the epitomizing image that we had of each other as a couple. \n Word of our dating gets around, and of course it's hard to explain how a sophomore got asked out by an 8th grader, but she told me to ignore those critics: she said she enjoyed our relationship and should let no one judge.  My pouting sister could deal with her brother dating her friend, said she, and I agreed. \n That May, in one of our rare monthly dates, we had our first kiss: my first kiss, as well as hers.  We texted more and more frequently, almost 4 hours a day now, and we lauded the seconds of bliss unknowable to us prior.  I felt enamored for the whole week.  Life was good. \n After a good half-year went by we started moving past the stage I'd call a mere crush.  We started texting more romantically: little kisses via text, poems and stories back and forth, and ruminations about what it would be like to see each other on daily basis. \n I should back up here, because it's important to note that that spring she had to decide which high school she wanted to go to: mine, or a nearby school of similar caliber.  I had pushed for her to go to mine obviously, saying that it was higher quality and that the other was overrated.  She felt pressured not to go to the same school though; she didn't want to face any heat from her parents should they think her decision was made because of her feelings for me.  The saddest part is a year later she told me that my school probably would have been the better choice; her current school was mediocre at best, and she got by by enjoying the new friends she made. \n Though summer brought more free time for both of us, her parents weren't still ready for us to hang out more regularly like a normal couple; the term \"dating\" was still yet taboo in conversation with them. \n As August came, with her going to a high school now far from my own, we still saw little change in the patterns of our relationship.  Texting was still the primary mode of communication with the occasion treat of maybe a dinner or a movie a month.  Our conversations grew more intimate, and though we kept our fantasies PG, our commitment around this time to our relationship seemed to grow a great deal.  Suddenly talking about the time in our future relationship, that glorious time when we could be together as much as we wanted and never feel lonely from distance, became our primary topic of conversation.  I had never thought about my future and what I wanted from it.  But to think about having a girl in my life, one I could love like that, was pure ecstasy. \n A small tragedy happened later in september: a date we had then managed to sneak us another forbidden kiss out of sight of any watchers, the third one of our relationship, if memory serves me.  We giddily talked more and more about the joys of mouths meeting, but at this point our luck ran out.  Her parents grew tired of our constant texting (mind you they still didn't approve nearly a year in now).  Her phone was taken for the night, but worse still, we were then denied dates for the next 3 months afterwards.  I weeped at the loss, later learning that it was due to the forbidden kiss, something that could have only been discovered through our very archive of texts... \n It was around this time I began to have doubts of our relationship.  I decided that maybe this toil between different schools and troublesome guardians was just too much a burden to have in my young love.  We had said our first true \"I love you's\" merely a few months prior, yet I felt a particular inevitability that the distance between us was too great.  It was at this time she spoke me to quite seriously, spoke of devotion more important that we had spoke of before.  \"If we can get through this now, imagine the future we can have for ourselves.  Imagine what we will say then: that we bared through the tough times, stuck together for each other.  That we loved each other enough to put in the effort to make the love last.\"  Inspiring words from a high school freshman.  The inception planted would later grow, grow to have repercussions... \n Skip forward a few more months.  Spring of next year and we were back on track with our still infrequent dating.  No longer did she kiss me, constantly fearing discovery, yet always lamenting her paranoia the day after to me.  I forgave, remember it was the future that mattered; I could live without kisses for a while.  I knew I would get more than enough to make up for them later. \n Our conversations lessened slightly, but only because of decreased time due her difficult classes.  She struggled with math and had to study quite a bit, leaving little time to chat for us.  I spent this time daydreaming; I had always considered myself a romantic, and imagining sweet times with my sweet girl was sweet treat for me always. \n When we had the time to talk, the \"future\" topic become almost half of all of our conversations.  We'd greet with the normal \"how are you\" and \"how was your day\", then almost immediately move on to \"can you imagine us on the beach together?\", \"think of those weekends in college where we can enjoy a whole day of each other's company\".  Eventually this even became \"can you imagine what our life together will be like eventually?\"  We were only 1.5 years in but we both had ideas of a very very very long-term commitment in mind. \n August of next year and believe it or not this was when we had our very first fight, a bitter back and forth spat via text our some of our opinions on something she enjoyed doing.  It was frivolous in retrospect, but she remarked sadly afterwards that she thought we were too good to fight, and that she could never have imagined it happening.  I gave an apology, to which I received one of equal remorse, and we put it behind us.  Whether that had anything to do with what happened next month I'll never know. \n Late September and all was as usual: dates were infrequent yet enjoyable, texting was just as romantic and imaginative as always.  Everything seemed great.  I was happy.  She seemed happy. \n That next weekend we were to go to a anime con; she was a self-proclaimed \"japanophile\", something that always nagged at me but I brushed it aside because her little quirks weren't so bad; after all, no love is perfect. \n That anime con was less than enjoyable.  I professed to her that it wasn't my thing a few hours in and was disappointed to drag the mood of the group down.  She nodded understandingly and just hugged me.  We were alone at the time in a small hallway, and I asked for a kiss.  She shook her head.  At the time I still felt sympathy for her paranoia, yet even still, that paranoia made no sense.  I calmed the warning flags and endured the con, trying to smile for her sake. \n That Monday before I drove home from school, I received a text: \"we need to talk.\"  I knew immediately what that meant, as my eyes started to swell, but I was stalwart: \"it's not that bad, it can't be that, there's no way, that would never make sense.\"  I called her immediately to try to put my fears to rest: \"I want to break up with you,\" I heard. \n Heart stopped, mind ached.  My hands on the steering wheel tensed then sweated, then gripped the wheel tighter then ever.  I maintained my composure, told her I okay, but of course wanted to know: \"why?\"\n\"Over the past week, I just suddenly stopped feeling the love I once had.  I still think you are amazing, but I can't think of you romantically like I used to.  I'm sorry.\" \n Hung up the phone.  For the first 5 minutes, I lay silent and listened to the radio.  Very suddenly tears.  I cried like a young child in pain; tears hadn't left those eyes since before we had ever dated.  I texted her later that night: she still wanted friendship (oh the terrible friendzone), and of course I held on desperately \"yes, yes, we can still be friends\". \n A day passed.  We had planned a month beforehand to go to her homecoming which was to be in two weeks after the breakup; we had never had a dance before and seeing as how we were approaching two years this was a big deal.  I asked her if we could still go just so we could have that one last moment together.  \"Someone just asked me to it today.\" \n More tears.  More pain.  I had never known this kind of sadness.  I felt destroyed inside.  Here was my beautiful girlfriend, my supposed wife-to-be according to all those fantasies we had, suddenly taken by another boy a mere day after our break-up. \n A couple weeks go by.  We still continued texting as \"friends\", continued normal conversation sans romance, yet even then I broke down every so often, \"why did this happen to us?\"  I kept on the questions, always returned by patience half answers and somber replies.  I was still beyond heartbroken.  My greatest mystery was what went wrong. \n Soon after the homecoming I asked her if she and her date were dating: \"no, I don't have feelings for him\".  Me and an old friend who also goes to her school met each other and started talking.  I told her about the recent breakup and she gave her two cents and wished me luck.  A couple days later she texted me \"your ex and her homecoming date have been holding hands; I thought you should know.\" \n Fury.  Anger.  Rage.  Betrayal.  Words that I'd have never defame the devil himself with spewed from the darkest abyss of my mind.  DEMON, LIAR, WITCH!  I held down the storm and texted my ex as I had normally been doing the past few weeks.  When I confronted her, she admitted that there were feelings but that they only came after I had asked (yet this had been only couple days after said asking).  She let it slip in that it was she that asked him, something she had been planning since at least the day before our breakup. \n My previous anger was nothing.  Never before have I ever wished harm on any human being to exist, but I swear I wanted vengeance like no other.  This was cheating!  I swore to her up and down I never wanted to speak to her again. \n I was very very fickle... \n Not 3 days later but I decided to send a long message, entailing an apology for my vile words the days before but continuing my theme of extreme disappointment.  I had been told she did this out of pity for the boy, that he was naive, had a crush, and she fell for him after trying to make him feel better.  But no, I insisted on the more evil explanation, left her my best regards, and said goodbye. \n That goodbye lasted 5 days. \n About this time, now Wednesday, my fickle and forgiving heart, my forgetful and weak soul, my senseless mind and lonely body all coerced me to go back on my word: I would talk to her again.  At the time, it seemed reasonable: she had been my closest friend, knew everything about me and I everything about her.  We talked and discussed everything we ever cared about.  We could still be friends, put aside the bitter death of the romance, try to preserve the remaining happiness we could share platonically with one another. \n She and I then recapitulated our friendship, which acted normal.  I justified my anger that grew dormant, told myself her relationship was nothing, would end, and that she didn't really like him. \n I mean in my mind, how could he?  He had little to offer in comparison to myself.  I had given all my love to this sweet girl and somehow the lonely onlooker was more enticing.  Bah humbug, said I, she'll see.  \"I was always the best for thee.\" \n I honestly thought that.  I still probably do.  In all honesty I think I gave everything I had, all the love that could be of want, everything in my power to make her feel special and wanted.  For a time I did just that.  She told me in our times together I made her feel worth something, that I was the sweetest and most genuinely sincere and kind boy she had ever met.  Many confessions of love between us were had throughout our time together.  Many professions of commitment beyond what was expected of us were made.  Each a promise: we would love this relationship for years and years.  Every day I woke up smiling to those promises: \"just imagine, you'll have a beautiful love to wake up to every day just a a few years down the road.\" \n I was a fool to believe such young love would last.  To believe a young girl's feeling could be trusted.  Today when I saw that relationship status switch to on between her and that boy, that vile comment: \"about time already\", I called it quits.  I don't know what I'll do at this point, but I know I can't try to and reconcile this relationship ever.  My shattered heart weeps every night since, having lost its most precious emotion.  At this point, I don't know what to do.  Whether I continue this grotesque \"friendship\" she says she wants with me is still up in the air. \n To lose love, especially your first, feels like a bullet to your very soul.  I feel like my very heart, given freely to another, has been trampled and spat on. \n I will miss my love, but I will not miss my lover. \n Thank you for taking the time to read this. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_083", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \n The large field of creative writing splits into subcategories (fiction, poetry, creative-nonfiction) and there are even specialized genres (sci-fi, mysteries, experimental… the list goes on). Figure out what you want to write. Write what you would want to read. Your best writing will spring forth from something that you, and maybe only you, are passionate about. When your passion is injected into your writing, your readers will, in turn, be interested. Your passion for your individual writing project is a powerful tool that will serve well as a starting point.\n\n\nRemember that you don’t have to limit yourself to a single field. Many established writers spread out and explore—perhaps they write creative essays while publishing their creative non-fiction work. Maybe their short novels have poems inside of them.;\n, Establish a particular time of day, location, and atmosphere for your writing sessions. As you establish this routine, the creative side of your brain will become accustomed to working in these familiar conditions. Things to consider are…\n\n\nNoise: some writers enjoy absolute quiet. Others will listen to music to jog their creative juices. Others will want the company of friends to bounce ideas.\nTime: Some writers jot down thoughts just before they sleep. Early mornings hours work well for others, as fewer people are awake to bother them. Other writers may enjoy being badgered, and therefore write in between coffee break or other work sessions. Other writers will like long periods of undisturbed writing time, and dedicate their weekends to writing.\nLocation: establishing a particular building, room, or even chair can help the writing process. This familiarity will train your brain to work creatively, or technically, to suit your goals.\n\n, Reread the things you have enjoyed and study them—figure out what makes them effective, what makes them work. Try to understand the structure of your favorite poem, or the evolution of the characters in your favorite novel. Find a sentence that you think is great, and wonder—why did that author choose that phrase? This word?\n\n\nDo not limit yourself single genres or fields. To truly enrich your writing experience, you must explore. You may not enjoy fantasy, but other people read and write fantasy for a reason. Read with this motto in mind: “I read to write. I read to learn. I read to be inspired.”\n\n, Notice things. Pay attention to the world around you. Look for mysteries and try to solve them. If you have questions, pursue the answers with obsessive interest. Take special note of the quirky and unusual. When writing, having noticed things will help give you something to write about. Moreover, it can help make your writing more compelling, richer, and more realistic. Here are some pointers that will help you explore the world around you:\n\n\nNothing is ordinary or boring. There’s something odd or special about everyone and everything.\nThere’s a mystery in front of you: a TV that won’t turn on, a bird that won’t fly. Figure out how things work, don’t work, and why.\nPay attention to detail. The leaves are not only green: they've got long, thin veins, rigid stems, and are shaped like spades.\n\n, Write down things that you notice or that inspire you. Take it everywhere you go. Some famous writers even went as far as to sew extra pockets into their jackets in order to carry more scraps of paper. Use this journal to produce ideas, take note of things you see, hear, or read, and flesh out your writing material. When you get stuck on your project, you can revisit it for inspiration. Understand that everything can go in your notebook, because everything is a source of inspiration. Some useful things are:\n\n\nDreams: a major source of the weird and unusual. Write it down before it disappears!\nPictures: photographs and doodles\nQuotes: things people say, sentences that surprise you, short poems, the insides of a fortune cookie\n\n, This is the most important part, and it can be very hard. Many of us stare blankly at the computer screen, with no words to write. Some call it “writers block.” To help, here are some basic writing exercises that can help jog your creative juices and provide a material for your project:\n\n\nGo somewhere busy, preferably a place with lots of people. Imagine that your vision of the scene is a video camera, recording everything. Take out your notebook and write down exactly what is happening. Include all the senses—sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.\nTake a voice recorder, and spy on a conversation. Don’t let the speakers know! After you've recorded for an adequate amount of time, transcribe the conversation on paper. Play with the words—delete things, change things, add things. Create a new setting, or a new situation.\nCreate a character. What do they want? Fear? What is their secret? Who are they related to, and where do they live? What’s their last name…if they even have one?\n\n, There are a billion half-novels in the world and a trillion half-short stories. Setting a goal and sticking to it, however unpleasant the work gets, is essential to figuring out what you want to write. By the time you finish whatever you set out to write in the first place, you’ll have three things:\n\na good idea what you really want to write about\nsome skill with which to write about it\nthe tenacity to finish the job\n\n, Sharing ideas and getting feedback is one of the best ways to become inspired and to improve your work. This can be scary for beginner writers, for your work can be something incredibly personal, and you may be afraid of rejection. However, writing in isolation means that not only is no one reading your work, but you can also run the risk of compounding bad habits (being too wordy, redundant, or melodramatic, etc.). Instead of being scared, think that every person you share your work with is a potential person to give you new ideas and inspire you.\n\n, Being a writer is almost like being a superhero: awkward office job by day… dragon-riding, super sleuth, knight in armor WRITER by night. Some creative writers do not have day jobs—but this is very rare. However, having a day job is not a bad thing. In fact, a good day job can even be helpful to your goal in becoming a writer. When finding your dream day job, here are some things to consider:\n\n\nDoes it pay the bills? A good day job should ease your financial burdens so you can write without worry. Stress is not conducive to your project.\nDoes it leave you enough time and energy to write? A good day job should be easy enough on your energy level so that you’re not exhausted afterwards.\nDoes it provide a good “distraction”? Having a space away from your writing work can be helpful. Spending too much time on a single project can be overly immersive. It is good to take a step back.\nDoes it have other creative people? A good day job should give you awesome coworkers. Creative people are everywhere! They are not just writers or artists.\n\n, No, don’t literally put them in handcuffs! Immerse them in your work. Suck them into the writing so that they will read and read and never want to escape, so that they will want you to handcuff them to your next book. To do this, here are some techniques you can use:\n\n\nThe senses. We perceive and experience the world through our senses. An immersive and convincing work will often have readers seeing, touching, tasting, hearing, and smelling.\nConcrete details. These types of details provide a specific sense of understanding of what is going on in the writing. Rather than generalizing an image—“she was pretty”—get specific: “She had long, golden braids, which were interwoven with daisies.”\n\n, If you are more familiar with something, you can write about it in more detail, realism, and depth. If you don’t know a detail that is important for your project, do research. Google it. Ask someone who knows. The more information you know about a situation, a person, or setting, the more you will be able to render it realistically on the page.\n\n, Sometimes, the best way to write a story is “Linear Structure”: Beginning, Climax, and Resolution. However, there are many, many other ways to write a story. Consider “In Media Res”—when the story begins in the thick of things. Or, a story interspersed by multiple flashbacks. Choose your structure depending on your story’s progression.\n\n, The 3 main categories are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Person. When deciding point of view, think about what information you want your readers to have access to.\n\n\n1st POV: uses \"I\"\n\ninvolved – narrator is an active player and teller of the story\ndetached – narrator is not telling their own story specifically, but maybe the story of a central character\nPlural (we) – a collective narrator, maybe a large group of people\n\n\n2nd POV: uses \"You\"\n\ninverted, the narrator is referring to him or herself as the writer, and perhaps dissociating themselves from distasteful thoughts/traits/memories\nYou = a character, distinct with their own unique qualities\nYou = direct address to the reader\nYou = reader is active character in the story\n\n\n3rd POV: uses a character name\n\nomniscient – narrator knows everything, has free reign in the story and complete authority, and can hurl judgments\nlimited – this POV is missing something. It is like a window of vision that gets smaller and smaller as you become more limited\nsingle characters’ thoughts and feelings -- Harry Potter is limited to Harry's thoughts and feelings\ndirect observer -- a narrator's telling of situation, but cannot explicitly discern the emotions of the characters\nfly on the wall--the narrator is spy, watching the situation from a distant perspective, but is not privy to everything for information is limited by the narrator's location on the wall\n\n\n\n, Simple is the best way to start. While you will undoubtedly need a well-stocked vocabulary (more on that later), too many big words will drive all but the most dedicated readers away. Start small. Don't hold onto a grandiose word just because it sounds fancy. Aim instead to allow everyone who reads your writing to comprehend exactly what you wanted them to comprehend. Nothing more, and nothing less.\n\n, Short sentences are easy to digest and are very readable. That's not to say that you can't, or shouldn't, write a long sentence every once in a while. It's just that simple sentences deliver information without stopping the reader in his or her tracks, stranding them on an island of befuddlement.\n\n\nTake a look at a notorious long, overwrought sentence. The following sentence won the satirical Bad Writing Contest second-prize. It's no secret why it qualifies as \"bad writing.\" The sentence is caked in jargon, riddled with imprecise catchphrases, and is way too long:\n\n\"If, for a while, the ruse of desire is calculable for the uses of discipline soon the repetition of guilt, justification, pseudo-scientific theories, superstition, spurious authorities, and classifications can be seen as the desperate effort to “normalize” formally the disturbance of a discourse of splitting that violates the rational, enlightened claims of its enunciatory modality.\", Verbs are the great drivers of sentences. They carry meaning from one thought to the next. On top of that, they help writers achieve dazzling degrees of precision.\n\n\nPay close attention to certain problem verbs. Verbs such as \"did,\" \"went,\" \"saw,\" \"felt,\" and \"had,\" while occasionally appropriate, don't really add any spice to your writing. Substitute a more specific word for problem verbs when appropriate: \"accomplished,\" \"skipped,\" \"gazed,\" \"experienced,\" and \"secure\" all communicate more specific ideas.\nUse the active voice instead of the passive voice, as a rule of thumb.\nActive voice: \"The cat found her master.\" Here, the cat is doing the work, so to speak. She is actively finding her master.\nPassive voice: \"The master is found by his cat.\" Here, the cat is more removed from the action. The master is being found; the cat isn't finding.\n\n\n\n, The beginning writer will go crazy with adjectives. There's nothing wrong with adjectives, except that they can sometimes be redundant and are often more obscure — and therefore harder to understand — than other parts of speech. Don't feel like you need to include an adjective before every noun in order to describe the noun.\n\n\nSometimes, adjectives are redundant. Take the sentence \"I watched as he lifted the last pawn and set it down, checkmating the king, clinching his successful victory.\" What victory isn't successful? Here, the adjective simply restates what we already know. It doesn't add anything to to help the reader comprehend what's going on.\nOther times, the adjectives writers use can be pretty obscure. \"He is a puissant adversary\" is a sentence that is neither accessible nor fitting. \"Puissant\" means powerful, and substituting \"powerful\" for \"puissant\" would have made the sentence both understandable and bearable.\n\n, Keep a dictionary and thesaurus by your side at all times. Whenever you come across a word that you don't know, look it up. It's hard to call yourself a writer if you're not at least marginally interested in etymology. At the same time, use your vocabulary sparingly. Just because you know the words \"defenestrate,\" \"pyknic,\" and \"agnomen\" doesn't mean you should be finding excuses to use them.\n\n\nStudy roots of words. Word roots (especially Latin roots for the English language) will help you decipher the meanings of unknown words without a dictionary. Knowing the roots mal-, ben-, epi-, eu-, ag-, and con- is a good start.\n\n, It's tempting for people who use words for a living to use them a little loosely. Often, when we're stuck and we don't know which word to use, we wing it and write down a word that's \"good enough.\" This strategy is useful and necessary in everyday conversation, but problematic in writing.\n\n\nFor one, there's no social context. The writer can't use his or her hands to gesture, and can't rely on facial expressions to steer the conversation toward clarity. The reader is all alone, and must rely solely on the words to gather meaning.\nSecond, the reader takes what the writer says at face value. The reader doesn't expect to have to ask the writer whether she meant what she wrote; the reader assumes that the writer meant what she wrote. The writer doesn't clarify confusing words, which means that if you write down a confusing word, the reader is left confused.\n\nFor these reasons, take the time to say what you mean. Figure out what you want to say before you say it. Be dogged about sniffing out the right word, even if it takes you time. A lot of sub-par writing is the refusal to fit the right word with an idea, not issues with plot or stylistic concerns.\n\n, Examples of figurative language are metaphor and simile. It's best to use metaphor and simile when you want to dramatize or draw the reader's attention to something specific. Like saying \"I love you,\" figurative language loses much of its power if used incessantly.\n\n, Good punctuation is neither seen nor heard, but is powerful nonetheless. Underuse punctuation and your readers won't be able to understand the meaning of your sentences. \"Let's eat, Mommy,\" and \"Let's eat Mommy\" have two very different meanings. Overuse punctuation and your readers will be distracted. No one wants to read a sentence in which colons, semicolons, and dashes make more appearances that actual words.\n\n\nExclamation points. Use exclamation points sparingly. People don't often exclaim things; nor do sentences often merit exclamation. Elmore Leonard, the great crime writer, has this to say: \"Keep your exclamation points under control. You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.\"\nSemicolons. Semicolons act as hybrid periods, connecting two sentences that have logical connection. Still, Kurt Vonnegut argues against them: \"Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.\"Although Vonnegut's assessment might be a little harsh, it's probably only good to use them from time to time.\n\n, Don't be afraid to invert rules or play with them to achieve the sort of writing you want. Some of the greatest writers have successfully broken grammatical, stylistic, and semantic rules, making literature better by doing so. Know why you're breaking the rule in the first place, and understand its likely effect. But if you're not willing to take some risks, what are you doing calling yourself a writer?\n\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_084", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nI want to begin by saying I'm a long time supporter of Samsung and their products. From TV's, washing machines, dishwashers, fridges, cords,headsets, and phones I have always stood by them. I am a registered Platinum Member in fact and I just want to make it clear I'm not bashing them in anyway and think they are handling this as best as they can however it is quite a shit show. \n (Feel free to go down to the exchange heading if you are only interested in that however I'd appreciate your time) \n \n Purchasing \n \n I purchased the phone day 2 in store (using Tmobiles old jump program as Im grandfathered into it) and was told it was gonna be mailed as it was out of stock in store. I had travel planned at the end of the coming week and wanted to have the phone for it. In the store I was told 4 business days tops and since it was a Friday and I wasn't leaving until the following Friday that I'd be fine. Trusting in this I opted against going and buying it outright somewhere else and having to deal with activating it. I checked my Tmobile account daily starting Saturday where I saw it said my note 5 was my \"trade device\" and then there was just nothing under the \"new device\" tab. I wasn't concerned figuring it had just went through no big deal. Sunday- nothing no change. Monday-no change and I was at this point figuring the site must have a bug and just not show it. Now I waited until Wednesday to check again seeing then that still no progress had been made. I had received an email the day prior with a tracking number but when I looked it up USPS said nothing was found. So now Thursday morning I decide that there must be a problem as nothing had changed. \n So I call in and the rep asks me for my account info and upon pulling it up she too cant see anything for my new device. She is apologetic but after 15minutes of her trying to get into the account she gives up and says she'll need her supervisor. I wait another 10 minutes and she comes back and says she still wasnt able to totally open the account however she can track it and says its at my local post office and out to be delivered. Great! I thank her and hangup. Where I live they don't deliver mail so when mail is being delivered it just means they are sorting it to your box so I head down to the post office.  I know the postman well and he says he hasn't got anything for me and checks the whole data base and nothing comes up.  So now I'm showing him the tracking number in the email tmobile sent me and he immediately sees that for whatever reason they doubled the numbers up and thats why it wasnt working so he checks the number and is able to tell me that not only have they not shipped it but not even gave it to USPS all they have done it print a label. So I return home and call again to find out why they told me it was shipped. The gentlemen I speak with tells me he's sorry and has no idea where this other agent got this info from. On top of that he's sorry to say that it wont probably ship for a few days still as its back ordered. I ask why no one told me and just get more sorrys. So fast forward to 3 days later I return and finally have the device. \n \n Ownership \n \n Now once I got it I had a little problem transferring my old data using the included connector and cord. Ended up using the old wireless system and synced quickly. Now I had no problems from here on out other than I noticed it got quite warm but I use fast charge battery packs as I'm on the go often so whatever I think nothing of it as my note 3 got warm way back when it had just came out. \n Fast forward to D-Day its top news every where that note 7's are bursting into flames. Shit. So I now begin to only charge while I'm watching it and in a metal bin whatever not a big deal however whats the plan what am I to do with the other 2 million people. \n I get that answer days later when a message is given that all retailers are gonna be issuing some sort of return process and give a loaner phone. Eh well okay at least they are taking care of me. Well not really days go by and I hear what some carriers are doing but nothing from T-Mobile hell not even an email from them that I have a recalled piece of equipment that is a possible hazard to my health. \n Finally I get an email from them that says I have 3 options. 1.sign up to be told when the new phone is ready 2.Switch to a new device totally forever or 3.Return for full refund \n I call in to see if I can exchange like I heard other carriers are doing for just a loaner phone. I'm given a resounding NO that I'd be at that point choosing option 3 and returning and that I'd be getting the loaner phone on my own dime and I could just hope that within the 14 day return period that I'd be able to get a new note 7. Ha no way. I'll just be careful with the phone. Now almost a week passes and I got the text from yesterday saying that now they are really gonna take care of me. This is quotation directly from the page..... \n \"We’re making it easy for you to exchange your Galaxy Note7 for free. \n Just head into one of our retail stores to exchange your device. We’ll take care of the rest. Or you can call us today at 1-844-275-9309. We’ll ship you any device of your choice in our inventory with free next business day shipping. You can keep it or use it as a “loaner” until the new Note7 is available.\" \n If it looks to good to be true... \n \n Exchange \n \n So after my past experiences there is no way in hell I'm calling in when I'm given the option to handle this in the store as they tend to be a lot more accountable when we are face to face. So I go in and have a group ahead of me in line browsing the store so I sit down on the side and wait. The female rep asks if anyone is here to pay a bill or anything like that, that'll be quick I say yeah I'm just here to exchange for my loaner phone from the note 7 program. She is visibly displeased and lets me know that its a 30 minute process. I say okay thats fine I can wait to which she says well the last one took 45 minutes I say okay thats still fine I can wait. 15 minutes pass and a manager comes from the back letting me know I need to just call in to handle this as the store isnt capable and hands me a paper with the number written down. I let him know that the message I received from T-Mobile said quite the opposite to which he says there is no way he can exchange it in store as the hotline has the only system that allows the process and tells me he's sorry but over the past few days they tried to do it in store and simply couldn't as they don't even have the stock of s7/s7 edges to give out loaner phones. \n I finish my errands return home and immediately call and get quickly connected to Amy. Amy is quite chipper and lets me know the process is quite simple and all I need to do is head in the store and I'll be taken care of with an exchange loaner device of my choice. I laugh and let her know what I was told and she becomes concerned and says there is no way that could have happened as, as soon as the store sees a note 7 they are too immediately exchange  for any device even if all they have is Iphones as its considered a liability and safety concern. So I tell her then please note this information exactly on my account and I'll head back in. She notes it all with policy numbers even and I drive back. \n Upon arriving the store is armed with different employees from earlier except the female rep running the counter. She immediately goes in the back bringing a new manager who asks me, \"How can I help you?\" I tell him the situation and how I was already here and he says that the number I was given is the only thing he can do to help me. I explain that this is not the case and that I have notes on my account that should explain it clearly. He checks and says that this is old information and is not what his District Officer advised him on. He offers I call from the store phone and just try again. I oblige and speak with John. John tells me within 30 seconds that I can just head into a store to get my loaner. I ask him if he could hold for just one moment and tell that to the T-Mobile manager sitting across from me. They now I kid you not go back and forth for 15minutes telling each other different policys and how each other are wrong. I'm nearly laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation as 2 reps of the same company tell each they don't know policy. He eventually hangs up and tells me he is sorry but these guys on the phone don't know what they are talking about as there \"system doesn't just have a magic loaner button\". I tell him I understand but what am I to do as I'm just getting the run around no matter what I do. He says the main problem is, that my note 7 when I got it had a tax charge as all things do when they leave the store. He says that there is no way for me to get a tax charge in there system therefore he cant give me anything as thatd be illegal. I tell him that I understand the predicament but uhh what do I do? He then tells me he's gonna try a few things with his other employee. They spend 20 minutes and get no where. He then says he is trying to contact the District Officer or someone higher up but it could take a while. Sure why not I can wait. 45 minutes go by and still nothing. Now they are just trying different things in the system and finally come up with a way to get me a new device. However its gonna use an upgrade and also is outside the \"hotline loaner program\" therefore I'm now not entitled to a note 7 when they come out but he says he can make it note but its not legally binding and he cant promise anything. Yeah no way so he says just try and call in again tonight. \n I leave defeated and as I'm driving home I pass Verizon. Out of curiosity I pull over and look up the location and call them. I speak with John and ask him what is the process for the note 7 debacle. He is very friendly and says that for now all his location is doing is giving full refunds and thats it. I come clean and tell him I'm not with Verizon but T-Mobile and tell him my situation. He asks which location did I go too. I tell him and sure enough he says he used to work there and that they are know as the \"idiots of the district who always call in and end up just throwing there hands in the air and give up\" Wow great. He then in detail explains to me what they should have done in the system as he knows it well when he worked there and I tell him the problem with taxes to which he replies should be a non problem as when they refund the first note 7 I should get a credit for the original tax. Nevertheless he tells me to go to this other T-Mobile location he was at and gives me employee names to speak with. I thank him and return home. \n Now I decide I'll attempt this hotline one final time. Dana picks up and listens to it all and says she is sorry I'm going through this and can't believe the disconnect from the stores and hotline. She though is able to actually send me a loaner over the phone and works with me to get all the info. She asks what phone I want to which I decide why not try an Iphone 6s+ as I havent had an Iphone since the original 5. So she confirms it all and I think back to a problem I've had in the past when I moved a few months ago. There was a wrong street number which I had called and had \"fixed\" twice in the past so I ask her what address she is sending to and of course its wrong. Jesus Christ, I tell her its wrong and she corrects it and the call concludes telling me to sign my EIP when it comes to my email. \n FINALLY this nightmare is over.... right? Well 2 hours pass and I get the email and sign it. And its now almost midnight, what a day. I get the final confirmation email and read it over. Yep you know it guess what was wrong??? The address. Still. Wrong. \n (I actually started writing this post at this point but got even more content to write lol) \nI'm now finally at my wits end, I've kept calm all day and been very understanding but now I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have a heart attack. I call its 12:02am and I speak with Ieasha who hears a very abbreviated gloss over the situation to which I tell her I just need the address fixed on my current shipment. Guess what no she cant. Once the EIP is signed it cant be canceled. She tries for 20minutes and has me explain the whole situation. She then says shes gonna have me talk to a supervisor who she has explained how crazy this has gotten. \n Kendall the head supervisor is now talking to me who says she is gonna put this to bed no matter what it takes right here and now. I tell her that this is my last call to T-Mobile as otherwise I will be going in and demanding full refunds and canceling my 5 year long account with them. I let her know the entire problem and go into detail with the exact disconnects I see between the stores and hotline. I tell her about how I had them even arguing over the phone on what policy was. I conclude the story with telling her that as the customer I have done my due diligence and that this is in her hands to get higher ups to hopefully fix this nightmare of a system. She admits her displeasure with how ridiculous this all is and even laughed at how stupid this must look. She reiterates that she cant cancel this order at this point and has tried. However she is gonna just credit me the entire cost of the Iphone and send it free. Even going as far as to sends case and screen protectors. She asks that I please call in the morning using Dana's direct line and have her deal with calling UPS to stop the shipment when they get it. She says that she'll not be working for 2 days but will make sure that its all dealt with when shes back to be sure there are no problems. She says to also hold my note 7 as collateral until they send me a note 7 in the future which they should call about in the coming weeks.  I thank her and finally set down my phone. \n Its 1am and I have two 800 dollar iphones, case, and screen protectors coming and it only costed me about 7 hours of calls and sitting in the store, a few gallons of gas, and about 98% of my patience. \n Morning comes and I call Dana's line as soon as she is supposed to be on duty as I have her hours for the next few days written down. No pickup. I call a few times over the next couple hours and finally decide to just call the note 7 hotline again and the rep sees the note on my account and says she will deal with UPS. \n So that's it not too bad right? I hope my slightly ticked demeanor is understood but this was the craziest experience in recalls I have ever dealt with. Worse than car recalls where I have had family get free cars worth over 20k once all was said and done. I write this to vent and also get the word out that there is a clear problem at T-Mobile that hopefully Kendall gets the word out about. I just want to make sure no one else deals with this and has better experiences. \n My final words are gonna be some lessons learned about this process: \n \n DO NOT LET ANYONE HAVE YOUR NOTE 7 wait until you have the new one confirmed being shipped to you or are being handed it in the store. \n \n Do not go into the store they can NOT help you and dont become upset with them for this as they simply lack the system to do so. \n \n Lastly document everything. Who you speak with. Where you go. Whats happening even. Its the best way to cover yourself as this process is being developed. \n \n \n I now am just waiting for my Iphone and hoping that it all works out and I dont end up getting charged anything after this all but I'm sure this story will only get crazier when its time to get my  replacement. We shall see. \n Thanks for your time. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1. Identify the main topic and primary arguments presented in the article.\n2.

Soon after, news broke of Note 7 batteries catching fire, prompting the author to cautiously charge the phone while supervised.\n\nT-Mobile's initial communication regarding the recall was lacking, failing to inform the customer of the hazard and offering limited options: a refund, switch to a new device permanently, or wait for a replacement Note 7.  \n\nThe author opted to exchange the device for a loaner, but faced numerous roadblocks:\n\n* Inconsistent information from T-Mobile representatives, both in-store and over the phone, about loaner device availability and the exchange process.\n* Repeated store visits resulting in wasted time and conflicting information from T-Mobile employees.\n\nOne employee even suggested the author call the hotline from within the store, leading to a bizarre back-and-forth between the store manager and a phone representative, both claiming the other was wrong about policy.\n\nDesperate for a solution, the author contacted a Verizon representative who, despite not being a current customer, offered helpful advice and insight into the recall process.\n\nEventually, after hours of calls and store visits, a T-Mobile supervisor intervened, ultimately sending the author a free iPhone 6s+ (originally intended to be a loaner) to compensate for the inconvenience.\n\nThis \"victory\" was short-lived, as the author discovered the wrong address was listed for the iPhone shipment, requiring yet another call to rectify the situation.\n\nThe author concludes by warning readers about potential pitfalls in the recall process:\n\n* Not surrendering the Note 7 until a replacement is confirmed.\n* Avoiding in-store exchanges due to systemic issues.\n* Meticulously documenting every interaction with T-Mobile representatives.\n\nThe author's experience highlights a significant breakdown in communication and customer service during a high-stakes product recall.\n\nThe post serves as a cautionary tale for other Note 7 owners, urging them to be prepared for potential challenges and advocate for their rights as consumers. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "summarization_085", "instruction": "You're a professional researcher. Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nlarge space - time volumes with the highest energy density to date , over 15 gev/@xmath1 in typical estimates@xcite , have been produced in @xmath2 gev au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite . at such high energy densities ,\nstrongly interacting matter is predicted to be in a phase commonly referred to as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .\na goal of the rhic program is to study this phase in the extended systems created in relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei .\nthe presence of qgp manifests itself in the equation of state , which ( together with the initial conditions ) determines various measured properties and serves as an input to fluid - dynamical calculations .\nit is reasonable to expect that , barring calculational problems , the main features of the equation of state can be probed by comparing fluid - dynamically calculated quantities to data . it has been argued recently that the quark - gluon matter produced in 200  gev central au+au collisions behaves as a perfect fluid with negligible viscosity@xcite . this conclusion was based in part on the agreement @xcite of the flow quantity @xmath3 ( see eqs .\n( [ fourier ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) for a definition ) in central au+au with the prediction of an ideal - fluid calculation @xcite .\nthe data seem to indicate that the systems produced in 200  gev central au+au collisions have just reached a large enough energy density in a sufficient space - time volume for the approximate agreement with the fluid - dynamical results .\nif energy density could be increased even further , a crucial test would be whether @xmath3 continues to grow , or whether it saturates at the value for an ideal fluid .\na promising avenue to increase the energy density and/or increase the volume of high - density matter without any increase in beam energy is to collide heavy deformed ( prolate ) nuclei .\nthis has been proposed by several theorists @xcite .\ncentral collisions with the long axes aligned with the beam ( we call this the tip - to - tip configuration , as in ref .  @xcite ) would be the most desired configuration\n. however , as long as no beams of aligned deformed nuclei are available @xcite , the desired configurations have to be selected by experimenters using some combination of triggering and offline event selection .\nrecently , heinz and kuhlman advocated the use of full - overlap collisions between deformed uranium nuclei @xcite .\nthe selection of full - overlap collisions using zero - degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) was examined in ref .\n@xcite . however , various fluctuations and background signals in the detectors mean that an event sample with the lowest zdc signal will still include a substantial fraction of collisions in which full overlap did not occur\n. in this work , we address these issues with the help of data on the relevant performance of the star detector @xcite .\nthe paper is organized as follows : in sec .\n[ calc ] we briefly review the relevant quantities and outline our calculation , while in sec .\n[ res ] , we present results without and with detector smearing . in sec .\n[ concl ] , we briefly summarize our findings .\nthe elliptic flow anisotropy @xmath4 , defined as the second fourier coefficient in the expansion = a [ fourier ] of the azimuthal distribution @xmath5 of final state particles is a sensitive measure of the success of fluid - dynamical models .\nbased on suggestions in refs .\n@xcite it has become customary to consider @xmath3 , the elliptic flow scaled by the initial spatial eccentricity @xcite = .\n[ epsilon ] the normalization by @xmath6 emphasizes that the final momentum anisotropy is driven by the initial geometry .\none advantage of using @xmath3 is that the impact - parameter dependence is largely removed from its fluid - dynamically calculated value .\nthis quantity is frequently plotted against the transverse particle density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the multiplicity of charged particles per unit rapidity and s =   [ area ] is the transverse area of the overlap zone weighted by the number of wounded nucleons @xcite .\nthe transverse particle density @xmath7 can be interpreted as a measure of the initial entropy density in the transverse plane @xcite .\nan increase in this quantity means increased particle production , and is thus associated with an increase in energy density in the system .\nthe charged particle multiplicity per unit rapidity @xmath8 can be increased by increasing the number of binary collisions , achievable by tip - to - tip collisions of heavy deformed nuclei .\nfurthermore , the u+u tip - to - tip configuration has about the same overlap area @xmath9 as au+au collisions at @xmath0 , and thus contributes to a further increase in @xmath7 beyond what would be obtained with hypothetical spherical nuclei of the same mass as uranium . on the other hand , for @xmath0 collisions , @xmath9 increases by @xmath10 24% between au+au and u+u when the latter are in the body - to - body orientation , i.e. , when the long axes of the nuclei are parallel to each other , but perpendicular to the beam .\nthus it can be concluded that even in the experimentally unrealistic limit where full - overlap u+u collisions can be isolated , it is necessary to also distinguish between different full - overlap configurations in order to realize the full potential advantage of u+u collisions .\nthe rhic data as a function of @xmath7 reach the perfect - fluid value of @xmath11 in the most central 200 gev au+au collisions at around @xmath12  @xmath13 .\nsince viscosity would decrease the predicted @xmath3 , it would be difficult for a fluid - dynamical model to be reconciled with any further increase in the observed ratio @xmath3 .\nthus , the behavior of this ratio at significantly larger @xmath7 should prove informative in assessing the applicability of fluid dynamics in central collisions at rhic .\nuranium ( @xmath14u ) beams have been proposed as a way to increase @xmath7 @xcite .\nwe assume in this study that , in order to isolate a sample of u+u collisions with the maximum possible @xmath7 , the best available experimental procedure is to select events where the fewest possible spectator neutrons are detected ( low zdc signal ) in coincidence with the highest observed multiplicity of produced particles in a broad region centered on mid -

in this section , we estimate the characteristics of a class of events intended to have the highest experimentally obtainable enrichment of the desired tip - to - tip configurations .\nwe assume that this is carried out by selecting events with the highest charged particle multiplicity in a broad @xmath35 region centered on midrapidity , and simultaneously cutting to select events with a low signal in both zero degree calorimeters .\nthe measured @xmath41 in a detector like star is linearly correlated with the true @xmath41 , but is subject to random event - to - event fluctuations in the efficiency for detecting tracks as well as random variations in the inclusion rate for tracks that do not originate from the primary collision vertex .\nsimilarly , the zdc signals have a component that is proportional to the number of emitted spectator neutrons as well as a component from various sources of background .\nfurthermore , the rhic intersection regions are arranged such that the zdcs have acceptance for only free neutrons and an insignificantly small fraction of neutron - rich charged spectator fragments .\nthus while we compute the total number of spectator nucleons in a given event using our monte carlo glauber model , in real collisions at star , only a subset of the spectators are detected by the zdcs , and so events with a small zdc signal include a high background level of collisions with incomplete overlap .\nthe upper panel of fig .\n[ fig : zdcvsmult ] shows contours of event density in the plane of spectator count versus @xmath41 from our monte carlo glauber model without any detector simulation .\nthe resulting correlation is much narrower than what is observed in experiment @xcite , an expected outcome given the simplicity of the model and the neglect of the experimental effects discussed above . to make a realistic estimate of the best enrichment of tip - to - tip u+u collisions that might be achieved ,\nit is necessary to smear out the narrow ridge in the upper panel of fig .\n[ fig : zdcvsmult ] so that a pattern resembling the experimental distribution is obtained . for this purpose ,\na gaussian - distributed random number is first added to @xmath41 for each event , such that the steeply dropping upper tail of the @xmath41 distribution in fig .\n[ fig : mult - no - smear ] is smeared out to the point where it resembles the experimental distribution from star . the smeared multiplicity distribution is shown in fig .\n[ fig : mult - smeared ] .\nnote that we are concerned here with the upper end of the multiplicity distribution ( highest values of @xmath41 ) , and the variation of the smearing at lower multiplicities is not of interest .\nnext , another gaussian - distributed random number ( with non - zero mean ) is added to the spectator count and the result is used as the simulated zdc signal .\nthe gaussian mean and width are adjusted to produce a ridge near the lower right part of the lower panel of fig .\n[ fig : zdcvsmult ] that resembles the observed data from star @xcite .\nthis procedure has a small effect on the agreement of the calculation with the phobos data shown in fig .\n[ fig : knpar ] , and while the effect is minimal , we corrected for the difference .\nvarious combinations of cuts in @xmath41 and in zdc signal have been applied to the simulated u+u data plotted in the lower panel of fig .\n[ fig : zdcvsmult ] with the objective of maximizing the transverse particle density @xmath7 . because the quantity we seek to maximize is trivially correlated with one of our cut variables ,\nwe assess the maximum particle density in u+u collisions relative to au+au collisions with the same cuts on a percentage basis .    the vertical axis in fig .\n[ fig : lego ] shows the ratio @xmath54_{\\rm uu }   / [ ( 1/s)\\ , dn_{ch}/dy]_{\\rm auau}$ ] as a function of independent scans across both cut variables .\nnote the zero - suppressed vertical axis ; we conclude that no further increase in @xmath54_{\\rm uu}$ ] beyond about 18% relative to au+au can be reached in the context of our simulation , even searching beyond the plotted combinations of cuts on @xmath41 and zdc signal . in the region of the most selective combination of centrality cuts , the advantage of u+u is about 16% .\nfigure  [ fig : diff_energy ] summarizes the measured progression in the maximum @xmath7 for central pb+pb or au+au collisions , beginning with a low sps beam energy and continuing to the highest rhic energy . on the same number line , we indicate that when our simulation for au+au is constrained to agree well with the value from the star collaboration , we predict a potential further increase of about 4 @xmath13 for u+u with the same centrality cut .\nthe calculated value of @xmath7 is larger than the star result for au+au at 200 gev because of different parameterization of the nuclear radius and small uncertainties in the number of wounded nucleons .\nhowever , this has a negligible effect on the relative increase from au+au to u+u .\nwe have undertaken a study of the potential for u+u collisions to realize an increased transverse particle density @xmath55 without increasing the beam energy .\nwe note that the present investigation addresses only a limited aspect of u+u collisions , namely , we have studied the  worst case scenario \" where only the transverse particle density @xmath55 is of interest , and where the charged particle multiplicity and the zero - degree calorimeter signals are the only means of selecting the desired u+u events .\nprevious studies have considered the issue of the path - dependent energy loss of partons in the unique participant geometry of central u+u collisions @xcite , and it is feasible for u+u collisions to extend our physics reach in a variety of observables .    the transverse particle density increases by about 35% in the ideal limit of tip - to - tip u+u collisions compared to au+au at zero impact parameter .\nhowever , the practical limitation of selecting the u+u samples of interest via conventional measures of centrality , as used in rhic experiments , leads to uranium beams offering a smaller , yet still - worthwhile advantage .\nspecifically , our simulations suggest that the maximum achievable values of @xmath55 at rhic could be increased from the present @xmath56 @xmath13 to about 35 @xmath13 with u+u collisions .\nthis increase should justify the needed investment of effort and resources at rhic , being of the same order as the measured increase for central au+au collisions when the beam energy was increased from @xmath57 = 130 gev to 200 gev , or just under half the increase between the top cern sps energy and @xmath57 = 130 gev .\nwe thank ulrich heinz , anthony kuhlman , and peter levai for extensive discussions .\none of the authors ( gf ) acknowledges the support of a szent - gyrgyi scholarship of the hungarian department of education and the hospitality of the etvs university , where some of this work was carried out . this work was supported in part by us doe grants de - fg02 - 86er40251 and de - fg02 - 89er40531 .\n99 m.  gyulassy and l.  mclerran , nucl .\na * 750 * , 30 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : nucl - th/0405013 ] .\ni.  arsene _ et al . _\n[ brahms collaboration ] , nucl .\nphys .  a * 757 * , 1 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : nucl - ex/0410020 ] .\nk.  adcox _ et al . _\n[ phenix collaboration ] , nucl .\nphys .  a * 757 * , 184 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : nucl - ex/0410003 ] .\nb.  b.  back _ et al .\n_ , nucl .\nphys .  a * 757 * , 28 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : nucl - ex/0410022 ] .\nj.  adams _ et al . _ [ star collaboration ] , nucl .\nphys .  a * 757 * , 102 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : nucl - ex/0501009 ] .\nf.  karsch , prog .\nsuppl .   * 153 * , 106 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : hep - lat/0401031 ] . t.  hirano and m.  gyulassy , arxiv : nucl - th/0506049 . m.  j.  tannenbaum , arxiv : nucl - ex/0603003 .\np.  f.  kolb , j.  sollfrank and u.  w.  heinz , phys .\nc * 62 * , 054909 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0006129 ] .\ne.  v.  shuryak , phys .\nc * 61 * , 034905 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : nucl - th/9906062 ] .\nb.  a.  li , phys .\nc * 61 * , 021903 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : nucl - th/9910030 ] .\nu.  w.  heinz and a.  kuhlman , phys .\nlett .   * 94 * , 132301 ( 2005 ) .\nd.  fick , j.  phys .\n( paris ) colloq .\n* c6 * , 265 ( 1990 ) .\na.  j.  kuhlman and u.  w.  heinz , phys .\nc * 72 * , 037901 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : nucl - th/0506088 ] .\nk.  h.  ackermann _ et al .\n_ [ star collaboration ] , nucl .\ninstrum .\na * 499 * , 624 ( 2003 ) ;

", "response": "\n\n\n\nThis paper investigates the potential of uranium-uranium (u+u) collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to produce a higher transverse particle density than gold-gold (au+au) collisions at the same energy. This higher density would allow scientists to probe the properties of quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter thought to have existed in the early universe, with greater precision.\n\nThe authors use a Glauber model, which simulates the geometry and particle production in heavy-ion collisions, to estimate the transverse particle density achievable for different scenarios of u+u collisions. They consider several factors, including the orientation of the uranium nuclei during the collision and the selection criteria for experimental data. \n\nTheir findings suggest that while ideal tip-to-tip u+u collisions could achieve a 35% increase in transverse particle density compared to au+au collisions, realistic selection methods based on multiplicity and zero-degree calorimeter signals would limit the increase to about 16%. Even with this limitation, u+u collisions offer a valuable opportunity to increase the transverse particle density by approximately 18% compared to the current maximum achievable with au+au collisions.\n\nThis achievable density increase is comparable to the increase observed when the beam energy was raised from 130 GeV to 200 GeV at RHIC, highlighting the potential impact of u+u collisions on heavy-ion physics research. The authors conclude that the potential benefits of u+u collisions justify the necessary investments in adapting RHIC for these new experiments.\n"}
{"id": "summarization_086", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nSo, little background, I've been playing since closed Beta, mostly FTP player (bought the Adventures + 1 Arena in Beta for the golden Legendary), and because of that, I gravitated toward Arena because it was the best way to enjoy all the cards of the game I couldn't craft.  Even though I now have every card in the game, I still enjoy playing arena more than constructed.  I average about 6.5 wins/run and 140ish gold/run, so I'm basically infinite since I play 1 run a day, and quest gold kicks me over 150/day.  I often watch Arena streams and pay attention to Arena threads, and one common theme that's agreed upon in Arena is that Warrior sucks.  If you go to any site that tracks Arena win rates, Warriors are always at the bottom in win rates and percent picked.  Pretty much every Arena streamer agrees that Warrior is far and away the worst class.  Not that there aren't strong cards, but more that many of the cards don't lend themselves well to the Arena format.  With the new expansion soon to be released, I figured I'd analyze the class and everything about it to point out the many flaws of the class, and what I would want as cards to deal with these flaws. \n Warning: Long \n \n The Arena Meta \n \n To understand why Warriors are bad in Arena, you have to understand Arena itself.  In Constructed, decks are built from the ground up to synergize with each other.  This is what makes combo decks or slower decks viable.  Control and Patron Warrior are two examples of it, with Patron Warrior being arguably the most synergistic deck in Hearthstone, and Control Warrior relying on cheap removal and a copious amount of life gain, plus complete board wipes like Brawl, to get to the late game where it drops down big minion after big minion to the point it just overpowers other decks.  In Arena, these decks are impossible to create reliably.  While good players draft for synergy, its impossible to have the synergy required for constructed decks. \n As a result, Arena is primarily about Tempo and Value over the combo synergy in constructed.  The best cards to draft in Arena are cards that are very strong for their mana cost, which have the ability to gain value by either trading well and killing two or more cards by being played (a 2 for 1), or cards that can \"trade up\", allowing you to cheat tempo by using a 1 or 2 mana creature to kill a three or four mana creature.  A card like Piloted Shredder, for instance, can often kill one creature by itself, then it spawns another body which can then kill another creature, gaining a 2 for 1 value.  A card like Dark Iron Dwarf allows you to use your cheaper creatures to kill more expensive creatures, thus making your board state stronger than the opponent.  Flamestrike, the most hated card in Arena due to how often you can't play around it, often will kill 4 or 5 cards for 1 card, creating a huge value swing and allowing the Mage class to win through superior card value. \n Ultimately, the Warrior class cards for the most part fails to have these kinds of cards.  Warriors have many cards which all have a strong synergy with each other, arguably more synergy than any other class in constructed, but in Arena where this synergy is unreliable, you will often end up with inferior decks, that will very easily lose to other decks.  While the Warrior class certainly has strong cards, the vast majority of Warrior cards are heavily situational.  This hurts because, as arena is based on tempo, if I can not use my mana to do something to the board, and the opponent can, I will often lose the game.  Having situational cards that are often dead cards makes this much more likely to happen.  That many of these cards even when they can be used properly will not cause two for one trades makes them that much worse.  Even the Warrior hero power is inferior to all other classes' hero power in arena, which exacerbates their weakness in the format.  The rest of this post will describe just how exactly the Warrior class has problems generating value or tempo from its cards and hero power, and what I feel are the best steps to take in future card releases to fix this problem.. \n \n The Hero Power \n \n Blizzard initially created the hero powers to be something that players could do with their excess mana, as well as ways to define each class.  Of all classes in Arena, Warrior has unquestionably the worst hero power in the game (+2 armor), by a large, large margin.  This is because their hero power is almost completely irrelevant to what happens in the game.  Any time a Warrior has to hero power, it is going to put them behind further, compared to other class.  Analyzing the other classes: \n Two classes add minions to the board (Paladin, Shaman).  Three classes (Druid, Mage, Rogue) have hero powers that deal damage to the board.  Impacting the board in any way contributes to board control, which is more than Armor does. \n Warlock uses its hero power to draw cards.  The more cards you have, the more you can put on the board, and the more answers you have to the opponent's minions. \n Priest has a similar hero power to warrior, but they can also heal minions, which is much more valuable than the ability to go over 30 health (which is almost never relevant in Arena), or the ability to Shield Slam (more later).  This often lets priests in the mid to late game make two or more for one trades with their cards, allowing the Priest to gain a card advantage over other classes. \n Hunter's hero power is the only one outside of warrior which doesn't actually impact the board state, but it is more valuable as a clock for how long the game goes.  The Hunter hero power makes games shorter, while the Warrior hero power makes games last longer.  With no board, a Hunter can still win the game, while with no board, a Warrior will only delay the game longer until they lose or possibly come back. \n How to fix this: There should be more cards where Armor matters.  As of right now, there are two cards in the game which the hero power can impact: One is Shield Slam, a 1 mana epic which deals minion damage based on the armor you have, but due to a lack of armor synergy in Arena, its effectively a drain life 99% of the time.  The other is Siege Engine, a 5 mana rare 5/5 which gains 1 attack each time you gain armor.  Both of these cards are mediocre in Arena, because the main cards which generate armor are generally not all that good as its hard to get the right synergy to use them right, and the effects are not that powerful.  Shield Slam is usually a Drain Life when it gets used, which is pretty poor vaue.  Also, by being an Epic and Rare card respectively, it means that its that much harder for the hero power to get value.  There are other cards that rely on health instead of armor for triggers, but they can be ignored for Arena, even the class cards. \n To get value out of the hero power, you need more cards which impact the board when you use your hero power.  As you need to keep constructed in mind, any card that uses total armor would be a bad idea due to how absurdly high constructed armor can get, and how low arena armor usually is.  I think the best option would be to make a Warrior version of Shadowboxer or Flamewaker, dependent on when you gain armor.  I'd say a 2-4 mana minion that deals 1 random damage to an enemy minion every time you gain armor.  The mid-ranged ping effect would be useful in coming back from behind, or setting up an execute if you have the card. \n \n Warrior Spells \n \n Anyone who has played Warrior in constructed, Control or Patron, knows how well Warriors can have spells synergize with each other.  The problem is, as Arena is much more tempo and minion based, and because you can only build your deck on what you get, that often you will get spells or pieces that don't have good synergy, or are stuck in your hand as you wait to get the pieces together to make full use out of the Spells.  If you choose to take many of the Warrior spells, there's a good chance it'll either be a dead card for most of the game, or an ok card that really isn't worth the card slot, or gains card or tempo value.  Going over the various Warrior spells, from good to bad: \n Execute, Slam, Cleave: Awesome spells, real high value for their mana costs. \n Battle Rage, Commanding Shout: Good spells, if you have the right board they win games, but at their worst they're not that bad of cards.  Often cards you want to hold for the right play, so situational in spite of their upside. \n Brawl: Special tier by itself, its a dead card unless the opponent plays into it, and is only useful if you're behind on board.  It either wins you games or sits in your hand the entire game. \n Upgrade, Inner Rage, Revenge, Whirlwind, Rampage: Situational cards that are sometimes useful but aren't really high enough impact to be worth a card slot, or where its difficult to get the card combos to work. \n Mortal Strike, Shield Block, Shield Slam, Heroic Strike: Card that are really not all that powerful.  Special mention to Heroic Strike in that, it is good damage for mana, but because you always want a weapon, its often overkill, which is why I slot it here. \n Bouncing Blades, Charge: Bad cards, will rarely work as they should. \n So, of spells, Warrior has (IMO) 3 great, 2 good, one super high variance, 5 ok to poor, 4 bad, 2 very bad. \n How to fix this: Blizzard apparently already knew about this problem, because many of the Warrior spells have their effects on other cards.  Inner Rage on Cruel Taskmaster, Whirlwind on Death's Bite, along with Dread Infernal and Unstable Ghoul for non-warrior cards, and Shield Block's armor on Shield Maiden.  Warrior minions which gave you the Rampage or Upgrade effects would be nice so you could get those effects, but the spells are always going to be options to draft, and will always drag down your drafts because they'll take up options from better cards.   There is really no way to fix that issue. \n My best thought on how to address the issue of warrior spells being poor would be to add a \"Mad Scientist\" card for warriors, which draws specifically Warrior spells from your deck into the hand.  In this case, you could deal with the situational nature of the cards by having them in your hand, so if they are dead you can still have other cards to play.  The best Warrior runs I've had were runs where I had a lot of card draw to be able to play a lowish mana tempo game and not run out of steam, so more card draw for Warriors would help them.  This would obviously be very powerful in constructed, but I'm not sure if it'd be good enough in Patron/Control warrior to justify a card slot. \n \n Warrior Minions \n \n I would argue that, from a minion quality perspective, Warrior has the weakest selection of minions in the game.  Every class except for Druid has a common or rare minion that either is very hard to remove off the board efficiently (Imp Gang Boss, Minibot, Highmane), has a strong impact on the board when its played (Fire Elemental, Goblin Autobarber, Aldor Peacekeeper), or has absurdly strong stats for its cost (Water Elemental, Dark Cultist, Fireguard Destroyer).  Warrior has two cards that can be game winning, but they are dependent a lot on the board state, and aren't that difficult to remove.  Again, going over the cards: \n Frothing Berserker, Warsong Commander: Lumped in cause they can win games by themselves as any constructed player knows, although in different ways.  They're both cards you need to protect to get real strong value out of though. \n Cruel Taskmaster: Tier by itself, its a good card cause its versatile, but its either a worse Abusive Sergeant, or a better Elven Archer.  Its a 2 drop you never want to play on 2 even if useful. \n Korkron Elite: Also by itself, a 4/3  with charge for 4 is ok, its not bad, but its only really good when going face.  3 health on 4 is underwhelming, 4 damage removal on 4 is underwhelming, and it feels wasted trying to get a 2 for 1 value by killing a small minion. \n Shieldmaiden, Siege Engine, Warbot: Two ok minions and one minion that never works and ruins topdecks, that are inferior to the higher tiered 1/5/6 drops you'd get from neutral cards.  Again, class cards that are worse than at least 3 other neutral common minions. \n Armorsmith, Screwjank Clunker, Axe Flinger: Bad stats on the cards for their mana cost.  Axe Flinger makes me think Blizzard wants Warrior to suck in Arena because, I do not think there's any way, shape, or form a 3/5 Axe Flinger is broken or any more broken than what goes on anyways in constructed.  Screwjank would be better if it had Houndmaster stats because then it could do more damage and trade better, but at 2/5  just doesn't clear enough to be useful. \n How to fix this: Well to start, make Axe Flinger a 3/5, but Blizzard won't do that.  Warrior needs a stand alone minion that is very OP and can anchor their early game.  They need their own version of Minibot or Imp Gang Boss or Animal Companion.  In the other sections, I mentioned my ideas for a Warrior version of Flamewaker or Shadowboxer, or for more warrior minions like Cruel Taskmaster which incorporate Warrior spells into the minion to get value of of strong cards that just are too situational or not strong enough to justify a deck spot. \n In addition to these cards, other useful cards would be cards that either stall out the game, or deal AoE ping damage (like Foe Reaper 9000) would be really useful for early game board control and coming back from poor starts.  Random ideas I had were a 3 mana 1/5 or 2/4 taunt, every time a minion attacks this minion, deal 1 additional damage to it.  It would be basically a 2/5 or 3/4 taunt, with added upside, which would not be game-breaking in constructed, and slow down Arena for Warriors to parlay their Value edge.  Additionally, if you wanted to make it super-strong, you could make it deal 1 damage before a minion attacks into it, which would clear off divine shields/prevent minions with 1 HP from attacking it, but I think that effect might be so strong Blizzard would stat it as a 2/3, which would suck and make it worthless. \n Another one would be either a 4 mana 2/4 or 5 mana 3/5 with charge, and dealing 1 damage to adjacent minions on attack.  A little slower, but a way for Warriors to come back in the mid-game and set up executes or easier weapon clears, while again not being game-breaking in constructed.  As another taunt idea, a 4-6 mana creature that deals 1 damage to all other characters every time it takes damage would be another nice control card for Warriors, plus the ability proc Enrage effects easier. \n \n Warrior Weapons \n \n The class defining feature of Warriors.  Warrior has the most value-efficient weapons in the game, and often an entire Arena run for Warriors is predicated on if they draft weapons, and if they draw their weapons on the right turn.  There is a reason that Fiery War Axe is commonly called Fiery Win Axe, and that's because if you get it in your opening hand, you generally kill two of your opponent's minions for one, and that early game value edge will win you games similar to Minibot killing multiple minions.  Gorehowl may be the best value card in the game, Death's Bite is very strong due to its deathrattle, Arcanite Reaper is a 2 turn pyroblast for half the cost, and Arathi Weaponsmith allows you to put a minion on the board while getting rid of pesky little creatures to truly control the board.  All of the Warrior weapons are great.  All 5 of them.  The weapons were so strong that pre-GvG, while Warrior was not the best class, it was certainly a good class in Arena and not dreadful to pick.  So, what happened when GvG came out? \n Piloted Shredder happened.  Annoy-o-tron happened.  Shielded Minibot happened.  Coghammer happened.  Snowchugger happened.  Spider Tank and Ogre Brute happened.  Even Gilblin Stalker happened.  Then Imp Gang Boss happened in BRM.  In short, GvG improved the minion quality so much that having an early-game War Axe or Death's Bite wasn't strong enough to clear these minions, meaning the tempo Warriors needed wasn't there. \n On top of this, Warriors have gotten nothing in GvG or BRM.  Every other class except Druid got a great card from BRM which made them vastly stronger in Arena, and Warriors got crap.  Every class got at least something cool in BRM, and Warriors got crap outside of the occasional Patron, which if you've ever done Patron Warrior in Arena, you know that it just doesn't work, because its not consistent enough to get the combos off and not have dead cards. \n This doesn't account for the one major problem with weapons: Having too many of them.  As a Warrior, your best cards are weapons, and you pretty much need to always have one equipped or ready to equip to keep control of the board.  However, once you get to 5-7 weapons, you get to the point where you will have games where your hand is full of good weapons you can't use.  If I draft 4 mini-bots as a Paladin, I can put down a minibot if I already have one in play.  If I draft 4 War Axes, and I get 3 in my opening hand, I'm probably skipping a turn and losing the game cause of that.  So, even the real strong value cards of Warriors have drawbacks attached to them. \n How to fix this: Any card that summons/buffs weapons would obviously be useful to Warriors and make them more consistent.  Unstable Weaponsmith as a spell would be interesting to get a turn 4 Gorehowl, although this might be too strong since there are very few really bad weapons.  (Ogre Warmaul does not exist)  Warrior itself doesn't necessarily need more weapons, but because of how valuable the weapons are to the class, more options to get weapons would really help the class for Arena stability. \n While deathrattle and higher health minions serve to make the game more about minion trading and less about removal, due to Warrior's weakness, a powerful silence effect would be very useful to dealing with the deathrattle creatures that screw up Weapon's removal ability.  I would love to see the Shattering Throw ability come into Hearthstone, best as a 3 mana spell to Silence, then deal 3 damage to an enemy minion.  Its an upscaled Earth Shock, but it would be very, very strong in the early game.  It'd deal with Harvest Golem and Scarlet Crusader for the same value, trade up against Piloted Shredder, trade down against Minibot and Annoy-o-tron but still be worthwhile, and set up weapon kills on bigger minions like Sludge Belcher.  Plus, it'd be a tiny bit of spell damage to deal with minions like Zap-o-matic or Flesheating Ghoul or Questing Adventuer or Micro Machine that, if protected by taunts, flat out win games with little interaction. \n The only way I can see dealing with the glut of weapons is to find more ways to get use out of weapons.  Giving warriors a Hellfire/Bladefury like effect, to destroy your weapon and deal that damage to all minions, would be a strong AoE for Warriors, maybe a little too similar to brawl, but would give Warriors a board clearing AOE they need to come back if they start slow.  Another idea would be a spell to give Warriors Windfury for one turn.  If you set this at 3 mana, it would be a real strong removal tool, while at the same time not being that OP for Warriors, and justify having more weapons since you could get rid of them in one turn.  With a Fiery War Axe, you're paying 3 mana for 3 damage: Death's Bite is 3 mana for a swipe which hits the whole board, and Arcanite is 3 mana for a Kill Command.  It wouldn't be that OP for OTK weapon builds when you consider that Shaman has access to Windfury already (Spell + Doomhammer), plus a better buff option in Rockbiter Weapon. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

The author, a seasoned Arena player, argues that Warrior's design, particularly its reliance on situational cards and a subpar hero power, makes it struggle in the fast-paced, tempo-driven environment of Arena.\n\nThe author contrasts Warrior's weaknesses with the strengths of other classes, emphasizing how classes like Mage and Rogue excel at generating card advantage through powerful spells and efficient removal.  \n\nThe post focuses on several key issues plaguing the Warrior class:\n\n* **Hero Power:** The author argues that Warrior's hero power (+2 armor) is largely irrelevant in Arena, providing minimal impact on the board compared to other hero powers that deal damage, draw cards, or summon minions. They suggest introducing more cards that synergize with armor, possibly a minion that deals random damage whenever the player gains armor.\n\n* **Spells:** Many Warrior spells, while powerful in Constructed, are too situational for Arena's limited deck building. The author proposes solutions like a \"Mad Scientist\" card specific to Warriors, which draws Warrior spells from the deck, allowing for better control over hand composition.\n\n* **Minions:**  The author highlights the lack of strong, reliable early-game minions for Warriors. They suggest the introduction of a strong, standalone minion akin to Minibot or Imp Gang Boss to address this weakness.\n\n* **Weapons:** While Warrior weapons are powerful, they can become problematic when multiple copies fill the hand, leading to dead cards. The author suggests cards that enhance weapon synergy, potentially a spell that summons a weapon or a new ability to destroy a weapon for board damage.\n\nThe author concludes by emphasizing the need for Warrior-specific cards that address these weaknesses, allowing the class to compete effectively in Arena. They propose innovative card ideas and highlight the importance of balancing those changes with the existing Constructed format. \n\n"}
{"id": "summarization_089", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nLetter\nBusinesses of any size can be unsuspecting victims of tax fraud  schemes, including business identity theft refund fraud (business IDT).  According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), business IDT occurs  when thieves create, use, or try to use a business’s identifying  information—such as an Employer Identification Number (EIN)—in an  attempt to claim a tax refund.\nIRS has recognized business IDT as a growing threat. IRS has reported  that identity thieves show a sophisticated knowledge of the tax code and  filing practices as they attempt to obtain valuable data that enable them to  file fraudulent returns with potentially large refunds. In April 2019, IRS  reported a 10 percent increase in the number of businesses notifying IRS  that they have been victims of business IDT (2,233 notifications in 2017 to  2,450 in 2018). In addition to costing the government money, business  IDT can hurt a business’s reputation and credit and make a business  more susceptible to other types of financial fraud.\nIRS has noted that both businesses and individuals can suffer significant  financial, social, and emotional hardship as victims of identity theft (IDT)  refund fraud. As we have reported previously, the risk of IDT refund fraud  has increased as personally identifiable information (PII) has become  more readily available through cyberattacks and data breaches.  Businesses are further at risk of IDT refund fraud because their  information is often easy to obtain, as they may post key information  online, such as the names of corporate officers, address, and number of  employees. Additional business information can also be obtained through  online commercial databases. Further, federal regulations require some  types of businesses to file public reports that include data which could be  useful to a fraudster, such as data from annual financial statements. The  availability of both PII and business information poses a threat to the tax  system, making it more difficult for IRS to distinguish legitimate taxpayers  from fraudsters.\nWithin this context, you asked us to examine IRS’s efforts to detect,  prevent, and resolve business IDT. This report (1) describes IRS’s efforts  to detect business IDT, (2) evaluates the extent to which IRS’s efforts to  prevent business IDT are consistent with selected fraud risk management  leading practices, and (3) assesses IRS’s efforts to resolve business IDT  cases.\nTo address all of our objectives, we reviewed our prior reports on  individual IDT refund fraud and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration’s (TIGTA) prior reports on business IDT. We also  interviewed IRS officials from business units responsible for detecting,  preventing, and resolving business IDT cases, specifically from Return  Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS), Accounts Management (AM),  and Criminal Investigation (CI). In December 2018, we visited IRS’s  campus in Ogden, Utah, to interview officials responsible for IRS’s  business IDT efforts and to observe how RICS and AM staff process and  research business IDT cases using IRS information technology systems  and tools.\nTo describe IRS’s current efforts to detect business IDT refund fraud, we  reviewed documentation describing the business IDT fraud filters IRS  implemented from 2017 through 2019. We also analyzed data from IRS’s  Dependent Database (DDb) on business IDT fraud filter results, and data  from the Business Master File Identity Check (BMFIC) case management  system for applicable returns IRS received from mid-January 2017  through mid-August 2019. This was the most recent, complete, and  available set of data at the time of our review. We tested key data  elements, including computerized checks for missing, out-of-range, or  logically inaccurate data, and interviewed officials knowledgeable about  the data to discuss any limitations.\nWe determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to describe the  volume of incoming returns stopped by business IDT fraud filters,  associated refunds, and the outcome of business IDT cases. We also  reviewed documentation and interviewed officials to understand IRS’s  efforts to collaborate with external partners to detect and prevent  business IDT.\nTo evaluate the extent to which IRS’s efforts to prevent business IDT are  consistent with selected fraud risk management leading practices, we  reviewed the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDAA)  and A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud  Risk Framework). We generally focused our review on the first two  components of the Fraud Risk Framework: (1) commit to combating fraud  by creating an organizational culture and structure conducive to fraud risk  management, and (2) plan regular fraud risk assessments and assess  risks to determine a fraud risk profile. In doing so, we reviewed agency  strategic planning documents, organizational charts, and interviewed IRS  officials to understand each business unit’s respective role in detecting,  preventing, and resolving business IDT.\nWe reviewed documentation on IRS’s efforts to identify and assess  business IDT fraud risks, relevant Internal Revenue Manual (IRM)  sections, and prior GAO, TIGTA, and National Taxpayer Advocate reports  related to three inherent fraud risks to business IDT. Additionally, we  obtained information from interviews with RICS, AM, CI, RAAS, and IRS’s  Office of the Chief Risk Officer to understand IRS’s efforts to combat  business IDT through fraud risk management. We also reviewed  documents and information on IRS’s efforts to collect quality data on  incoming business and employment returns. We compared these efforts  to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to  using quality information and leading practices identified in the Fraud Risk  Framework.\nTo assess IRS’s current efforts to resolve business IDT cases, we  reviewed IRS procedures for managing, researching, and resolving  business IDT cases. We analyzed data from BMFIC and IRS’s  Correspondence Imaging System (CIS) to determine how long RICS and  AM took to resolve business IDT cases. We assessed the reliability of  CIS data by testing key data elements and interviewing knowledgeable  IRS officials. Based on this effort and our assessment of BMFIC data  reliability described above, we determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable to determine how long it took RICS and AM to resolve  business IDT cases.\nWe also interviewed IRS officials to determine potential reasons for  delays in resolving cases. Finally, we compared RICS and AM’s efforts to  resolve business IDT cases against Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) guidance on program management and providing customer  service. See appendix I for details on our scope and methodology.\nWe conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to January 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\nOur objectives were to (1) describe the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS)  efforts to detect business identity theft refund fraud (business IDT), (2)  evaluate the extent to which IRS’s efforts to prevent business IDT are  consistent with selected fraud risk management leading practices, and (3)  assess IRS’s efforts to resolve business IDT cases. In this report,  business IDT refers to the fraudulent use of both business and  employment tax forms. Both of these types of forms require an Employer  Identification Number (EIN) when filing with IRS, and a fraudster can file  these forms to obtain a refund.\nTo address all of our objectives, we reviewed our prior reports on  individual identity theft refund fraud and the Treasury Inspector General  for Tax Administration’s (TIGTA) prior reports on business IDT. We also  interviewed IRS officials from business units responsible for detecting,  preventing, and resolving business IDT cases, specifically from Return  Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS), Accounts Management (AM),  and Criminal Investigation (CI). In December 2018, we visited IRS’s  campus in Ogden, Utah, to interview officials responsible for IRS’s  business IDT efforts and to observe how RICS and AM staff process and  research business IDT cases using IRS information technology systems  and tools.\nTo describe IRS’s current processes to detect business IDT refund fraud,  we reviewed documentation describing the business IDT fraud filters IRS  implemented from 2017 through 2019, including the logic for each filter  and the forms to which they apply. In addition, we analyzed data from  IRS’s Dependent Database (DDb) on business IDT fraud filter results for  applicable incoming business and employment tax returns IRS received  from mid-January 2017 through mid-August 2019. This was the most  recent, complete, and available set of data at the time of our review. This  analysis showed the volume of returns selected by IRS’s business IDT  fraud filters by form, tax processing year, and associated refund amount.\nWe also analyzed data from IRS’s Business Master File Identity Check  (BMFIC) system—RICS’s case management system for business IDT  returns flagged by DDb—for cases opened from mid-January 2017  through mid-August 2019. These were the most complete set of data  available at the time of our review. Our analysis of BMFIC data showed  the number of returns that RICS researched as potential business IDT,  the outcome of the case, and associated refund amounts. For the  purpose of analysis and reporting, we grouped business IDT case  outcomes into three categories: confirmed business IDT, not business  IDT, and open/unresolved.\nWe assessed the reliability of data from these systems by: (1) testing key  data elements, including checks for missing, out-of-range, or logically  inaccurate data; (2) reviewing documents for information about the data  and IRS’s systems; and (3) interviewing officials knowledgeable about the  data to discuss any limitations. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable to describe the volume of incoming returns stopped by  business IDT fraud filters, associated refunds, and the outcome of  business IDT cases.\nTo understand IRS’s efforts to collaborate with external partners to detect  and prevent business IDT, we interviewed IRS and state officials from the  Security Summit’s Business IDT sub-workgroup and reviewed IRS’s 2018  report which analyzed business-related data elements from incoming tax  returns. We also interviewed IRS officials about a pilot program with the  Alabama Department of Labor to help detect and deactivate potentially  suspicious EINs established in that state. For context, we obtained  information from January to December 2018 from IRS on the  performance of this pilot, including the number of EINs identified as  fraudulent.\nTo evaluate the extent to which IRS’s efforts to prevent business IDT are  consistent with selected fraud risk management leading practices, we  reviewed the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act (FRDAA) of 2015  and leading practices outlined in A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks  in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). We generally focused our  review on the first two components of the Fraud Risk Framework: (1)  commit to combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and  structure conducive to fraud risk management, and (2) plan regular fraud  risk assessments and assess risks to determine a fraud risk profile. We  reviewed agency documents and information obtained from interviews, as  described below, and compared them against leading practices identified  in the Fraud Risk Framework related to these two components.\nWe reviewed IRS’s most recent strategic planning documents related  to reducing fraud, IRS organizational charts, and relevant Internal  Revenue Manual (IRM) sections on business IDT operations and  procedures. We interviewed officials from RICS, AM, CI, and the  Office of Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics (RAAS) to  understand each business unit’s respective role in detecting,  preventing, and resolving business IDT cases and the extent to which  business units work together on day-to-day and longer-term efforts. In  addition, we reviewed IRS reports on business IDT case workload.  We also reviewed meeting notes from IRS’s IDT Executive Steering  Committee (July and October 2017, and January and October 2018)  to understand the extent to which IRS’s executive-level groups are, for  example, involved in helping guide business IDT efforts or made  aware of business IDT challenges.\nWe interviewed officials from RICS, AM, CI, and RAAS and reviewed  documentation on IRS’s efforts to identify and assess business IDT  fraud risks. These included reviewing RAAS’s analyses on business  IDT fraud filter performance, descriptions of potential new fraud filters  that IRS may implement in the future, and the Wage and Investment  Division’s risk register. We also interviewed officials from IRS’s Office  of the Chief Risk Officer to understand IRS’s efforts to compile and  report on enterprise-wide fraud risks and agency efforts to develop an  antifraud culture.\nFurther, we reviewed documentation related to three inherent fraud  risks to business IDT that we identified in the course of our work:  correspondence-based authentication, EIN vulnerabilities, and high  false-detection rates for IDT fraud filters. This included reviewing  prior GAO, TIGTA, and National Taxpayer Advocate reports and the  status of open recommendations, and relevant IRM sections. We  reviewed the methodologies of these reports and found them  reasonable for the purpose of describing the inherent risks related to  business IDT.\nIn addition, we identified a false detection rate for business IDT fraud  filters based on BMFIC cases opened from mid-January 2017 through  December 2018. To do so, we compared the number of cases IRS  determined were not business IDT, relative to the total number of  cases. We did not include BMFIC cases from 2019 because at the  time of our analysis, about 27 percent of those cases were  unresolved.\nWe also assessed the extent to which IRS is positioned to estimate  the size and scope of business IDT. To do so, we reviewed  documents and information on IRS’s efforts to collect quality data on  incoming business and employment returns. We compared these  efforts to leading practices associated with the first two components of  the Fraud Risk Framework and Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government related to using quality information.  Specifically, we determined what proportion of incoming business and  employment tax forms filed in 2018 would have been screened by  business IDT fraud filters, by tax form type. We also reviewed a  preliminary plan and interviewed RAAS and RICS officials on their  efforts to develop a business IDT taxonomy.\nTo assess IRS’s efforts to resolve business IDT cases, we reviewed IRS  procedures for managing, researching, and resolving pre-refund and  post-refund business IDT cases. We interviewed officials from RICS and  AM to understand the rationale behind their respective current case  resolution time frames, and potential reasons for case resolution delays.  We compared RICS and AM’s efforts to resolve business IDT cases  against Office of Management and Budget guidance on program  management and providing customer service. To determine RICS’s  performance in resolving business IDT cases identified during the pre- refund phase, we analyzed 181,032 cases from BMFIC, described above.\nSpecifically, we calculated the duration between when RICS opened the  case in BMFIC to when the case was closed. In addition, we determined  how many cases in RICS’s inventory were open at the time of our  analysis in August 2019. For these open cases, we manually added the  date we received the data as the date the case was closed. This was an  indicator of the minimum amount of time RICS could have taken to close  these cases.\nFor this analysis, we did not include cases opened and closed in 2019  because we wanted to ensure there was sufficient time for RICS to  research and close a case. We determined that cases opened by the end  of December 2018 gave both RICS and AM (discussed below) enough  time to resolve a case. In addition, we identified an anomaly in RICS’s  2019 cases. IRS officials stated that a new fraud filter inaccurately  flagged incoming returns on one form, and IRS released these returns.  Our analysis of RICS’s data showed that these returns accounted for  about 65 percent of closed cases in 2019, and that they were resolved in  an unusually short time frame (fewer than 45 days) thus skewing the  overall data. We also did not include 1,679 cases that were opened and  closed in zero or fewer days.\nTo determine AM’s performance in resolving business IDT cases  identified during the post-refund phase, we analyzed 1,997 relevant  business IDT cases from IRS’s Correspondence Imaging System (CIS)  that AM opened from July 2016 through December 2018. As discussed  earlier, we did not include cases opened and closed in 2019 to allow AM  enough time to research and resolve a case. We calculated the duration  between when AM opened the case in CIS to when the case was closed.  We also determined how many cases in AM’s inventory were open at the  time of our analysis. For these open cases, we manually added the date  we received the data as the date the case was closed. This was an  indicator of the minimum amount of time AM could have taken to close  these cases. We assessed the reliability of the CIS data by reviewing  relevant documents, testing key data elements, and interviewing  knowledgeable IRS officials. We determined that the data from CIS was  sufficiently reliable to determine how long it took AM to resolve post- refund business IDT cases during this time period.\nWe conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to January 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix II: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service\nAppendix III: GAO Contact and Acknowledgments\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

", "response": "\n\nThis report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to combat business identity theft refund fraud (business IDT). The GAO found that business IDT is a growing threat, with the IRS receiving more than 2,450 reports of businesses being victims in 2018. This fraud can harm businesses financially, damage their reputation, and make them more vulnerable to other types of fraud.\n\nThe GAO reviewed IRS processes for detecting, preventing, and resolving business IDT cases. They found that the IRS uses fraud filters to identify potential cases and has a dedicated unit, Return Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS), to research flagged returns.\n\nHowever, the GAO identified some areas for improvement. The IRS's fraud filters had a high false-detection rate, meaning many legitimate returns were incorrectly flagged. The GAO also found that the IRS could improve its collaboration with external partners to detect and prevent business IDT.\n\nFurthermore, the GAO recommended that the IRS strengthen its efforts to estimate the size and scope of business IDT, enhance its data collection and analysis capabilities, and improve its case resolution process.\n\nSpecifically, the GAO's analysis of business IDT cases showed that RICS took an average of 141 days to close pre-refund cases, while the Accounts Management unit took an average of 267 days to close post-refund cases. The GAO suggested that these timeframes could be shortened by streamlining procedures, improving communication between units, and allocating more resources.\n\nOverall, the GAO concluded that while the IRS has taken steps to address business IDT, there is room for improvement in its detection, prevention, and resolution efforts. The GAO's recommendations aim to help the IRS become more effective in combating this growing threat to businesses and the tax system.\n"}

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nIt's shaping up to be a pretty ugly day for Bitcoin. \n \n After soaring past $250 earlier, it's tumbled all the way down to current levels around $150. \n \n Bitcoin is now 44 percent off its intraday high of $266. \n \n At its low of the day ($105), it had lost 61 percent of its value from the peak. \n \n The chart below shows Bitcoin prices from April 9 through today. \n \n bitcoin.clarkmoody.com \n \n The virtual currency briefly staged a sizeable comeback this afternoon before getting slammed again. \n \n The biggest question everyone has had about Bitcoin in recent weeks - aside from how it works - is whether or not it's in a bubble. \n \n After all, the virtual currency has seen a remarkable rise since January, when it was trading below $15. \n \n Already this afternoon, since the plunge began, we've seen some interesting defenses of the virtual currency popping up on the Internet. \n \n A Reddit user posted a graphic showing the Spartans' shields from the movie 300 redesigned as Bitcoins with the word HOLD! across the top. \n \n Another Reddit user sought to use technical analysis to explain away today's move. \n \n However, episodes like today's highlight the biggest problem with Bitcoin: confidence. ||||| Courtesy of Casascius/Wikimedia Commons \n \n Update, 3:13 p.m.: The bitcoin market is extremely volatile today, with the price ranging from a low of $120 to a high of $266. You can see the latest prices at the top of the page here. \n \n Let me begin this column with a lengthy disclosure. One morning last week, I stopped at my bank, filled out a withdrawal slip for $1,027.51, and walked away with an envelope full of cash. The odd amount was deliberate; I had been instructed by LocalTill to be exact in everything I did. What’s LocalTill? Don’t bother Googling it—its shady-looking website offers only murky details, explaining that the firm is a way for “merchants to accept secure transactions when selling goods online.” It’s something like PayPal, except LocalTill isn’t tied to your bank account or credit card, and instead deals only in cash. This makes its transactions less traceable, less regulated, and, as I would soon experience, more final. \n \n Next, per LocalTill’s instructions, I drove to a local Bank of America branch and asked for an out-of-state wire transfer slip. I scrawled out LocalTill’s New York bank account number and handed my wad of cash to the teller. This was a dizzying moment: I’ve been on the Internet forever and have been well-schooled in frauds that begin with the instruction, “First, wire your money to an out-of-state account …” Yet here I was doing exactly that. If LocalTill was a scam, I’d have no recourse. So why was I willing to take such a risk? \n \n Bitcoin, of course. Bitcoin is a “digital currency” invented in 2009 by a cryptographic expert who went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, but whose true identity remains unknown. It exists only in computers, minted at a regular rate by a network of machines around the world, and its value isn’t regulated by any government. The currency, like its creator, clings to the shadows. Bitcoins are like cash in that they aren’t tied to your identity, and transactions made with bitcoins are irreversible and untraceable. But they’re like credit cards in that they aren’t physical. In the past, if I wanted to pay you for certain unmentionable services rendered, I’d have to get a fancy briefcase, fill it with bills, then take a long, dangerous trip with my stash. Bitcoin allows me to transfer money to you online, instantly, for free. As a result, it’s perfect for the black market—a couple of years ago, it became a media sensation when Gawker reported on its use as the central currency on Silk Road, a site that sold virtually any drug in the world. Lately bitcoin has also been hailed as an emerging global safe haven, a place for nervous Europeans and panicky gold-bug types to store their wealth away from the prying reach of financial regulators. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n I’m not very panicky about the world’s currencies, nor am I looking to buy drugs online. Indeed, I don’t care at all for bitcoin as a currency. Instead, I wanted to buy bitcoins as pure, shameless speculation. I wanted a chance to ride a rocket ship. Partly due to its growing legitimacy as a currency but mainly because of speculators like me, the value of bitcoin is entering a bubble phase—its exchange rate with real-world currencies is hiking up at an incredible, likely unsustainable pace. In 2011, back when Gawker reported on Silk Road, you could buy a bitcoin for about $9. Since then the price has seen terrific fluctuations, but it has generally gone up. At the start of this year, each bitcoin was worth about $20. From there the chart turns into a hockey stick—by March, bitcoins hit $40, and within a month they’d doubled again. \n \n Courtesy Bitcoincharts.com. \n \n Three weeks ago, I began hearing about bitcoin everywhere I turned. One afternoon I had lunch with a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the large Silicon Valley venture firm, who told me that he’d been fielding pitch after pitch for start-ups that offered bitcoin-related services. After lunch, I got an email from David Barrett, the CEO of the fantastic expense-reporting start-up Expensify. Barrett wanted to let me know that his firm would soon let people submit expenses and get paid by their employers in bitcoins. He explained that the feature wasn’t a gimmick. Bitcoin would be helpful for people who regularly submitted expenses internationally; other services—like PayPal—charge hefty fees for moving money overseas, but with bitcoin people could send money for free. \n \n I made a mental note to start looking into a story about bitcoin’s apparent rise to legitimacy. But before I could get started, bitcoin took over the media. Henry Blodget was calling bitcoin \"the perfect asset bubble.\" Felix Salmon published a lengthy treatise on why the bubble was sure to burst. The New Yorker spoke to some of bitcoins' leading boosters about the future of the currency. Meanwhile the price just kept going up: Early last week the value of bitcoins soared past $100 each. This week, it went past $200. If you want a bitcoin today, it will cost you about $235, and if you wait till tomorrow, it will be more. \n \n Hence, my disclosure. No one is quite sure why the price of bitcoins has spiked so quickly, but one of the leading theories is that it’s been hit by what Quartz’s Zach Seward calls a “demand crisis.” The world’s supply of bitcoins is essentially fixed, but because people in the media keep talking about it, demand keeps rising. This leads to higher prices—and as prices go up, people who currently hold bitcoins develop greater and greater expectations for the currency. This causes bitcoin holders to hoard their stash, which further reduces supply, which in turn boosts the price and sparks yet more media attention—and the cycle continues until the bubble pops. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Thus, by writing about bitcoin, I’m serving, in some small way, to raise its price. And as of last week, that benefits me directly. Thankfully, my wire transfer to LocalTill went through; after taking its $21.51 processing fee, the firm transferred my $1,000 to Bitfloor, one of the many online bitcoin exchanges where people trade bitcoins for cash. I immediately put in a purchase order, and within seconds the deal was done. I was the proud owner of 7.23883 bitcoins, which I’d purchased for about $138 each. If I sold my coins now, my original $1,000 investment would be worth $1,700—not a bad return in less than a week’s time. \n \n But I’m not selling just yet. I agree with Blodget and Salmon that the bitcoin market is a bubble; at some point, as in all bubbles, prices will stop rising and they’ll likely plummet, and a lot of people will lose a lot of real and imagined money. But that’s pretty much all anyone can say about the market with any certainty. When the bubble will burst, at what price and for what reason, is completely unpredictable. And until then, while prices are going up, you could make a lot of real money from this digital funny money. \n \n My own guess is that the bubble’s popping isn’t imminent, and I think that when prices do fall, they’ll land somewhere higher than the $138 I paid for my bitcoins. I’m certain that I’ll be able to double my investment, and I might even hold out to triple it. (After that I’ll get shakier about keeping bitcoins.) Why do I think prices will get that high? Because at the moment, it’s a logistical nightmare to turn dollars into coins. You’ve got to take several leaps of faith, trusting sites that look like they were put together by teenagers. I initially tried to buy coins using MtGox, the largest trader, but the cash-processing service it uses refused to accept deposits greater than $500. What’s more, last week, shortly after bitcoins hit $142, MtGox was hit by a denial-of-service attack that took it offline for several hours. The site I used, Bitfloor, is hardly any safer. Last fall it was hit by an epic hack that resulted in the theft of 24,000 coins, at the time worth $250,000—and worth, amazingly, $5.6 million today.* (Bitfloor now claims to store most of its customers’ coins in machines that aren’t connected to the Internet, and it uses two-factor authentication to protect its users’ accounts.) \n \n At the moment, the shadiness of the bitcoin market dissuades mainstream investors. And—as we saw in the housing and dot-com bubbles—it’s when the masses get involved that bubbles really take off. Over the next few months, I expect that we’ll see better, more secure services for transferring dollars into bitcoin exchange systems. You’ll be able to send money to sites like MtGox instantly from your bank account. At that point—when ordinary people can order up bitcoins as easily as they bought shares of Pets.com back in 1999—the real money will pour into the bitcoin economy, and that’s when prices will begin to get really crazy. \n \n That’s just a theory. It could be a stupid one; bitcoin could collapse tomorrow. And remember, I’ve got a conflict of interest here—if this piece gets you interested in bitcoin, I get richer. Still, though, one week into my bitcoin trade, I’m very, very pleased with myself. ||||| A financial network is a technological platform that people build businesses on top of. And the traditional banking and credit card networks are closed platforms. If you want to build an e-commerce site, a payment network like Paypal, or any other service that deals in dollars, you need to convince incumbent financial institutions to do business with you. Getting such a partnership is difficult and involves a lot of red tape. \n \n There's a good reason for the high barrier to entry: electronic transactions in the conventional banking system are generally reversible. If someone makes a fraudulent charge to your credit card, you can dispute the transaction and in most cases the bank or the merchant, not the customer, will cover the cost. That's convenient for consumers, but it requires the financial system to be a fairly close-knit web of trust. Allowing a new member into the club creates risks for everyone else. So the incumbents are understandably reluctant to deal with anyone who isn't well-known and well-capitalized. \n \n Bitcoin is different. Because transactions are authenticated cryptographically and cannot be reversed, there's no need to restrict access to the network. There's no risk to accepting payments from complete strangers. That means people don't need anyone's permission or trust to go into business as a Bitcoin-based merchant or financial intermediary. Accepting Bitcoins also allows merchants to avoid much of the administrative overhead, like dealing with chargebacks, that come with a conventional merchant account. \n \n Of course, what looks like a plus for merchants can look more like a minus for consumers. Consumers generally like the conventional banking system's strong consumer protections. We like the fact that we're not on the hook for fraudulent banking transactions, and that the FDIC will make us whole if the bank holding our money goes bottom-up. \n \n And Bitcoin looks inferior to the conventional banking system in other ways too. Visa and Mastercard are accepted at millions of locations around the world. Only a handful of merchants accept Bitcoins. Conventional banks have elaborate websites with features like direct deposite of paychecks and automatic bill-paying. Dealing with Bitcoin is too intimidating for all but a tiny minority of tech-savvy enthusiasts. \n \n If you've read Clay Christensen's The Innovator's Dilemma, the last three paragraphs should ring a bell. The book's argument helps to explain why a seemingly inferior payment network like Bitcoin has generated so much excitement. \n \n The term Christensen coined, \"disruptive innovation,\" has become so overused as to become a cliche. But he gave it a fairly precise meaning with a lot of explanatory power. A disruptive technology is one that's simpler and cheaper than what's already on the market. Often, disruptive technologies are also inferior to what's already on the market. They tend to be dismissed as impractical toys by industry incumbents. \n \n The PC is a classic example of a disruptive innovation. The first PCs were much less capable than mini-computers and mainframes that were already on the market at the time. They had less powerful hardware and software and little if any customer support. And if you'd asked a hobbyist circa 1978 what PCs were good for, he probably wouldn't have had a good answer. \n \n But the low cost and simplicity of PCs meant that a lot more people could play around with them. One of those tinkerers, Dan Bricklin, invented the spreadsheet, the PC's first \"killer app.\" And over time, people gradually figured out how to use these cheap, simple computers to perform functions that had previously required a computer that cost ten times as much. Most \"servers\" today are just souped-up PCs, and they're orders of magnitude cheaper than computers that existed before 1975. \n \n The Bitcoin economy today looks a lot like the PC market circa 1978. Most people today look at Bitcoin and see an impractical curiosity. They're happy with the banking services they've already got and can't imagine why anyone would want to use an alternative currency that's much less widely accepted and offers many fewer consumer protections. \n \n But a minority of nerds are playing around with it. Interesting applications keep popping up. There are Bitcoin-based banks, casinos, drug emporia, derivatives markets, retailers, and much more. Many of the new applications seem weird or marginal, and most of them probably won't amount to anything. But one of them might prove to be Bitcoin's Visicalc. \n \n When people dismiss Bitcoins because they can't think of how they'd use it, they're missing the fact that Bitcoin is a platform, not a product in its own right. When ordinary users started buying computers, it wasn't because they thought it would be cool to own a computer. They did it because they wanted to do spreadsheets or word processing or email. Similarly, ordinary users aren't going to start using Bitcoins just because it's a cool technology. If normal users start using Bitcoin, it will be because they're interested in gambling, or cheap international money transfers, or some other applications that hasn't been invented yet. And Bitcoin's intermediary-free architecture means that many more people can try their hand at building the platform's killer app. \n \n Disclosure: I own some bitcoins. ||||| The price of the electronic currency Bitcoin continues to soar. \n \n Six weeks ago, Bitcoin was trading at $35. Since then, the price has continued to surge to new highs. Just this morning, Bitcoin blasted through $250. \n \n As is always the case with such price moves, observers have been dismissing Bitcoin as a \"bubble\" since long before prices even hit $35. \n \n And the observers may well be right. \n \n Bitcoin may be a bubble. \n \n Someday, Bitcoin prices may come crashing down, causing the suckers who own them then to lose their shirts. \n \n But, in the meantime, those who are speculating in Bitcoin are just laughing at all the people who are dismissing Bitcoin as a bubble. These speculators have made 7X their money in six weeks, which is a return that more than justifies the risk they took of potentially losing everything. (As long as the chance of each outcome is roughly the same, downside of 100% and upside of 600% is a great bet.) \n \n Like the assets at the center of most powerful asset bubbles, Bitcoin has sound theoretical underpinnings. The world can benefit from a convenient global electronic currency that is not subject to the whims and political incentives of governments trying to get themselves reelected. \n \n Importantly, Bitcoin also has a small and (at least theoretically) finite supply. So the more demand for Bitcoins increases, the more the price of Bitcoins should rise. \n \n Of course, as in any bubble, the more Bitcoin prices rise, the more demand there will be for Bitcoins. Bitcoin buyers may tell themselves stories about how they are buying a \"store of value\" in an inflationary world, how Bitcoin is a \"good investment,\" and so forth, but these stories will seem much less compelling if Bitcoin prices suddenly drop, say, 75%. \n \n If Bitcoin prices crash, all the folks who now think Bitcoin is a \"good investment\" will suddenly start crying bloody murder that they were tricked into buying something with no inherent value. And they will want to jettison their Bitcoins at any price someone will pay for them. \n \n (This is just the way bubble psychology works. Sorry about that.) \n \n In the meantime, though, Bitcoin prices could rise another 2X. Or 10X. Or 100X. \n \n Why? \n \n Because there's really just no way to figure out what a \"fair price\" for Bitcoin is. There's is theoretically a finite supply of it. And there is theoretically nearly unlimited demand for it. So there's no theoretical reason why Bitcoins can't eventually trade for $500, or $2,500, or $25,000. Or even $250,000. \n \n And that means that brass-balled speculators will likely continue to plow into Bitcoin, as long as think it will continue to appeal to new speculators who haven't yet entered the game. \n \n But! \n \n Because Bitcoins have no inherent value (only the value that they can be exchanged for, which is determined in large part by speculators), Bitcoin prices could crash permanently at any time. \n \n So it's worth thinking about what might cause Bitcoin prices to come crashing down. \n \n Here are some things: \n \n A sating of demand. At some point, everyone who could ever learn about or use Bitcoin will know about it, and many of them will own it. Given the lack of awareness about Bitcoin among the general population, as well as the complexity and \"friction\" involved in owning Bitcoin, we are a long way from this point. \n \n At some point, everyone who could ever learn about or use Bitcoin will know about it, and many of them will own it. Given the lack of awareness about Bitcoin among the general population, as well as the complexity and \"friction\" involved in owning Bitcoin, we are a long way from this point. A drop in the price of Bitcoin (for whatever reason). Another thing that could cause demand for Bitcoin to drop is a Bitcoin price crash. If Bitcoin prices crash, many of those who already own them will not want to own them anymore--and they'll jettison them. This will cause a further price crash, which will further reduce demand.

If Bitcoin gains general acceptance, governments may begin to frown on it. After all, general acceptance of Bitcoin would usurp the governments' sole authority to create legal money. Governments don't like having their authority usurped. So they may begin to enact laws that prohibit the use of Bitcoin. \n \n If Bitcoin gains general acceptance, governments may begin to frown on it.

This is a very real risk, one that Bitcoin enthusiasts don't spend enough time worrying about. Again, there is nothing special about Bitcoin. Although awareness of it is growing, it's still complicated and hard to use. And monetary philosophers are already pointing out that the \"finite supply\" of Bitcoins may, in fact, be too small, limiting their usefulness. So if Bitcoin can gain traction, then so can any other electronic currency. And if another electronic currency begins to displace Bitcoin, the \"finite supply\" argument will go out the window. There might soon be a nearly unlimited amount of a better Bitcoin. \n \n All of these factors--and many others--could cause Bitcoin prices to crash. \n \n Bitcoin speculators would do well to remember that. \n \n SEE ALSO: I'm Raising My Bitcoin Price Target To $400 \n \n Get the latest Bitcoin price here. \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Summarize the following news to a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nA government shutdown has become increasingly likely as conservatives ramp up pressure on House Republicans to reject a Senate bill restoring funding for ObamaCare. \n \n \n \n Conservative activists say Speaker John Boehner’s (R-Ohio) credibility is on the line, and warn he will not serve another term as House GOP leader if he agrees to fund the Affordable Care Act along with the rest of government. \n \n \n \n \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Senate Democrats, however, say Boehner will be responsible for shutting down the government if he makes any changes to the stopgap bill that the Senate passed on Friday.\"I want everyone to listen and to hear: The United States Senate has acted,\" Reid said on the Senate floor. \"This is the only legislation that can avert a government shutdown, and that time is ticking as we speak.\"Reid adjourned the Senate until 2 pm Monday, leaving the House to work out the government funding stalemate on its own. Reid’s staff said there are not any talks with Boehner on finding a compromise before the Oct. 1 deadline.Brent Bozell, the chairman of ForAmerica and a prominent conservative activist, said Boehner would face calls to step down if he accepts a stopgap spending measure that does not defund or delay ObamaCare.“He’s going to be threatened. If he chooses to side with Barack Obama and with the Democrats in order to fund ObamaCare, then he owns ObamaCare and he can’t get out of that.“He’ll be as responsible for ObamaCare as Harry Reid,” he said.Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, said conservative groups around the country on Friday began focusing a national grassroots lobbying campaign on House Republicans.She said Tea Party Patriots directed 10,000 calls a day to Senate offices while the upper chamber debated a resolution linking the stopgap with a measure defunding ObamaCare.Martin said there would be growing calls from conservatives around the country for Boehner to resign if he allows the Senate-passed stopgap to receive a vote on the House floor.“I think if he does that we’ll probably see people across this country in the grassroots calling for a new Speaker,” she said.The Senate stopgap bill does not include language defunding ObamaCare or prioritizing debt payments in the event that Congress fails to raise the debt limit. Both elements were in the original House bill.Threats from conservative activists are nothing new for Boehner. In March, Bozell blasted Boehner and other House GOP leaders for failing to deliver on the promises of the 2010 midterm election.Boehner’s spokesman on Friday said the House would not approve a government funding bill that fails to address the Affordable Care Act.“The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is ObamaCare,” said Brendan Buck.House Republicans will meet at around noon on Saturday in the Capitol to plot their legislative strategy.“We are reviewing our options and will discuss them with members tomorrow,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner.Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) announced Friday afternoon that he would offer an amendment to the stopgap bill delaying ObamaCare until 2015. The proposal has 61 supporters.The mounting pressure from Tea Party groups and the tough rhetoric from House Republicans has alarmed senators who say a government shutdown appears more likely.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said the situation is more unpredictable now than in 2011, when Congress teetered on the brink of a government shutdown and then a possible national default.“Reading the tea leaves is more difficult. I think it is going to be difficult on the [funding bill] and it may be even more difficult on the debt ceiling,” Corker said. “I think it’s going to be tough for them.”Even if congressional leaders avoid a shutdown, they will face another showdown in mid-October over the debt limit. The administration says the nation’s borrowing authority must be increased by Oct. 17.President Obama on Friday said negotiating with Republicans on the government funding bill would only give them incentive to use the debt-ceiling and any future expiration of government funding as bargaining chips.“The bill that's designed to avert a government shutdown basically just funds the government for another couple months, so we could be doing this all over again,” he said. “I'm sure the American people are thrilled about that. And that's why we've got to break this cycle.”Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, said a shutdown is possible despite Senate passage of the stopgap.“Some of the Democrats think they can provoke a shutdown and they can blame the Republicans for it,” he said.House Republican leaders might focus now on trying to buy time, possibly by passing a weeklong stopgap.A senior Senate GOP aide discounted that possibility, however.“Passing a weeklong CR isn’t going to get you anywhere. Anything that can’t pass now won’t pass in a week or two weeks,” said the aide.A Senate Democratic aide said Tea Party Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) would not allow Reid to waive procedural rules to approve a one-week stopgap quickly enough to avert a shutdown.Lee declined to say whether he would grant consent in such a scenario.“I’d have to think that through under the totality of the circumstances if we had something like that,” he said.Cruz urged House Republicans to stand firm against any government funding bill that allows the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to move ahead. The law’s open-enrollment period begins Oct. 1.“I hope and believe that when the House takes this up again House Republicans will continue to stand together on the side of the American people,” he said.He said if the House returns the stopgap with new language defunding or delaying ObamaCare, “it will be an opportunity for every Senate Republican to come home, to stand for the principles we all share.”He spoke to reporters shortly after 25 Senate Republicans voted to let the Senate version of the bill reach a final vote. \n \n \n \n ||||| House and Senate leadership aides in both parties are increasingly convinced the federal government will close for the first time in more than 17 years on Tuesday morning. \n \n There is still time to avoid such a climactic stalemate, the aides acknowledged. But unless there is a dramatic change in momentum, the likelihood that a partisan showdown over government funding and the future of Obamacare could lead to a shutdown has increased dramatically. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Obama to Congress: 'Pay our bills on time' Turn the Table: Threat of a government shutdown \n \n With a special closed-door meeting meeting of House Republicans set for noon Saturday, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his top lieutenants have not yet formulated their next play in their quest to keep the government open. It’s not even clear that the House will vote on Saturday. \n \n (PHOTOS: How well do you know the news: Shutdown edition) \n \n There have been repeated contacts between GOP and Democratic leaders and senior aides in recent days but no negotiations of any sort – or sign those are about to start – to resolve the standoff. Both sides feel they have made their position known to the other side, and are unwilling to make any concessions at this moment. \n \n Senior House GOP sources say Republicans are likely to send the Senate an amended government-funding bill, but not a proposed one-week stop gap measure. Without that one-week funding bill - needed while Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the White House try to reach a compromise agreement - the federal government will beginning shutting down “non-essential” operations on Tuesday morning. \n \n House Republicans are considering adding several provisions to the two-month, $986 billion continuing resolution passed by the Senate on Friday, and then sending the bill back to the the upper chamber. These options include: a one-year delay of the individual mandate called for in the 2010 Affordable Care Act; an end to government’s contribution to health care for lawmakers and Hill staffers; a repeal of the medical devices tax that helps fund Obamacare; or the elimination of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a controversial Obamacare provision designed to hold down Medicare costs. \n \n (WATCH - Debt ceiling showdown: By the numbers) \n \n Reid, though, has already warned Boehner that he will block any House GOP funding bill with Obamacare-related provisions. Reid would move to table any House bill that contains those additional provisions favored by House Republicans. Reid could do that with a simple majority vote on Monday, setting up a government shutdown the following morning. \n \n ”We are going to accept nothing that relates to Obamacare. There’s a time and place for everything and this is not that time or place,” Reid said at a press conference following Friday’s vote. \n \n President Barack Obama warned Republicans to “think about who you’re hurting” by letting the government shut down and said a closure would “throw a wrench into the gears of our economy at a time when those gears have gained some traction.” \n \n Boehner, however, is under heavy pressure from his tea party and conservative House GOP colleagues to move to stop Obamacare’s implementation, whatever the political risk, including a shutdown. \n \n (VIDEO: Major players to watch in shutdown showdown on Capitol Hill) \n \n Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is privately meeting with hard-line House conservatives to try to get them to hold out against any spending bill that does not defund or delay Obamacare — set to begin on Oct. 1, the same date government funding runs out. A House GOP debt ceiling package loaded with conservative goodies, including a provision delaying Obamacare’s individual mandate for a year, couldn’t even get enough support to make it to the floor, demonstrating how little sway Boehner holds over his rank-and-file members at this point. \n \n Friday saw a new headache for the Ohio Republican - GOP lawmakers who are pushing back against others in the party who want to end the government contribution to the health insurance of lawmakers and staff. \n \n Some of Boehner’s (R-Ohio) top allies marched into his Capitol office Friday afternoon to beg the speaker not to cut off health-insurance subsidies, which are deeply unpopular with the party base. Under heavy pressure from Capitol Hill — including Boehner — the Obama administration ruled in late July that lawmakers could continue receiving the employer contribution even as they enroll in new health insurance exchanges. \n \n (PHOTOS: John Boehner’s life and career) \n \n On Friday, Boehner told the group — GOP Reps. Tom Cole (Okla.), Duncan Hunter, Jr. (Calif.), Mike Turner (Ohio), Kay Granger (Texas) and Anders Crenshaw (Fla.) — to canvass the House Republican Conference to find out what might get support, according to sources familiar with the talks. \n \n For the moment, it appears that those lawmakers may win that fight, despite repeated calls from Republicans like Rep. Mike McCaul (Texas) and Sen.David Vitter (La.) to get rid of the subsidy, similar to that other Americans get from their employers. \n \n “For the last 25 years, members of Congress have been treated like every other federal employee,” said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a staunch opponent of cutting those subsidies who spoke up against the idea in a closed party meeting. “This idea of trying to vilify us now …, that is not the right thing to do.” \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Obama to Congress: ‘Pay our bills on time’) \n \n Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), once a congressional staffer himself, said he was “a little concerned” with cutting staff health insurance subsidies. \n \n Yet it’s obvious – and a huge understatement – to say the House GOP leadership is in a difficult predicament right now. Reid and Obama have refused to yield any ground on either the CR or the even more high stakes debt ceiling fight. The Treasury Department has warned the federal government will hit its $16.7 trillion borrowing limit on Oct. 17. \n \n Obama is not interested in giving away pieces of his health care law just to fund government’s operations. And Boehner’s conservatives – who are taking their lead from Cruz – are not interested in giving up on their fight to defund Obamacare. There’s next to no trust in leadership’s strategies, and even less in Boehner himself. \n \n (VIDEO: Mitt Romney thinks there's a better way to stop Obamacare) \n \n The last few weeks have been a game of whack-a-mole for Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.): they’ve cycled through a number of strategies to both fund the government, and lift the debt limit. But each time they do, the party’s conservative wing shoots it down and demands a new plan. \n \n GOP leadership will try once again to wrangle support for something – anything – on Saturday, when they meet in a closed session in the Capitol basement. House leadership said they might not even vote on a CR Saturday; that vote could slip until Sunday, Republicans lawmakers and aides said. ||||| “The planning itself is disruptive,” an exhausted Hale told reporters. “People are worrying right now about whether their paychecks are going to be delayed, rather than focusing fully on their mission.” \n \n Shutdown planning has eaten up “probably thousands of hours in employee time better spent on supporting national security,” Hale said. \n \n The tempo was similar at just about every federal agency this week, with managers racing from planning meetings to town hall gatherings with their employees. \n \n Hundreds of thousands of employees who got word Friday that their jobs would not be essential prepared to turn in their government-issued BlackBerrys and \n \n iPhones on Tuesday morning, while colleagues who must still report to the office wondered how their agencies would carry out their missions. \n \n In the Defense Department, about 400,000 civilians will have to stay home if Congress does not pass a bill to keep the government open, Hale said. \n \n Preparing for even a partial closure is a unique challenge for the Defense Department, which has a global reach that includes about 200 schools, 250 commissaries, and 700 hospitals and clinics. The department’s mission is singular within the federal government. The Pentagon must continue to support its combat operations in Afghanistan and deployments in many corners of the world. \n \n In his Office of Public Affairs on Friday, Army Col. Steve Warren was coming to grips with the reality facing his staff. \n \n “I’ve got no essentials in here, and I’m concerned,” Warren said, as CNN reported on his flat-screen television about the latest developments on Capitol Hill. \n \n Half the press staff is active- \n \n duty military and the other half civilians, a common mix throughout the agency. The uniformed officers must come to work in a shutdown. \n \n Warren was worrying about manning hundreds of Pentagon Web sites and Twitter and Facebook, which get information to the public. “Guess who runs most of them?” he said. “Civilians who are not essential.” \n \n Some Defense Web sites are run by contractors who will probably be working, since their funding has been approved. But if the federal workers supervising them are furloughed, the contractors may not be able to work. ||||| Among the affects of a federal shutdown: delays in processing passport and visa applications, issuing gun permits, continuing U.S. bankruptcy court cases and approving mortgage applications. \n \n In this Nov. 15, 1995, file photo, a U.S. Park Service police officer stands in front of closed signs at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, during a partial shutdown of the federal government. (Photo: AP file photo) Story Highlights If budget deal is not worked out, federal government will shut down after midnight Monday \n \n Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid payments would continue during a shutdown \n \n About 41 percent of nondefense federal employees would be furloughed \n \n WASHINGTON – If Democrats and Republicans don't reach a spending deal by midnight Monday, a partial government shutdown will take effect. \n \n The 2013 fiscal year ends at midnight Monday. Many federal programs and activities will stop beginning Tuesday and won't restart until a new deal is in place. \n \n Here's a guide to understanding how Congress got to this stage and how a shutdown would affect you. \n \n Question: Will the entire government come to a standstill if a deal isn't reached? \n \n Answer: No. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other \"entitlement\" programs that are funded automatically will escape the worst effects. But government agencies that rely on yearly congressional appropriations will be hit a lot harder. That includes giant agencies such as the Pentagon and smaller ones such as the National Park Service. \n \n WHERE DO YOU FIT?: Breaking down the Affordable Care Act \n \n Federal agencies have prepared plans to continue programs they deem critical to maintaining public safety and protecting property despite the shutdown. Employees who perform those critical functions will continue to work and get paid. \n \n For instance, air traffic controllers and firefighters contracted by the National Forest Service would continue to work, but park rangers and researchers who conduct clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health would be furloughed. \n \n USA TODAY estimates that about 41 percent of nondefense federal employees will be furloughed, but the remaining 59 percent will continue working. \n \n Q: Will I still get my mail? \n \n A: Yes. The U.S. Postal Service isn't funded by taxpayers. Independently financed agencies like the Postal Service won't be affected. \n \n Q: How did Congress get in this situation? \n \n A: In a word, partisanship. Differences between Democrats and Republicans are deepening over virtually every issue, and federal spending is the biggest one of all. \n \n A temporary spending measure -- a continuing resolution, or CR -- approved by the GOP-controlled House on Sept. 20 would have kept the government running until mid-December but would have cut funding to implement the Affordable Care Act. \n \n The Democratic-majority Senate rejected that plan, designed to gut President Barack Obama's signature health care law. On Friday the Senate approved its own CR that included money for the law known as \"Obamacare.\" \n \n House leaders are meeting over the weekend to consider their next move. If the House modifies the Senate CR as Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has promised, then the Senate has to approve the amended version before it reaches the White House. \n \n It's unclear if and when those legislative steps will be fulfilled. Short answer: Things remain in limbo. \n \n Q: What will be the impact of a shutdown? \n \n A: All national parks and federal wildlife refuges would be closed for the duration of the shutdown, the Interior Department said Friday. About 9 million visitors were turned away from parks, museums and monuments run by the National Park Service in the mid-1990s, the last time the government shut down temporarily. \n \n About 40 percent of the nation's 2 million federal workers would be furloughed. Though Congress has approved restoring lost pay retroactively in the past, there's no guarantee lawmakers will do that this time. \n \n About 1.4 million active-duty military personnel must remain on the job but won't get paid until a new deal is signed into law. Active National Guard units also must continue to work. Most civilian employees of the Defense Department face furloughs. \n \n Some other possibilities: Delays in processing tens of thousands of passport and visa applications, issuing gun permits, continuing U.S. bankruptcy court cases and approving mortgage applications. \n \n Many congressional and White House staffers also may have to stay home. But members of Congress and the president are exempt from furloughs \n \n Q: Has the government been shut down in the past? \n \n A: Yes. The last one lasted 21 days from Dec. 15, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. It came soon after a five-day shutdown that lasted from Nov. 13-19, 1995. A disagreement over tax cuts between then-President Bill Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., precipitated those shutdowns. \n \n Since 1976, there have been 17 shutdowns, though before the 1980s the government continued operating at reduced levels without furloughing workers. \n \n Q: Isn't there going to be another showdown over raising the debt limit? \n \n A: That's highly likely. Republicans, particularly ultraconservative tea party members, argue the debt ceiling shouldn't be raised unless Congress makes sizable spending cuts. \n \n Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has said the government will run out of money around Oct. 17. In addition to using tax revenues, the Obama administration has to borrow more money to pay bills the nation has already racked up. But Congress has to raise the debt limit to allow increased borrowing -- and that permission won't come without another fight. \n \n If the debt ceiling isn't raised, the U.S. economy will suffer even more that under a shutdown, Obama said Friday. For instance, interest rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages loans could rise. And the nation's creditworthiness -- and global influence -- would take a beating, experts say, though critics dismiss such talk as hyperbole. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/19IaFCl \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

House Republicans are contemplating amendments to the Senate-passed stopgap bill, including delaying the implementation of Obamacare's individual mandate, ending government contributions to healthcare for lawmakers and staff, repealing the medical devices tax, and eliminating the Independent Payment Advisory Board. However, Reid warned that any House bill with these provisions will be rejected.\n\nPresident Obama urged Republicans to reconsider, emphasizing the economic harm a shutdown would cause. Boehner faces pressure from his tea party and conservative members to fight against Obamacare, even if it leads to a shutdown.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz is rallying House conservatives to oppose any funding bill that doesn't defund or delay Obamacare. Despite calls from some Republicans to cut off health insurance subsidies for lawmakers and staff, a group of Boehner's allies are pushing back against this proposal.\n\nThe House GOP leadership is scrambling to find a solution but faces strong opposition from within its own ranks. The Treasury Department has warned that the government will hit its debt ceiling on October 17, adding another layer of urgency to the situation.\n\nA shutdown would have far-reaching consequences, including furloughs for approximately 41% of non-defense federal employees, closure of national parks and museums, delays in passport and visa processing, and potential disruptions to essential services. The impact on the economy, as well as the nation's creditworthiness, could be significant if the debt ceiling is not raised.\n\n\n[Quotes]: \n* \"I want everyone to listen and to hear: The United States Senate has acted. This is the only legislation that can avert a government shutdown, and that time is ticking as we speak,\" Harry Reid\n* \"The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don't want a government shutdown and they don't want the train wreck that is Obamacare,\" Brendan Buck, spokesman for Boehner\n* \"I hope and believe that when the House takes this up again House Republicans will continue to stand together on the side of the American people,\" Ted Cruz\n* \"For the last 25 years, members of Congress have been treated like every other federal employee.

Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nProud to say I'm a battered child. Here's my story goes. \n My Grandpa was a retired military officer. Sobrang strict niya sa mga anak niya. Pero yun Papa ko once lang napalo. Lahat nga mga brothers and sister niya literal na mata lang walang latay. Pero sa lahat ng magkakapatid, yun Papa nag-adapt nun gruesome method ng \" palo \" . And to make the story much interesting, amplified version yun discipline niya. \n Almusal, tanghalian, merienda, minindal, siesta, dinner, at midnight snack buntal naransan ko lahat. And to think na disciplined na kami, munting pagkakamali lintik na buntal ang kapalit. \n 2nd ako sa magkakapatid. I have my ate and yun brother kong sumunod sakin. Lahat kami binili ng mga wristwatch na synchronized yun time sa relo niya. Di ka pwedeng magdahilan about the battery if ma-late kasi weekly checked niya if ok pa yun battery nun relo. Eto sample rules and the punishment we received.\n 1.Bawal ma-late ng uwi. Not even a minute. Sabay sabay dapat kakain and nakatoka yun mag-sasay ng grace before we eat. Minsan na late ako ng uwi ( project sa school ), sa takot kong mabuntal. Sinama ko classmates and teacher ko. Nakatayo na sa may front door si Papa, and when my teacher explained yun reason. Lumabas ng gate Papa, no uttered words. Kinulyaran ako, sabay batok ng malakas, subsob ako sa front door namin, instant spaghetti sauce yun labi ko nun tumama dun sa handle. Di na naka-imik teacher ko. Isa lang sinabi ni Papa nun. Next time teacher wag niyo ng ihahatid to ha. Ako ng susundo sa kanya. Kala ko tapos na appetizer lang pala yun. ( happened when I was in grade 2 ) \n Punishment... Pag-upo ko para kumain, ayun habang kumakain ka, binabatukan ka. Tapos you will see your mother, walang magawa para tulungan ka. She can only shed tear. Tsk awang awa ako sa sarili ko nun. To make things worst. I have offended another rule while being punished dun sa pagiging late ko.\n 1.Pag-kakain, dapat kain lang. Kailangan \" clean plate \". Since binabatukan ako dahil nga na-late ako. Ayun may nahulog na grain of rice out of my plate. When I was about to pick it up. ' Blammmm \" sa lakas nun batok sakin, subsob nanaman yun face ko sa plate ko. And he literally, send the plate flying so lahat nun laman nun sumabog na sa sahig. \n Punishment... I have to put my hands behind my back and eat every last bit of food sa sahig. Talo ko pa manok sa pagkain kasi patapos na sila kumain dapat matapos na din ako. That time pag-uminit na ulo ni Papa, di na siya kakain and di ka niya tatantanan. Di ka maktulog nun when you are sent to bed, and to console me sa nangyari, in the middle of the night, alam ni Mama na umiiyak ako. She will only go to our room just to kiss me in my forehead, and away she goes. Gusto ko siya tawagin and beg to stay with me until I fell asleep, kaso di pwede. Paga na yun labi ko and sobrang hapdi na.\n 1.Bawal maging hero. Since I consider yun araw araw na sinturon, lahat ng klase ng walis and hanger ay minor lang. I will narrate nalang yun worst whoppin'. Basta konting mistake very little lang talaga, gulpi ka na agad, kasi who would dare na gumawa ng kalokohan kung ang kapalit nun eh a week of recovery. back to rule#3. One time, thesis ng Ate ko, she was late for dinner. Like the rule stated above buntal din siya. Ayun pinunit yun report niya, the thesis itself. Almost a month work ni Ate napunit lang in an instant. Tapos habulang buntal ang naganap. Di ko na matiis, since sa lahat ng magkakapatid na-immune nako sa sakit ng katawan, sa buntal, sa gulpi, sa bugbog. Nun nakahawak ng antique chair si Papa para ibato sa Ate ko since ambilis niya tumakbo, 'alam kong tatamaan yun sis ko. Ayun, ako humarang. Sobrang sakit and ramdam na ramdam ko nun tumama sa shoulder blade ko yun upuan. Di ko magalaw right arm ko. Next thing I knew. \n Punishment... Ayun sabi sakin \" Ah, gusto mo ikaw ang masaktan ha? Bibigyan kita ng sakit \". Parang sinentensyahan nako ng deathrow nun. Dinibdiban ako, sikmura, and that time highschool nako. May batuta siya, gift from Grandpa. Yun lumang batuta, PC daw yun eh ( Philippine Constabulary ) yun ang hinataw sakin. Bawal tumakbo, bawal umiyak or umatungal. Di ko kayang maluha, hirap pigilin. Magaling pumalo si Papa. dahil di kita mga pasa ko pag suot ko school uniform. so yun pasa ko, korteng uniform. Pag nakahubad ako, parang naka-polo ako na kulay blue violet.\n 1.I forgot na yun reason kung bakit ako nabuntal. Since very minor lang talaga para maalala ko pa yun dahilan. Pero here's one of the worst punishment. \n Punishment... Siguro napagod na yun kamay kabubuntal kasi nakita niya na hindi nako nasasaktan. One time sabi niya...\" Lumayas kana, at pag lumabas ka na ng gate. Kalimutan mo ng anak kita at wag na wag ka ng babalik...Alis!!!\" quote and un-quote. So ako natuwa na, palabas nako. confident ako na maraming kukupkop samin kasi nga yun mga kapit-bahay namin awang awa samin kapag naririnig yun buntalan moments. And since sobrang sipag namin, raised and born in military way. Lahat ng gawin namin magkakapatid, we have to make sure it has to be perfect or else...kaya respeto sa nakakatanda, ingat sa mga gamit and toys 9 we barely play our toys kasi onting gasgas, or may maputol an kamay or ulo ( lego ) tsk tsk, alam na. back to the story, I was about to exit our front door. Bigla akong sinigawan, \" Pu%8#!na ka!!!, san ka pupunta ka? \" ngali-ngali kong sabihin na \" Ah, eh sa labas po...pinapalayas niyo po ako diba? \" pero siyempre..ala komiks mode na enclosed lang sa ulap yun thoughts na yun kundi sasabog nanaman nguso ko. Sabi sakin..\" Ipinanganak ka ng Mama mo ng walang damit, aalis ka sa pamamahay ko ng walang dala na kahit na ano.\" Gusto ko ng mamatay that time. ( grade 6 ) ako nun, tuli nako pero pano ako lalabas ng naka-hubo? \n The event happened when there was a heavy rainfall. Liliw yun place namin and if anyone has ever been there, mataas yun lugar na yun and the little cozy town was previously called \" little baguio \". So sobrang lamig that time, freezing cold plus the rainfall. No choice ako, so tanggal damit. Tinira ko brip ko, I was about to open the handle...biglang... \" Nakakaintindi ka ba? Pag sinabi kong hubo..HUBO!!! \" and believe me, it wasn't even a shout. It was roar, roar from hell. Yun tipong send chills to your bones. Ayun, hubo mode nako. Siyempre ayoko lumabas. That happened around 12:30 pm. Nun elem days eh, we had to go home to eat our lunch then balik ng school. So if lalabas ako, bukod sa lamig and ulan na malakas...makikita ako for sure ng mga kaklase ko. \n \" Labas!!! \" and that was out. I was out cold and I ran and ran. Nakapikit ako, I was praying na pagdilat ko, panaginip lang lahat pero hindi. Good thing 20-25meters across sa house namin ay bakanteng lote with wild grass that stood approximately 3ft. Ayun nagtago ako behind da bushes. No trees to shed me from the rainfall. My hands and feet went numb sa sobrang lamig. I closed my eyes and prayed na maging ibon nalang ako ( kaya naiiyak ako dun sa Forrest Gump, yun scene with Jinny, childhood bestfriend niya na inaabuso nun dad, she prayed to have wings ) or maging hayop nalang ako, mabura na lahat ng memory ko. Grabe mga tumatakbo sa isip ko nun that time. As I kept my eyes closed, I heard a voice. Like an angel's. When I opened my eyes, ayun sumambulat sakin. Two of my girl classmates. To make the story worst, yun isa crush ko. Nun nakita ko sila, they are both crying, naaawa siguro. Lam na kasi sa school yun pambubugbog samin so alam nila na parusa yun sakin. Yun crush ko di nagsasalita, nakatingin lang siya sakin, sa katawan ko.. hehehe...that time todo yupyop ako para di makita yun tweety bird ko ( sobrang lamig kasi eh, what do you expect ) \n The other girl her name is Kristine, she told me na \" Huy, sama kana samin. Uwi ka sa bahay. May damit don. may pagkain. Dun kana muna magpalipas ng ulan, kami na bahala kay Ma'am ( teacher ). \" Gusto ko na ayaw ko. pano ko tatayo? grade 6...tsk tsk..sabi ko umuna nalang sila and baka makita pa sila ni Papa, madamay pa sila. So on they went. Worst day and night of my life. I fell asleep, siguro sa gutom, and lamig. Ayun, sight na di ko malilimutan till this very day, I saw my Mom held a flash light and heading towards my location. She brought a blanket, nun makita ako, napahawak nalang siya sa bibig niya. Trying to hide her sobs. Ayun lang sabi niya \" Halika na Anak, tulog na Papa mo \" T'was 9pm. Taas na ng lagnat ko. I recovered after a week, ayun back to buntalan moments nanaman for such tiny mistakes. mahal na mahal ako ng Papa ko... \n Even nun college, ligaw moments na. Bugbog sarado kapag late muwi dahil sa GF. Up until now she still remember na ako yun di mapakali kapag nanliligaw ako sa kanya. I sue to tell her na..\" Una nako ha, talo ko pa kasi si Cinderella , pag nalate ako eh yun mukha ko magiging kalabasa sa pasa \" Pag na-late ready na katawan ko sa bugbugan blues. The next day, pag punta ko kila GF. She use tend to my wounds. Sabi ko ok lang yun...minsan kapag trouble sa school. Ayaw na makipag-away sakin kasi nga kapag nakikipagsuntukan ako, yun parang wala nakong paki-elam. Di nako nasasaktan eh, yun pananakit nila eh wala ng epekto or hindi ko na na-fee-feel yun pag-inflict nila ng physical damage. Tapos all-out ako makipag-basagan ng mukha. Buti nalang la naging mga peklat sa mukha ko... \n My Dad was proud only at one thing, di siya nagagalit na malalaman niya na nakipagsuntukan ako, pag uwi ko he sees my face bruised, lips are cut. He'll only ask one thing. \" Nasaktan ka? siguraduhin mong nasa tama ka. Labhan mo na yan damit mo, magagalit nanay mo pag nakitang may dugo yan \" and this was grade3 or grade 4. \n Madami pang story ang nangyari until nun college nako. We were asked to write an essay. Madaming topic to choose from pero isa yun pinili ko. \" The most memorable person \" \n Typically, I should have wrote my mom. Pero instead I wanted to be different. I wrote my dad instead. The composition of the letter was very ironic. I wrote halos kapareho nun post ko dito lahat nun pambubugbog niya, pero nilagay ko sa latter part nun letter. Never akong nagalit or nag-rebelde sa Dad ko. But I always kept on asking one and always the same question....\" Why?\" \n nilagay ko yun irony nun mga ginawa sakin like... \n through tears I learn to smile through pain I learn to love through hate I learn compassion through the bruises I learn to hug and make people smile through the cuts I learn to care and to mend broken hearts \n things like that yun sinulat ko sa last part. And my dad thus made me this way, I'll never forget him and he's the most memorable person. Who molded me, creating me of who I am. \n Balewala sakin yun, gusto ko lang isulat yun past ko. Tapos di ko one day, our Prof came into our room with tears in her eye. She told us about the essay she asked us to do. Eh gags ako nun sa school. I teased pa na ang cheesy naman nun nagpaiyak kay Ma'am. She then blurted out my name and yun piece ko. She ask me to read it in front of the class. Natatawa pa ko and reasoned na Ma'am seryoso kayu? So ayun, no choice but to read it, Read it as fast as I could, I put no feelings when I read out the words. Nun matatapos na, saw my fellow students...teary eyed. Upo lang ako, and my Prof asks for my permission if she could get a copy. sabi ko no prob. Ayun ang dami nila nagpa-photocopy, mostly mga babae. Di pa natapos story nun, paguwi ko ng bahay, a month passed ata. when I was about to leave our house for another week for school ( sa manila nako nag-cocollege that time ) my dad held my shoulders and said... \" May naiwan ka na yellow pad, assignment niyo ata \" isip ako ng sip kung anu yun until he said na \" Memorable person yun title \".. he looked into straight into my eye, as if he has seen my soul. Gusto kong pumikit that time and sabi ko patay, the worst thing could ever happened already did happened. He then said softly.. \" h'wag ka umalis, mag-uusap tayu...\" \n My Dad told me to stay for the day, and ok lang daw na umabsent ako sa class. Di ko lam kung ano dapat maramdaman ko that time. Pinagpapawisan ka ng butil butil na malamig, kahit maaliwalas naman ang panahon. He then ask me to buy \" Lambanog \" and some pulutan. That time ang tumatakbo sa isip ko, na iinom siya mag-isa and pagna-reach na yun super saiyan level saka ako hahagupitin, dahil dun sa pesteng essay na yun na hindi ko lam how the hell he obtain that?? I prepared my body for the torture of my life. And there he was, we have a bahay kubo at our backyard, I got the drinks and then he called me up. It wasn't even a call, more of like a \" pakiusap \". he told me. \" Halika dito, maguusap tayu. \" First time I've heard that tone of voice, it was very meek. Aaminn ko, that time mas napraning ako dahil iba yun mood niya. Di ko lam kung paglapit koba eh, bigla nalang ako hatawin nun bote or what. Very cautious ako that time. Di ako umiimik. Then he spoke. \" Inom tayung dalawa. \" First time he ever asked me to have a sitdown with him. One on one. Miinom nako that time, pero not with him. Not that kind of setting. He told his life story, how he was raised up when he was a child. Ako yun nag-tatagay that time. Gusto ko talaga dayain. Ayokong magulpi ng naka-inom ako, di ko lam magiging reaction ko. I was afraid na baka gumanti ako pag binira ako, pero mas natakot ako kasi for sure pag nakainom ako, di ako makakailag sa uppercut, jab, roundhouse and sa fatality. Parang mortal kombat lang. The conversation went smooth, hours have passed. My mom watches us from a distance, maybe preaparing for a bloodbath. I was surprised my Dad, forgot na yun essay thing... \n But I was wrong. He reached down to his pocket. Pulled out th letter. Stared at me. And then asked me to read it. My mom rushed and sat right next to me. My angel my guradian. Thought came passing through my head, I am saved. \n My Dad told my Mom, \" Makinig tayu. \" Inabot na niya yun well-folded na yellow pad. And then I read it. May part dun na sinadya kong hindi basahin. How can I read it? Andun yun \" memorable person \" sa harap ko. Kapag binasa ko yun, 100% yun ang magiging \" memorable gulpi \" ko. My father spoke, gulat na gulat ako. When I skipped a sentence. he told me.. \" Basahin mo lahat, gusto kong marining lahat. Every word you wrote. Read it. \"... I froze and pumasok na sa isip ko that time. He already read it, probably over and over. La nakong magagawa I have to fully read it. I heard my mom crying. I found myself tears falling down my eye. When I made the letter, I made that out of sadness. Emotions came rushing in. And when I read the final words. I looked up at my Dad. His eyes kept closed. I saw tears falling from the corners of his eyes. \n Is this a dream? I came to question myself? Siguro I was drunk?? \n My Dad spoke, his voice was trembling. His eyes still closed. \" The sweetest words I could hear from my son. I never dreamed that I will live the day to hear these words. \" He opened his eyes and said... \" Maraming salamat...anak. I want you to read that sa burol ko. Kapag namatay ako, I want everybody to know what kind of a father I was. \" The most sad thing I ever heard from him. Masahol pa yun naramdaman ko nun nakipag-break up yun GF ko. My heart was shattered. I don't want to see that, I don't want to hear those words from him. Mga profanity, mga pagmumura niya sakin...that I can endure pero yun words na he told me. How he felt bout the letter. I wish I hadn't wrote it. My father's words broke my heart apart. My fear pala is I don't want to see my Dad in pain. Seconds passed, pero it felt like days. My childhood life flashed before my eyes, and then yun questoin ko was answered. \n My Dad looked upon my Mom and said. \" Mi, sabihin mo lahat sa kanya, I wanted him to know everything. Gusto ko sa lahat ng magkakapatid siya nalang yun makaalam. \" My mother held and squeezed my hand..and then she told me everything. \n \" Mahal na mahal kayung lahat ng Papa mo. Gusto niya na matuto kayung maging matibay sa lahat ng bagay at hindi basta basta bibigay o susuko. Lahat ng mapait at masakit pinatikim niya sa inyo, dahil wala ng mas mananakit pa inyo kung hindi yun taong nagmamahal sa inyo at yun ang Papa niyo. Nagusap kami ng Papa mo, we had an agreement. He will be hated and I ( my mom ) will be loved. He will die na alam niya galit kayung magkakapatid sa kanya pero nabago yun dahil sa sulat mo. Nalaman niya na hindi ka galit sa kanya. Hindi niyo lang alam kung gano kayu kamahal ng Papa niyo. Tuwing gabi bago kayu matulog, matapos niya kayung paluin. Siya yun unang nag-aalala s inyo, uutusan niya ako na puntahan kayu sa kwarto niyo para i-check at gamutin mga sugat niyo. Tuwing may pinapalayas sa inyo, siya yun nag-uutos sakin na hanapin kayu. Ang Papa niyo ang nag-aalala sa lahat, siya ang hindi makatulog kapag wala pa kayu sa bahay. Siya ang nagpapahanda ng pagkain kapag alam na pauwi na kayu. Kaya wag niyong iisipin na sa lahat ng pamamalo niya hindi ko kayu tinulungan. Ang gusto ng Papa niyo ay matuto kayung lahat, he will die happy knowing na hindi siya kahit kailan nagkulang ng pangangaral sa inyo. How hard it is for him everytime hinahataw kayu. Ang totoo niyan siya ang umiiyak sa gabi. And he let me do the explanation sa inyo kung bakit kayu napalo. All he wanted is to have his children learn how to stand up on their own. Ayaw na ayaw niya na maging hangal kayu katulad nun mga kapatid niya. At alam niya, na minsan dadating sa buhay niyo, kapag wala na siya. Lahat kayung magkakapatid ma-rerealize that all along your father was right. \" \n All fluids naglabasan sa mata and sa ilong ko. Nasagot lahat ng tanong ko. My father asked me to keep those words within ousrselves and he asked me to tell it to my sister especially my brother when the time is right.

{"id": "summarization_094", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following blog article into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \n People are becoming more and more dependent on technology these days, and it can make focusing on any one task for a long period time a bit more challenging. You may be used to checking your email or phone every 15 minutes, but if you’re really committed to being studious, then you have to work on having intense concentration for 30, 45, or even 60 minutes at a time. You can train your mind to focus more as you build up to a higher focus time if you’re committed to doing so.Learn to monitor yourself and be hyper aware of when your mind is drifting. If something else is bothering you, tell yourself that you’ll devote 15 solid minutes to it instead of letting it interfere with your thinking.\n\nTaking breaks is just as important as focusing. You’ll need to take a 10 minute break at least every hour so that your mind can refocus its energy.;\n, One important part of being studious is paying attention in class. Learn to absorb everything your teacher is saying and to really understand the material. Work to avoid as many distractions as you can and to not get lost in side conversations with your friends. Read along with your teacher and make sure you don’t waste class time staring at the clock or studying for other classes. Make a point of being attentive and of not letting your mind wander; if it does wander, just take a note of it and bring it back.\n\n\nIf you don’t understand something, don’t be reluctant to ask questions; being studious doesn’t mean knowing everything, but it does mean committing to your studies.\n\nIf you can choose seats, then sitting close to your teacher can help you build a rapport with him and to pay more attention because you’ll feel more accountable.\n\n, People who are studious participate in class because they are active and engaged in the learning process. They answer questions when their teachers ask them, they raise their hands when they have questions, and they volunteer for activities when they are asked. You don’t have to answer every question and should give other students a chance, but you should actively and consistently be part of the class discussion.\n\n\nParticipating in class also makes you feel more engaged and excited about the learning material. It can help you absorb the material and to do better in school.\n\n\n, Being studious doesn’t mean pushing all of your other interests aside. However, it does mean that you should make your studies a high priority in your life. When balancing your friends, your family time, and your extracurricular activities along with your studies, you should make sure not to neglect your studies, and to make sure that your social time doesn’t get in the way of your grades. Keeping a planner can help you make sure that you have time for studying along with your other obligations.\n\n\nPlug studies into your daily schedule. It’s important to make time for them almost every single day, so you don’t end up getting distracted with other clubs, hobbies, or social events.\nYou need to learn when studying works best for you. Some people like to study right after school, when their studies are fresh in their mind, while others like to take a few hours off to relax.\n\n, Being studious doesn’t mean being the class valedictorian. It means making a serious and long commitment to your studies. If you expect yourself to be the most high-achieving student in your grade, then you’ll be setting a very high bar for yourself. While this can be a private goal, what’s most important is that you work on doing the best that you’re capable of so that you don’t end up feeling disappointed or inadequate or putting too much pressure on yourself.\n\n\nBeing studious doesn’t mean being the highest achieving student in your school. It means studying to the best of your own abilities, and to always aim for improvement.\nIf you expect yourself to never get a wrong answer, that can actually lead you to feel more frustrated and will make you less likely to succeed. If you get obsessed with the fact that you don’t know the answer to one of the questions on a test, then this will keep you from focusing on the rest of the questions.\n\n, Taking notes in class will help you focus on the material, process the words your teacher is saying, and to stay active and engaged even if you’re feeling tired. You can even take notes with different pens, different highlighters, or post-its to mark particularly important passages. Find what works best to you and be committed to taking the most thorough and comprehensive notes possible if you want to be studious.\n\n\nIf you really want to be studious, then you can work on putting your teacher’s lectures into your own words. That way, you’re not just jotting down everything he says, but you’re making an effort to really understand the material.\nTry review your notes every day so you can clarify anything you didn’t understand with the teacher the following day.\n\n, People who are studious are usually well-organized so that they don’t waste any time looking for their notes, homework, or textbooks. If you’re disorganized, then you should work on having different binders for different subjects, spending a few minutes a day cleaning your desk or locker, and making sure that you’ve split up your work into different compartments so you can stay focus and not get overwhelmed. You may think that some people are just naturally more messy than others, but you can still work on developing the habits of an organized person if you want to be studious.\n\n\nIf you spend just 15 minutes a day putting everything in its place, both in your bedroom and your locker or notebooks, then you’ll be able to maintain an organized lifestyle.\n\nBeing neat is a part of being organized. Don’t throw any crumpled papers in your bag, and make sure to keep your personal, fun items away from your study items.\n\n, If you want to truly be studious, then you have to stop comparing yourself to other people. Don’t try to get the same grades as the girl sitting next to you in Algebra class, and don’t try to get the honor roll like your brother or best friend unless you think it’s a realistic goal. The most important thing is that you do the best that you can do instead of comparing yourself to other people. If you’re too focused on other people then you’ll never be happy with your own achievements and won’t be studying with a positive mindset.\n\n\nThe best thing you can do if you know there’s someone in your class who is more knowledgeable than you is to suggest a study date so you can pick that person’s brain. Think of people with knowledge as assets, not threats.\n\n, If you want to develop strong study habits, then one of the first things you should do is to create a plan for your next study session. If you just sit down with your textbooks without a clear idea of what to do, then you’re likely to feel overwhelmed, to spend too much time on less important things, or to get sidetracked. To make your study time as productive and as efficient as possible, you should block off your studying time into 15 to 30 minute increments, making a game plan for each block of time so you know exactly what to do. Also, create a part of your day that is reserved for studying.That way, you always have time to study.Having an an agenda also makes you feel more motivated. If you have a list of items to accomplish and check them off one by one, then you’ll feel more accomplished than if you were just to study for three hours without any real direction.\nBlocking off each item for a certain amount of time can also help keep you focused. You don’t want to stray by studying something not so important for too long and ignoring more essential concepts.\nYou can also create an agenda for each week or month. If you have a big exam coming up, splitting up the material into week-long study sessions can make everything feel more manageable.\n\n, Knowing your learning style can help you have a sense of how you learn best. Every person has a different learning style, and one method of studying, such as flashcards, may be great for one learner and terrible for another. Many people also fall into more than one category. Here are the different learning styles and some tips for how to study according to how you learn best:Visual. Visual learners learn best from using pictures, images, and spatial understanding. If you’re a visual learner, than charts and diagrams will be helpful to you, as will color-coding your notes based on subject matter. You can also use flow charts when taking notes to have a stronger visual image of the concepts.\nAuditory. These learners learn best through sound. You may learn best by recording lectures and repeating them back to yourself, talking to experts, or participating in class discussion.\nPhysical/Kinesthetic. These types of learners learn best through using their bodies, their hands, and their senses of touch. Though it can be challenging to learn purely through this style, you can help yourself study by tracing words to reinforce learning, using the computer to test knowledge, and memorizing facts while walking.\n\n, Taking breaks is just as important as staying on task when it comes to developing strong study habits. No human is meant to spend eight hours straight in front of a computer, desk, or textbook, and it’s important to take those breaks so that you can regroup and gain more energy to study again. Make sure to take a 10-minute break every hour or hour and a half, or even more frequently if you really need one. Try to get some nourishment, sunshine, or exercise during your breaks.\n\n\nDon’t think that you’re being lazy by taking study breaks. In fact, this will actually make you work harder when you return.\n\n, To make the most of your studying, you should try to avoid distractions as much as you can. Make a rule that you can only go on YouTube, Facebook, or your favorite celebrity gossip site during your study breaks, and turn your phone off during intense study sessions. Don’t sit next to people who are having loud, distracting conversations or who try to make small talk with you. Look around you and make sure there’s nothing that can take your mind off the task at hand.\n\n\nIf you’re really addicted to your phone or Facebook, tell yourself that you’ll study for an hour before you check either. This will get you more motivated to study in the meantime, when you know there’s a “reward.”\n\n, There is no one right study environment for every person, and it’s your job to decide what works best for you. Some people prefer to study in an absolutely quiet space without any noise or people, such as their bedrooms, while others like the more vibrant coffee shop scene. Some people study best outdoors while others can only do their work in a library. You may be studying in the wrong environment without knowing it; try to find the best study space for yourself and you’ll see how much easier it is to be studious.\n\n\nIf you normally only study in your bedroom and think it’s too quiet, try a coffee shop for a change. If you’re sick of the din of a coffee shop, try a library, where you may be inspired by many quiet, studious people.\n\n, To make the most of your studying, you should make sure you come prepared. Wear clothes with lots of layers or bring a sweater so you don’t up getting uncomfortable because you’re too hot or too cold. Bring healthy snacks, such as peanut butter and celery, carrots, yogurt, almonds, or cashews so you have something to munch on that won’t give you a sugar high or make you feel tired. Come prepared with your notes, extra pens, a charged phone if you’ll need it later, and anything else you’ll need to keep yourself focused and ready to get down to business.If you’re really set on a study session, you don’t want it to get ruined because you’re uncomfortable. Having a solid plan for what to bring in advance can help you study with success.\n\n, If you want to be studious, then you should know to take advantage of all of the help at your disposal. This could mean talking to your teachers, friends, or librarians for extra help, using your school library, or reading the online resources and additional recommended reading materials for your courses. The more resources you use, the more likely you’ll be to succeed and to truly be studious.\n\n\nPeople who are studious are resourceful. When they’re not getting everything they need from a textbook, they turn to other people, other books, or other online resources for help.\n\n, To stay motivated during your work to become studious, you shouldn’t think you’ve failed if you didn’t go from having a C-average in Calculus to an A-average. Instead, you should be proud of yourself from moving from a C to a B-minus, and so on. When it comes to being studious and feeling motivated to succeed, you should work in increments or get disappointed and lose steam.\n\n\nChart your progress. When you see how much you’ve improved since the beginning of your commitment to be studious, you’ll be truly proud of yourself.\n\n, Though not every subject in school will fascinate you, you should try to find something you care about in each and every class. Maybe English isn’t your favorite subject, but you’ve found that A Separate Peace or Catcher in the Rye is your new favorite novel; you don’t have to like everything in school, but you should still look for something that truly fascinates you and motivates you to keep working.\n\n\nIf you find just a few things to care about in each class, you’ll be much more motivated to be studious. Remember that you’re not just studying to pass tests, but to truly acquire knowledge, and caring about what you’re learning can really help that.\n\n, Though working with a partner or a group doesn’t work for everyone, you should consider mixing it up and working to be studious with others, sometimes. You can learn a lot from working with other people, and they can help keep you focused and on-track. You may also find that you learn more from a close friend than from a teacher, and that you gain mastery of a subject after trying to teach it to your friends. Consider this study technique the next time you hit the books.Some people are more social learners and they learn a lot better with others. If this is you, then you should try working with one friend first, and then opening your studies up to a study group.\nJust make sure that your study groups actually spend most of their time studying with occasional breaks; you don’t want to get sucked into a situation that keeps you from learning the material.\n\n, Being studious isn’t all about work, work, work. If you really want to make a lifelong goal of being studious, then you have to remember to take breaks, and to reward yourself for taking them. Every time you get your goal grade on a test, celebrate with ice cream or a night at the movies with your friends. Every time you study for three hours, reward yourself with your favorite trashy reality TV show. Find a way to motivate yourself to keep working and to reward yourself for all of the hard work you’ve put in along the way.\n\n\nAny amount of work should be rewarded. Don’t feel like you don’t deserve a reward because you didn’t get the grades you were hoping for.\n\n, Though you may think studious people never have fun, it’s actually very important to remember to relax and take a break every once in a while. If you’re only focused on your studies, then you’ll feel burned out and like you’re under a lot of pressure to keep up. Instead, reward yourself for studying by making time for your friends, your hobbies, or even some mindless activities like watching The Bachelor every once in a while. Taking breaks for fun will actually lead you to enjoy the learning experience more when you return to it, and will help you become studious.\n\n\nDon’t think of a studious person as someone who sits in a dark room with candlelight without taking a break to eat or drink or see the sun. People who are studious can have a good time, and in fact, they are better at their studies because they can relax and take a break.\nMaking time for friends can help you be more well-balanced and will help you put less pressure on your studies. If you feel like all you have going for you is your studies, then you’ll be setting yourself up to be disappointed.\n\n, Another way to stay motivated is to remind yourself why you’re studying. It may not seem to have a meaning when you’re learning about the French Revolution or reading “The Raven,” but all of the little things you study can add up to make you a well-rounded, and interesting person. Getting stellar grades can also help you reach your ultimate education goals, whether you want to graduate college or get a PhD. Remind yourself that, while not every page you study will be fascinating, it will help lead to your future success.\n\n\nIf you get too hung up on the details, or think too much about one test at a time, you’ll take yourself too seriously. It’s about committing to study in the long term, not about working hard for an individual test. If you look at it as a marathon and not a sprint, then you won’t be putting too much pressure on yourself and you’ll still be able to study in the process.\n\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

{"id": "summarization_095", "instruction": "You're a professional researcher. Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nair bubbles can be entrapped in a wide variety of flows with a free surface @xcite .\nsuch entrapped bubbles can have large effects on phenomena such as bulk gas concentrations and sound emission @xcite .\nin addition , bubbles can be a nuisance for industrial processes , where they cause defects , obstructions or noise @xcite .\nvarious different mechanisms for air entrapment have been proposed in the literature .\nfor example , it is well known that the impact of a drop on a free surface ( e.g. rain ) can induce an inertial cavity collapse that results in an oscillating bubble @xcite . at lower impact speeds\n, air films can be trapped between a liquid drop and a liquid or a solid wall , by lubricating effects of the medium .\nsuch a lubricating film can delay or completely avoid coalescence . in the extreme case\nsuch an air film can even cause a droplet to float on the liquid surface @xcite . depending on whether this film simply drains or becomes unstable , air entrainment might occur @xcite .\nhowever , it has been predicted that bubbles can also be entrapped during a coalescence with zero impact velocity , for which no lubricating film develops . in this case\nthe bubbles form by reconnecting capillary waves that result in toroidal bubble rings as described theoretically @xcite .\nin this paper we focus on entrapment of air bubbles that form when a sessile drop impacts with a moving meniscus .\nthis is relevant for applications such as dip - coating and immersion lithography ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_problemsketch ] ) .\ndip - coating is a very common setup both for applications and fundamental studies , where a solid plate is plunged into or withdrawn from a liquid reservoir .\na very similar geometry is present in immersion lithography , a technology used in semi - conductor industry : replacing the air in between a lens and the silicon wafer by a liquid leads to an increase in the numerical aperture of the system , allowing for the projection of smaller structures .\na simplified version of the flow geometry for immersion lithography is sketched in figure  [ fig : chap4_problemsketch ]  c - d ) .\nthe `` meniscus '' consists of a liquid bridge held between the hydrophilic glass plate and a wafer which is usually made partially wetting by a coating . the water will preferably remain in the gap , due to the contact with the hydrophilic glass plate , even when the substrate is in motion .\na first mechanism for bubble entrapment is that at high velocities , the contact line can become unstable resulting in entrainment of a thin air film @xcite or bubbles @xcite .\na second mechanism that leads to bubbles in these applications is due to residual drops , which are left on the substrate .\nthese drops move along with the substrate and collide with the reservoir ( dip - coating ) or liquid bridge ( immersion lithography ) .\nair bubbles are generically entrapped during a collision of such a sessile drop with the meniscus .\nwe present an experimental study on the formation of bubbles resulting from the impact of a sessile drop with a meniscus close to a moving contact line .\nthe sessile drop always coalesces with the meniscus . as summarized in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_overview ] , however , we identified two scenarios for bubble entrapment .\nfirst , when the contact takes place at or very close to the moving contact line ( i.e. at @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the impact height with respect to the moving substrate ) we observe `` floating bubbles '' .\nthese bubbles are spherical and float in the bulk of the liquid bridge .\nsecond , when the first contact between the sessile drop and the meniscus takes place above the moving contact line ( @xmath2 ) also a `` sticking bubble '' can be formed .\nthis bubble is attached to the substrate and moves with the wafer .\nit should be noted that apart from these two cases , the coalescence can also result into no bubble formation , or a combination of floating bubbles and sticking bubbles . as summarized in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_overview ] , this depends on whether or not the airsheet breaks up during the coalescence .    the paper is organized as follows .\nwe first introduce the experimental setup ( sec .\n[ sec : chap4_setup ] ) .\nthen we will discuss the formation mechanism of the two possible types of bubbles appearing during the drop - meniscus collision ( sec  [ sec : chap4observations ] ) , and quantify the size of the entrapped bubbles , as a function of the impact velocity and the size of the sessile drop ( sec .\n[ sec : chap4bubblesizes ] ) .\nthe latter section also includes explanations for the size of the two types of bubbles .\nthe paper ends with a discussion ( section  [ sec : chap4_discussion ] ) .\nthe experimental setup consists of a coated glass wafer ( @xmath3 mm ) clamped to a turntable that is rotated with controlled angular velocity @xmath4 @xmath5 .\nthe rotational motion of the wafer approximates a linear motion in the camera reference frame , due to the small droplet size compared to the radial position on the wafer ( @xmath6 mm ) .\na detailed description of a similar setup is given in winkels et al .\n@xcite . the geometry in which the collision between a sessile drop and a meniscus is realized is sketched in fig .  [ fig : chap4_setup ]\n. a small glass plate ( @xmath7 mm ) is fixed in the camera reference frame at a height @xmath8 mm above the substrate and close ( @xmath9 mm ) to the edge of the wafer . the gap between the wafer and the glass plate is filled with water ( millipore , milli - q , advantage a10 ) resulting in a liquid bridge with a pinned contact line at the hydrophilic glass plate and a mobile contact line at the coated wafer ( @xmath10 ) . with this construction ,\nthe liquid is held fixed in the camera reference frame also when the wafer is rotated .\nthe liquid bridge then slides over the wafer , such that at the front and at the rear of the bridge there is a moving contact line . within the experimental range of velocities , we observe no air entrainment unless there is a collision with an incoming sessile drop .\nthe two main control parameters in the experiment are the size and velocity of the impacting drop . before each measurement a sessile droplet is created on the wafer with multiple drops from a micro - drop generator ( microdrop technologies , md - e-3000 in combination with a md - k-130 dispenser head , single drop diameter @xmath11 @xmath12 ) .\nwe achieve drop sizes in the range @xmath13 mm .\nthe sizes are determined from side view recordings .\nthe wafer velocity , and hence the impact velocity of the sessile drop , is varied over the range @xmath14 m / s .\nthe process of impact and the subsequent bubble formation is recorded simultaneously with two high speed cameras . for the top view a shimadzu hpv1 or photron sa1.1 ( framerates @xmath15 kfps )\nis used , connected to a long distance microscope ( navitar 12x zoom with 1.5x front lens ) obtaining a maximum resolving power of 2 @xmath16 .\nthe side view is captured simultaneously with a pco1200s camera ( used at @xmath17 kfps ) attached to a lens ( jenoptik , jenmetar 1x/12 ld ) . to image the formation of the bubbles\n, the meniscus is viewed from above through the top glass plate , as shown in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_setup]a . in combination with backlit illumination\nthe meniscus turns black , while the wetted area inside the liquid bridge turns bright .\ntypical image recordings are shown in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_setup]b .\nthe contact line of the sessile drop is marked with the yellow line : prior to impact , the drop is hidden behind the meniscus in the top view recordings . during the coalescence\n, the region where the drop and meniscus have merged will actually turn bright and can thus be monitored very accurately .\nnote that the white ring that appears in the bright part of the image is an optical artefact without fluid mechanical meaning ( see fig .\n[ fig : chap4_floating]a ) .\nfinally , we note that the liquid bridge can exhibit a rather complex geometry .\nthe meniscus can be convex or concave depending on the gap height , volume of liquid and the dynamic contact angle . throughout our experiments\nwe have tuned these parameters in order to keep the impacting meniscus as `` flat '' as possible in the side view . by avoiding strongly concave or convex menisci ,\nwe have been able to obtain conditions where the bubble formation is highly reproducible .\nnamely , the geometry of impact is then a spherical cap with angle @xmath18 , colliding with a meniscus that can be approximated by a `` plane '' with dynamic contact angle @xmath19 .\nthen a simple geometrical argument suggests that if @xmath20 , @xmath21 , while if @xmath22 , @xmath23 .\nthe combination with for example the dynamic contact angle as a function of velocity , would give a possible predictive tool for the impact height @xmath1 as a function of velocity  provided that meniscus profile can be kept perfectly flat .\nin our experiments we observe the impact height from the top view measurements and investigate the resulting coalescence dynamics and possible bubble formation process .\nwe first consider the case where the coalescence is initiated at the contact line , with impact height @xmath0 within experimental accuracy .\nthe subsequent coalescence is directed upwards , away from the substrate .\nthe outcome of the experiment is that either a floating bubble is formed inside the liquid , or no bubble is formed .\nfigure  [ fig : chap4_floating ] shows a typical image sequence in the case a floating bubble is entrapped .\nbelow the experimental stills we provide sketches of the side view , to clarify the various stages of the bubble formation .\nthese sketches serve as illustration and do not provide a fully accurate description of the deformation .    a sessile droplet with size @xmath24 , moves from left to right with velocity @xmath25 ( fig.[fig : chap4_floating]i ) .\nthe yellow solid line indicates the contact line of the sessile drop which is hidden behind the black meniscus prior to impact .\nthe white dashed line denotes the moving contact line of the meniscus .\ninterestingly , a small deformation of the contact line can be observed at time @xmath26 @xmath27 before impact ( white arrow , fig .\n[ fig : chap4_floating ] , @xmath28 @xmath27 ) .\nthis deformation is due to the lubrication pressure building up in the air between the drop and the meniscus .\nsubsequently , the coalescence process starts at , or at least very close to , the contact line ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_floating]ii ) . during the upward motion of the coalescing bridge a pocket of air is enclosed , resulting into a floating bubble ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_floating]iii ) .\nthe coalescence continues while the spherical bubble floats inside the liquid bridge ( @xmath29 @xmath27 , fig.[fig : chap4_floating ] ) .\nthe floating bubble is stable and remains inside the liquid bridge also after drop collision ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_floating]iv ) .\nanother type of bubble that can be entrapped is a sticking bubble , attached to the substrate after its formation .\nthese sticking bubbles form a spherical cap with a finite contact angle , and arise when the initial contact between the drop and the substrate occurs at a finite height above the substrate , @xmath2 .\nthe process of sticking bubble formation is clearly revealed in the top view recordings as shown in figure  [ fig : chap4_cl ] .\nonce more , we complement the still images with side view sketches to clarify the process of bubble formation ( i - iv ) .\nit should be noted that in comparison with fig .  [\nfig : chap4_floating ] , besides the impact height @xmath2 also the drop size @xmath24 is different .\nhowever as will be shown later this does not affect the phenomenon .    at very short time before impact ( @xmath30 @xmath31s , fig .\n[ fig : chap4_cl]i ) , the drop - meniscus separation distance is very small and the sessile drop is indicated by the yellow circle . once again , the meniscus is completely black and the drop moves in from the left with velocity @xmath25 , hidden behind the meniscus in this top view .\nthe moving contact line of the meniscus is slightly curved and indicated by the white dashed line .\nafter several microseconds , @xmath32 @xmath27 , one clearly observes that contact has occurred at a finite height above the substrate .\nthe bridge connecting the drop and the meniscus appears as a bright ellipsoidal area ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_cl]ii ) .\ncoalescence is initiated in all directions , and the downward part of the bridge approaches the substrate ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_cl ] , @xmath33 @xmath27 ) . during this rapid motion ,\nthe air is confined in a cylindrical cap that is squeezed between the wafer and the downward coalescing front . at the final stage of bubble formation\n, this cylindrical shape pinches off symmetrically along the wafer ( up- and downwards in the image ) , leaving a small `` satellite '' bubble at the substrate . this sticking bubble ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_cl]iii , @xmath34 @xmath27 , red dashed circle ) , moves with the substrate .\nthe coalescence also proceeds in the upward direction , away from the contact line . in some experiments\nwe have seen that this can also result into a floating bubble , in analogy to those described in sec .\n[ subsec : chap4er_floating ] .\nwe now investigate the size of the entrapped bubbles , characterized by the radius @xmath35 , for different impact conditions .\nin particular , we vary the size of the sessile drop , @xmath24 , and the impact velocity , @xmath25 .\nour measurements are summarized in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_expdata ] .\nthe triangles ( @xmath36 , , ) show data obtained for floating bubbles , for @xmath37 - @xmath38 m / s and @xmath39-@xmath40 mm in radius .\nthe blue squares ( ) are results for sticking bubbles , for the impact velocities @xmath41 m / s and @xmath42 mm .\neach data point corresponds to a single collision , and the error bars represent the accuracy of resolution .\none clearly observes that the two different types of bubbles display very different sizes , originating from the different mechanisms of their formation . for floating bubbles ,\nthe general trend is that @xmath35 increases with impact velocity .\nhowever , for a given velocity there is a rather large spread of the data .\nwe show below that this can be attributed to the different sizes of impacting drops .\nthis is also why @xmath35 is lower for the largest impact velocities , which were obtained for relatively small drops .\nthe results for sticking bubbles are very different : within our experimental resolution , the bubble size is independent of both the impact velocity and of the radius of impacting drop .\nthe size of sticking bubbles is approximately @xmath43 m , which is much smaller than the floating bubbles .      as observed in sec .\n[ subsec : chap4er_floating ] , the meniscus is weakly distorted already before the coalescence starts ( arrow fig .\n[ fig : chap4_floating ] , @xmath28 @xmath27 ) .\nthis suggests that a pressure builds up inside the air layer in between the drop and meniscus , which is sufficiently strong to deform the liquid interfaces prior to impact .\nin fact , this effect is well - known for drop impact on a solid or on a liquid reservoir @xcite .\nas the air is squeezed out of the narrow gap , the viscous air flow leads to a lubrication pressure inside the layer .\nthe volume of the entrapped air sheet ultimately determines the size of the air bubble .\nwe therefore propose that the lubrication pressure is responsible for the velocity dependence of @xmath35 . as the pressure originates from the dynamical viscosity of the gas , @xmath44 , it is natural to re - plot the experimental data in terms of the capillary number @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the surface tension ( even though we did not explicitly vary the gas viscosity @xmath44 and surface tension @xmath46 ) .\nfigure  [ fig : chap4_floatingratio ] shows the data in dimensionless form , where we scaled the bubble radius by the radius of the impacting drop . in comparison to fig .\n[ fig : chap4_expdata ] , we indeed observe that the rescaled bubble sizes are nicely aligned , and display a monotonic increase with @xmath47 .\nthe scatter is comparable to the experimental error in determining the bubble radius .\nthe data are reasonably described by a power - law over more than a decade in @xmath47 .\nwe now rationalize this dependence on @xmath47 by drawing the analogy with drop impact on a solid substrate @xcite .\nthe geometry of this impact is sketched in fig .\n[ fig : fig_chap4_dropdeformation ] , and is actually much simpler than the geometry of fig .\n[ fig : chap4_problemsketch ] .\nwhile the drop approaches the substrate with velocity @xmath25 , the thickness of the air layer reduces and air is squeezed out . as long as the lubrication pressure , @xmath48 , is significantly smaller than the capillary pressure inside the drop , @xmath49 , the drop remains spherical . in this regime\nthe drop is undeformed and the shape of the air layer is described by @xmath50 .\nthen , the lubrication pressure can be computed exactly @xcite .    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the gap thickness at @xmath53 .\nfrom this equation , it is clear that the typical lateral length scale of the lubricating pressure is , @xmath54 .    to estimate at what distance @xmath52 the drop will start to deform , we balance @xmath55 . note that this is different from @xcite , in which @xmath56 is balanced with the inertial pressure inside the liquid .\nin the experiments presented in this paper the impact velocities and drop impact size are smaller than @xcite , such that the inertial pressure is in fact sub - dominant compared to the capillary pressure . for the smallest drop size and lowest velocities ,\nit is relevant to question whether viscous effects inside the drop come into play  @xcite .\nhowever , an estimation of the smallest reynolds number , re @xmath57 , shows that viscous effects in the liquid are comparable to inertia , and therefore are sub - dominant as well .\nthe visco - capillary balance yields a characteristic height for the dimple below the drop @xmath58 ( fig .\n[ fig : fig_chap4_dropdeformation ] ) :    @xmath59    this determines the distance at which the drop first deforms , and provides the natural length scale for the dimple size in the direction normal to the wall . in a very short time ( @xmath60 ms ) the deformation finally leads to very fast coalescence during which the lubricating air sheet is trapped and forms a bubble .\nthe volume of the air pocket , and hence of the bubble , is expected to scale as    @xmath61    despite the obvious difference in impact geometry , this scaling argument is consistent with the experimental data for the floating bubbles that form during the impact of a sessile drop with a meniscus .\nthis suggests that the bubble volume is indeed governed by the lubrication effect of the squeezed gas layer .\nclearly , a much more detailed modelling of the impact geometry , and the subsequent drainage of air , is required to confirm this scenario .\nhow can we understand that the size of sticking bubbles is independent of @xmath25 ?\nthe key is that the coalescence of the meniscus and drop in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_cl ] , leading to the air confinement at the substrate , is much faster than the impact velocity @xmath25 .\nthis is quantified in fig .\n[ fig : fig_chap4_coalescence ] , where we plot the growth of the coalescing bridge in time .\nthe bridge radius @xmath62 approximately grows as @xmath63 ( best fit : @xmath64 ) , which is comparable to the standard inertia - dominated coalescence of two free droplets @xcite .\nthe fact that the exponent is slightly larger than 1/2 is consistent with recent measurements on water drops , signalling a crossover to a viscosity - dominated coalescence @xcite . a power - law with exponent smaller than unity implies a very rapid dynamics at the initial stages .\nfrom the perspective of bubble entrapment , this means that speed with which the cylindrical cap of air is squeezed ( fig .\n[ fig : chap4_cl ] ) , is much faster than the actual impact velocity of the sessile drop . this explains why @xmath25 is irrelevant for the size of the sticking bubbles .\nit still remains a question why the size of sticking bubbles is also independent of the drop radius @xmath24 .\na closer look at the sticking bubble formation , reveals a striking analogy with the pinch - off process of a buoyant air bubble from a nozzle in water , such as visualized by burton et al  @xcite and shown in a time sequence in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_pinchoff]b .\nthe first image per row is a three dimensional sketch of the liquid gas interface in each configuration .\napart from the presence of the substrate , the geometry of the liquid - gas meniscus is very similar in case of the sticking bubble formation . for the buoyant bubble\n, the detachment of the large bubble occurs by the breakup of a slender cylindrical neck . during this breakup ,\nsmall satellite bubbles of approximately @xmath65 microns diameter are formed at the middle of the neck . according to @xcite ,\nthe size of these satellites can be attributed to the inertia in the gas phase , which becomes relevant during the final stages of pinch - off .\nindeed , we observe a very similar breakup of the cylindrical cap in figure  [ fig : chap4_pinchoff]a .\nthe main difference with respect to burton et al .\n@xcite is that in our case the cylinder of air is attached to the surface . however ,\nthe time scale for breakup and the size of the satellite bubble are almost the same in both experiments .\nclearly , the size of the impacting drop is completely irrelevant during this final stage of the bubble formation .\nin conclusion , the sticking bubbles display a universal size due to a combination of two classical singularities : coalescence and breakup .\nfirst , the growth of the coalescing bridge is extremely fast , making the impact velocity of the sessile drop irrelevant .\nit confines the air between the coalescing bridge and the substrate into a cylindrical air pocket .\nthis cylinder of air undergoes a pinch - off , similar to @xcite .\nwhat remains is a small bubble that is completely independent of impact conditions .\nwe have identified two types of bubbles that form during the impact of a sessile drop with a meniscus . as summarized in fig .  [\nfig : chap4_overview ] , the formation crucially depends on the height of the initial contact . when the first contact occurs at @xmath0 the resulting bubbles are `` floating '' inside the liquid .\nthese bubbles appear due to the entrapment of a lubricating air film , in analogy for bubble entrapment below drops falling on a solid surface .\nthe bubble sizes increase in size with increasing impact velocity , consistent with a scaling argument @xmath66 .\nby contrast at finite impact height , @xmath2 , the entrapped bubbles are `` sticking '' to the substrate .\ntheir size is a few microns and their formation is completely independent of the size and velocity of the impacting drops .\nthe reason for this is that the formation process is dominated by the very fast coalescence , followed by the very fast pinchoff of an air cylinder .\nour findings will be of interest for applications such as coating and immersion lithography .\ncollisions between drops and the meniscus can occur in these geometries , but bubbles are usually not desired .\nwe have shown that bubble sizes are strongly reduced when the initial contact occurs at a finite height above the substrate , which can be achieved by tuning the wettability of the substrate .\nhowever , we emphasize here that the geometry of impact can be much more complicated than the conditions studied in this paper . in our experiments\nwe avoided strongly convex or concave menisci , such that the small sessile drops always impact a nearly flat meniscus .\nmeniscus curvature indeed has a strong influence , in particular on the drainage dynamics of the air film . as mentioned in fig .\n[ fig : chap4_overview ] , the upward coalescence does not always lead to the entrapment of a bubble .\nwe have not been able to quantify the parameters that determine whether or not a floating bubble will form .\nthis remains an important open question , which needs to be answered to verify the validity of simple geometric arguments as a predictive tool .\nthe importance of geometry is illustrated in fig .\n[ fig : fig_chap4_discussion ] , reporting the impact of a relatively large drop , with a drop size comparable to the height of the liquid bridge . in that case , the shape of the air sheet and the subsequent drainage dynamics is strongly affected ( @xmath24 becomes comparable with the radius of curvature of the meniscus ) .\none can clearly observe the destabilization of the air sheet , and how this results into multiple small bubbles .\nthis is very different from the impact of small drops , for which we always observed break - up of a single filament .\nwe speculate that the relevant parameter is the drop size in relation to the relevant dimensions of the meniscus , such as its curvature or its height , but this remains to be investigated .\nalso , in the theoretical approach we have focused on the cases where the impact is normal to the contact line of the meniscus .\nan inclined impact , could of course have an effect on the symmetry and build up of the lubricating air film , and the subsequent coalescence process .\nit would be interesting to investigate these effects in more detail , both experimentally and numerically .\nthis work is part of the research programme contact line control during wetting and dewetting ( clc ) of the stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom) , which is financially supported by the nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek ( nwo). the clc programme is cofinanced by asml and oce.                                                                    wilco bouwhuis , roeland c.  a. van  der veen , tuan tran , diederik  l. keij , koen  g. winkels , ivo  r. peters , devaraj van  der meer , chao sun , jacco  h. snoeijer , and detlef lohse .\nmaximal air bubble entrainment at liquid drop impact . , \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

", "response": "\n\nThis study investigates the formation of air bubbles when a sessile drop impacts a moving meniscus, a phenomenon relevant in applications like dip-coating and immersion lithography. The researchers hypothesize that bubble entrapment depends on the impact velocity and the size of the sessile drop. They conducted high-speed imaging experiments to observe and quantify bubble formation under controlled conditions.\n\nThe main findings demonstrate two distinct types of bubbles: \"floating\" and \"sticking.\"  \n\nFloating bubbles form when the sessile drop initially contacts the meniscus at or very close to the moving contact line, and their size increases with impact velocity. This trend is attributed to the lubrication pressure generated by the air layer between the drop and the meniscus, leading to the entrapment of a larger air pocket.\n\nSticking bubbles, on the other hand, form when the initial contact occurs above the moving contact line. Their size is significantly smaller than floating bubbles and remains independent of both impact velocity and drop size. This finding is explained by the rapid coalescence of the meniscus and drop, which confines the air into a cylindrical cap that breaks up, resulting in a small, fixed-size bubble.\n\nThe study concludes that understanding bubble formation mechanisms during drop-meniscus collisions is crucial for optimizing processes like coating and immersion lithography, where bubble presence is often undesirable. \n\nThe authors suggest that future research could explore the influence of meniscus curvature and inclined impact angles on bubble formation, as these factors may significantly impact air sheet dynamics and subsequent bubble entrapment.\n"}

Summarize the following academic article to a comprehensive abstract, ensuring that all key findings, methodologies, and conclusions are incorporated.\n[Text Start]: \nsolar corona and its extraordinary high temperature has been the topic of various debates and studies from several decades ago .\nthe origin and the source of coronal continual heating and high temperature have been related to coronal loops .\nthe claim that the coronal loops and their behaviors such as their damping oscillations may be one of the main reasons of coronal heating , has been investigated through several studies so far .\ntransverse oscillations of coronal loops have been observed by the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) for several years ( see e.g. aschwanden et al .\n1999 ; schrijver @xmath0 brown 2000 ) .\nnakariakov et al .\n( 1999 ) interpreted these oscillations as fast kink modes with the period ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 min and decay time from @xmath3 to @xmath4 min .\nthe observed values of the periods and decay times make it possible to obtain indirect information on the conditions of the plasma and magnetic field in coronal loops .\nofman @xmath0 aschwanden ( 2002 ) used the data deduced by aschwanden et al .\n( 2002 ) to investigate the oscillations of 11 coronal loops .\nthey argued that the observed trace loops consist of multiple unresolved thin loop threads which produce inhomogeneous internal structure of the observed loop .\nthey adopted 1-dimensional cartesian slabs of plasma with the magnetic field lines in the @xmath5-direction and the direction of the inhomogeneity along the @xmath6-axis normal to the magnetic surfaces , as a simple model for the oscillating loops .\nthey found that the dependence of the decay time on both the length @xmath7 and the width @xmath8 of the loop is in excellent agreement with the power law damping predicted by phase mixing .\nthe property of resonant absorption as a non - thermal mechanism makes it possible to describe the heating of magnetic loops in solar corona as well as rapid decaying of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) waves even in weakly dissipative plasmas ( see e.g. ionson 1978 ; poedts et al .\n1989 ; ofman et al .\n1994 ; erdlyi & goossens 1994 , 1995 ; tirry @xmath0 goossens 1996 ; andries et al . 2005b ; safari et al . 2006\n; dymova @xmath0 ruderman 2006 ; goossens et al .\n2009 ) .\nverwichte et al .\n( 2004 ) , using the observations of trace , have identified the fundamental and its first harmonic of the transverse kink mode in two coronal loops .\nthe period ratios observed by verwichte et al .\n( 2004 ) are @xmath9 and @xmath10 .\nhowever , these values were corrected with the improvement of the observational error bars to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , by van doorsselaere et al .\n( 2007 ) . also verth et al .\n( 2008 ) added some further corrections by considering the effects of loop expansion and estimated a period ratio of 1.54 .\nall these values clearly are lower than 2 .\nthis may be caused by different factors such as the effects of density stratification ( see e.g. andries et al .\n2005a ; erdlyi & verth 2007 ; karami & asvar 2007 ; safari et al . 2007\n; karami et al . 2009 ) and magnetic twist ( see erdlyi & carter 2006 ; erdlyi & fedun 2006 ; karami & barin 2009 ; karami & bahari 2010 , 2012 ) in the loops .\nkarami et al .\n( 2009 , hereafter paper i ) investigated the effect of longitudinally stratification on resonant absorption of mhd waves for both kink @xmath13 and fluting @xmath14 modes .\nthey found that the frequencies and damping rates of both the fundamental and first - overtone modes increase when the stratification parameter increases . also for stratified loops they obtained the ratio of the frequencies @xmath15 of the first overtone and its fundamental mode less than 2 .\nmorton & erdlyi ( 2009 ) studied the effects of both the elliptical shape and stage of emergence of the loops on the period ratio @xmath16 for the minor and major elliptical cases .\ntheir results showed that the parameter characterising the stage of emergence does affect the value of period ratio @xmath16 .\nparticularly , the greatest contribution from emergence to the period ratio occurs when the loop is fully emerged .\nalso they showed that the ellipticity of the loop has an important role in the value of @xmath16 for minor elliptical case but the major ellipse was found to have a less effect on the period ratio of standing oscillations .    here\nwe combine the two models considered in paper i and morton @xmath0 erdlyi ( 2009 ) to investigate of the effects of both elliptical shape and stage of emergence of the coronal loop on the resonant absorption of standing transversal kink oscillations observed by the trace .\nthis paper is organized as follows . in sections 2 and 3 ,\nwe combine the two techniques of paper i and morton @xmath0 erdlyi ( 2009 ) to derive the equations of motion , introduce the relevant connection formulae and obtain the dispersion relation .\nin section 4 , we give numerical results .\nsection 5 is devoted to conclusions .\nthe linearized mhd equations for a zero -

It builds upon previous work which considered the effects of density stratification and emergence on cylindrical loops. The study utilizes a mathematical model describing coronal loops as pressureless cylindrical flux tubes embedded in a magnetic field with density variations along its length and radius. The authors developed connection formulae to account for the elliptical shape and stage of emergence of the loops, considering both minor and major elliptical shapes at various stages of emergence from the photosphere.

{"id": "summarization_097", "instruction": "You're a professional wordsmith. Summarize the following report into a concise summary, ensuring that all essential information is included. \n[Text Start]: \nLetter\nVirtual currencies—digital representations of value that generally are not  government issued—have grown in popularity since their introduction  more than a decade ago. According to the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS), there are currently more than 5,000 known virtual currencies.  Individuals and businesses use virtual currencies as investments and to  make or accept payments for goods and services, among other uses.  These virtual currencies account for the equivalent of hundreds of millions  of dollars or more in daily transactions. The growth of virtual currencies  has raised questions about whether taxpayers who use them are fully  meeting their tax obligations.\nAccording to IRS guidance, virtual currencies are treated as property for  tax purposes and income from virtual currency use is reportable on tax  returns. If taxpayers who use virtual currencies do not comply with their  tax obligations, they contribute to the tax gap, the difference between  taxes that are owed and actually paid. In September 2019, IRS estimated  an average annual gross tax gap of $441 billion for tax years 2011 to  2013.\nYou asked us to review IRS’s efforts related to virtual currency tax  compliance, guidance, and information reporting, which involves third  parties, such as financial institutions, reporting information on taxpayer  income or transactions to IRS and taxpayers. This report (1) describes  what is known about virtual currency tax compliance; (2) describes the  steps IRS has taken to address virtual currency tax compliance risks; (3)  evaluates the extent to which IRS’s virtual currency guidance meets  taxpayer needs; and (4) evaluates whether additional information  reporting could assist IRS in ensuring compliance.\nTo describe what is known about virtual currency tax compliance and the  steps IRS has taken to address virtual currency tax compliance risks, we  reviewed IRS documentation on the agency’s virtual currency tax  enforcement efforts, including information about the Large Business and  International Division’s virtual currency compliance campaign, which was  launched in 2018 to address noncompliance related to the use of virtual  currency through outreach and examinations. We interviewed IRS  officials about any data the agency had on virtual currency tax  compliance. For virtual currency tax compliance issues, we also  interviewed a nongeneralizable selection of tax practitioners, tax  attorneys, virtual currency industry advocates, and virtual currency  exchange executives. We selected these stakeholders to interview using  a snowball sampling approach, and, in total, we interviewed five individual  stakeholders and representatives of 10 entities. We also interviewed  officials from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) about coordination efforts that have been  made across agencies regulating virtual currencies.\nTo evaluate the extent to which IRS’s virtual currency guidance meets  taxpayer needs, we reviewed IRS’s guidance specific to virtual currency,  including Notice 2014-21, issued in March 2014, as well as Revenue  Ruling 2019-24 and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) released in  October 2019. We also reviewed and analyzed all of the public comments  IRS had received on Notice 2014-21 as of August 19, 2019. To assess  the reliability of these data, we requested information from IRS to identify  the quality controls in place to help ensure all comments were processed.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.\nPrior to IRS issuing the Revenue Ruling and FAQs in October 2019, we  interviewed the stakeholders mentioned above to determine any taxpayer  concerns, any compliance challenges with virtual currency tax obligations,  and the extent to which IRS’s guidance was meeting taxpayer needs.  After the new guidance was issued, we contacted these same  stakeholders to gather their perspectives on the new guidance, and  received responses from four of the five individuals and six of the 10  organizations we had contacted.\nTo evaluate whether additional information reporting could assist IRS in  ensuring compliance, we reviewed IRS’s requirements for information  reporting for virtual currency transactions. We interviewed IRS officials  about how IRS’s third-party and taxpayer information reporting processes  and forms assist in detecting noncompliance for virtual currencies. We  reviewed the websites of a judgmental selection of nine major virtual  currency exchanges based in the United States to identify any policies  about tax information reporting. We also interviewed the stakeholders  mentioned above to obtain their views on what virtual currency  information is being reported to IRS; whether additional information  reporting would help to ensure tax compliance; and, in interviews with  executives from two virtual currency exchanges, what burden, if any,  information reporting does or could impose on virtual currency exchanges  and virtual currency users.\nWe conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nIRS Has Taken Some Steps to Address Virtual Currency Compliance Risks and Has Shared Information across Multiple Agencies\nIRS’s Virtual Currency Guidance Meets Some Taxpayer Needs, but IRS Did Not Address Applicability of Frequently Asked Questions IRS First Issued Virtual Currency Guidance in 2014 and Solicited Public Input to Identify Additional Guidance Needs\nIRS first issued virtual currency guidance in 2014, in response to our  recommendation. In 2013, we found that IRS had not issued guidance  specific to virtual currencies and that taxpayers may be unaware that  income from transactions using virtual currencies could be taxable. We  recommended that IRS provide taxpayers with information on the basic  tax reporting requirements for transactions using virtual currencies. In  response to this recommendation, IRS issued Notice 2014-21 in March  2014 and published it in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB) in the form of  answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs).\nIRS solicited public input on Notice 2014-21 through several means.  Within the notice, IRS requested comments from the public regarding  other aspects of virtual currency transactions that should be addressed in  future guidance by providing a physical and email address to which  comments could be submitted. IRS reviewed more than 200 public  comments it received to identify topics that were in need of further  guidance. Our analysis of the public comments found that the most  common topics concerned tax forms and reporting (64 comments),  realization of income (45 comments), cost basis (33 comments), and  general tax liability (29 comments). Other topics included the tax  implications of hard forks and airdrops, mining, and foreign reporting.\nVirtual currency stakeholders we spoke with, such as tax practitioners,  executives at virtual currency exchanges, advocacy groups, and industry  representatives also identified these topics as in need of further guidance.  Additionally, LB&I officials said they held several sessions to gather  information from external stakeholders, such as tax practitioner groups  and state tax authorities, to develop a better understanding of what was  happening in taxpayer communities.\nThird-Party Information Reporting on Virtual Currency Is Limited, and Foreign Account Reporting Requirements Are Unclear\nConclusions\nVirtual currencies can present challenges for enforcement of tax laws,  both because they can be circulated without a central authority and  because complying with current tax requirements can be confusing and  burdensome. IRS has taken important steps to address these challenges,  including issuing multiple sets of guidance to clarify how virtual currencies  would be treated for tax purposes and carrying out a range of  enforcement activities to address noncompliance.\nAlthough IRS’s 2019 virtual currency guidance addressed some issues  left unresolved by its 2014 guidance, it did not address others, and it has  also prompted new concerns among virtual currency stakeholders.  Additionally, including information that the 2019 FAQs are not legally  binding would enhance taxpayer understanding and could ultimately help  enhance taxpayers’ confidence in IRS and the tax system.\nCurrently, much trading activity in virtual currency goes unreported on  information returns. In part, this lack of reporting may be because third  parties are unclear about whether they are required to report. Limitations  in what information returns report related to virtual currencies also  constrain the utility of reported information. In general, information  reporting is associated with high levels of compliance.\nAdditionally, the rules for foreign asset reporting—specifically, the FBARs  required by the Bank Secrecy Act and the separate reports required by  FATCA—do not clearly address virtual currency, and tax professionals  have raised questions about the applicability of these requirements to  virtual currency. Clarifying the FATCA requirements and making a  statement about the FBAR requirements readily available to the public  would help reduce uncertainty about these rules and may result in  reduced burden for some taxpayers who may be filing reports that are not  required.\nRecommendations for Executive Action\nWe are making a total of four recommendations, including three to IRS  and one to FinCEN. Specifically,  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should update the FAQs issued in  2019 to include a statement that the FAQs may serve as a source of  general information but cannot be relied upon by taxpayers as  authoritative since they are not binding on IRS. (Recommendation 1)\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue should take steps to increase  third-party reporting on taxable transactions involving virtual currency,  which could include clarifying IRS’s interpretation of existing third-party  reporting requirements under the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury  Regulations, or pursuing statutory or regulatory changes.  (Recommendation 2)\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue should clarify the application of  reporting requirements under FATCA to virtual currency.  (Recommendation 3)\nThe Director of FinCEN, in coordination with IRS as appropriate, should  make a statement about the application of foreign account reporting  requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act to virtual currency readily  available to the public. (Recommendation 4)\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\nWe provided a draft of this report to IRS, FinCEN, Treasury, SEC, and  CFTC for review and comment. In its written comments, which are  summarized below and reproduced in appendix II, IRS agreed with one  and disagreed with two of the recommendations directed to it. In its  written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in  appendix III, FinCEN agreed with the recommendation directed to it. IRS,  Treasury, SEC, and CFTC provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.\nIRS agreed with the recommendation to take steps to increase third-party  reporting on taxable transactions involving virtual currency  (recommendation 2). IRS stated that it is working with Treasury to  develop guidance on third-party reporting under section 6045 of the  Internal Revenue Code for certain taxable transactions involving virtual  currency. Such guidance, if it aims to increase third-party reporting, would  address the intent of the recommendation.\nIRS disagreed with the recommendation to add a statement to the 2019  FAQs on virtual currency informing taxpayers that the FAQs provide  general information but are not binding on IRS (recommendation 1). IRS  stated that the FAQs are illustrative of how longstanding tax principles  apply to property transactions. IRS also stated that IRS does not take  positions contrary to public FAQs. We continue to believe that including  such a statement would provide more transparency and help taxpayers  understand the nature of the information provided in the FAQs.\nAs we state earlier in this report, IRS has included disclaimer statements  in other informal FAQs posted on its website. IRS could include a similar  statement in the virtual currency FAQs at minimal cost. Alternatively, if  IRS intends to be bound by the positions it takes in the current version of  the virtual currency FAQs, as the response to this recommendation  suggests, it could publish the FAQs in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.  Doing so would render a disclaimer statement unnecessary and would  satisfy the intent of the recommendation.\nIRS disagreed with the recommendation to clarify the application of  FATCA reporting requirements to virtual currency (recommendation 3).  IRS stated that U.S. exchanges and other U.S. businesses play a  significant role in virtual currency transactions carried out by U.S.  taxpayers, and therefore it is appropriate for IRS to focus on developing  guidance for third-party reporting under section 6045, as discussed  above. IRS also stated that guidance on FATCA may be appropriate in  the future when the workings of foreign virtual currency exchanges  become more transparent.\nWe believe that, given the widespread uncertainty about the FATCA  requirements among virtual currency stakeholders, it would benefit  taxpayers for IRS to clarify these requirements to the extent possible with  the information currently available. It may be appropriate to wait for future  developments in the foreign virtual currency exchange industry before  issuing detailed, thorough guidance on this issue. However, IRS could  address the uncertainty about the FATCA requirements by clarifying in  general terms how it believes they should be interpreted in situations  involving virtual currency.\nIn its comments, FinCEN agreed with the recommendation to make a  public statement about whether virtual currency must be reported on the  FBAR (recommendation 4). FinCEN confirmed in its letter that as of  January 2020, its regulations do not require virtual currency held in an  offshore account to be reported on the FBAR. Additionally, FinCEN stated  that it will coordinate with IRS to determine the best approach to provide  clarity to the public regarding the FBAR requirement.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Director of the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is  available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-9110 or mctiguej@gao.gov. Contact points for our  Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on  the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this  report are listed in appendix IV.\nAppendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology\nOur objectives were to (1) describe what is known about virtual currency  tax compliance; (2) describe the steps the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  has taken to address virtual currency tax compliance risks; (3) evaluate  the extent to which IRS’s virtual currency guidance meets taxpayer  needs; and (4) evaluate whether additional information reporting could  assist IRS in ensuring compliance.\nTo describe what is known about virtual currency tax compliance and the  steps IRS has taken to address virtual currency tax compliance risks, we  reviewed IRS documentation on the agency’s virtual currency tax  enforcement efforts, including information about the legal summons IRS  issued to Coinbase and the Large Business and International (LB&I)  division’s virtual currency compliance campaign. We interviewed IRS  officials in the Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) and LB&I operating  divisions, as well as the Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics  division about any data the agency had on virtual currency tax  compliance, challenges in collecting such data, and plans for data  analyses. We also reviewed IRS forms that taxpayers may use to report  virtual currency use.\nWe interviewed officials from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,  Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Securities and Exchange  Commission about coordination efforts that have been made across  agencies regulating virtual currencies. We also interviewed tax  practitioners, tax attorneys, virtual currency industry advocates, and  virtual currency exchange executives about virtual currency tax  compliance issues. We took a snowball sampling approach to identify the  outside stakeholders we interviewed, which involved asking stakeholders  we interviewed for recommendations of others we should contact to gain  additional insight into virtual currency tax compliance, and we assessed  their qualifications and independence. In total, we interviewed five  individual stakeholders in addition to representatives of 10 entities with  expertise in tax issues related to virtual currency. Although results from  these interviews are not generalizable, they provide insight into what is  known about tax compliance and the steps IRS has taken to address  virtual currency tax compliance risks.\nTo evaluate the extent to which IRS’s virtual currency guidance meets  taxpayer needs, we identified and analyzed all of the guidance and  statements IRS has published about tax compliance for virtual currencies.  To identify these documents, we searched IRS’s website and interviewed  IRS officials. According to IRS officials, Notice 2014-21, issued in March  2014, and Revenue Ruling 2019-24 and Frequently Asked Questions  (FAQs), issued in October 2019, are the only IRS guidance specific to  virtual currencies.\nWe also reviewed and analyzed all of the public comments IRS had  received on Notice 2014-21 as of August 19, 2019, to determine the  concerns raised about virtual currency tax compliance. IRS sent us 229  public comments. We identified 25 of the comments as not applicable  because they were not related to Notice 2014-21, were duplicate  comments, or were otherwise not relevant. Two reviewers coded the  content of the 204 applicable public comments and grouped them into 13  different thematic categories. We developed these categories based on  the topics or issues that commenters identified. We assigned each  separate issue raised by a comment to an existing category unless it did  not relate to any of the existing categories, in which case we created a  new category. We also recorded the date the comment was submitted  and the occupation of the commenter, if specified in the comment.\nTo assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed relevant  documentation and consulted knowledgeable IRS officials. Specifically,  we requested information from IRS’s Office of Chief Counsel to identify  the quality controls in place to help ensure all comments are processed.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  The information we obtained from these comments may not be  representative of the viewpoints of the entire U.S. public.\nIn addition, we interviewed the stakeholders mentioned above before IRS  released new guidance in October 2019 to identify any taxpayer  concerns, any compliance challenges with virtual currency tax obligations,  and the extent to which the guidance provided in IRS’s Notice 2014-21  was meeting taxpayer needs. We reached out to these same  stakeholders in October 2019, after IRS issued a new set of FAQs and  Revenue Ruling 2019-24, to determine how these new guidance  documents addressed taxpayers’ concerns. Of the five individuals and 10  groups we initially interviewed, we received responses regarding the new  IRS guidance from four individuals and six groups. The information we  obtained from these practitioners and exchanges is not generalizable to  all practitioners and exchanges because we took a snowball sampling  approach, but the information provides insight into the extent to which  IRS’s virtual currency guidance is meeting the needs of taxpayers.\nTo evaluate whether additional information reporting could assist IRS in  ensuring compliance, we reviewed IRS’s requirements for information  reporting for virtual currency transactions, including the laws and  regulations for foreign asset reporting. We interviewed IRS officials in the  SB/SE and LB&I operating divisions about how IRS’s third-party and  taxpayer information reporting processes and current forms assist in  IRS’s work to detect noncompliance for virtual currencies. We reviewed  the websites of a judgmental selection of nine virtual currency exchanges  for policies or statements about tax reporting, including whether the  exchanges file Forms 1099-B or 1099-K. For the website review, we  selected virtual currency exchanges that were based in the United States  and that were likely, because of their size or public profile within the  virtual currency industry, to have established policies regarding  information reporting. For each exchange, we identified and categorized  any statements on the exchange’s website regarding tax or information  reporting, such as a statement that the exchange does not provide any  tax forms to customers or a statement that the exchange provides  information on a specific form to customers and IRS.\nWe also interviewed the stakeholders mentioned above to determine  what information is being reported to IRS and whether additional  information reporting would help IRS and taxpayers with ensuring tax  compliance. We interviewed executives from two exchanges to determine  what burden, if any, information reporting does or could impose on  exchanges and virtual currency users. We attempted to contact four  additional exchanges but did not receive a response. Because we used a  snowball sampling approach, the information we obtained from these  virtual currency industry participants is not generalizable to all virtual  currency industry participants.\nWe conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAppendix II: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service\nAppendix III: Comments from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\nAppendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

The third-party loan, typically provided by a bank, can have a fixed or variable interest rate, is negotiated between the lender and the borrower, is subject to an interest rate cap, and must have at least a 7-year term for a 10-year debenture and at least 10-year term for a 20- or 25-year debenture. The CDC loan has a fixed interest rate that is determined when the SBA sells the debenture to fund the loan. The CDC loan's term is either 10 years (typically for machinery or equipment) or 20 years or 25 years (typically for real estate).\nThe SBA's debenture is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and is sold to underwriters that form debenture pools. Investors purchase interests in the debenture pools and receive Development Company Participation certificates (DCPC) representing ownership of all or part of the pool. DCPCs have a minimum value of $25,000 and can be sold on the secondary market.\nThe SBA and CDCs use various agents to facilitate the sale and service of the certificates and the orderly flow of funds among the parties. After a 504/CDC loan is approved and disbursed, accounting for the loan is set up at the Central Servicing Agent (CSA, currently PricewaterhouseCoopers Public Sector LLP), not the SBA. The SBA guarantees the timely payment of the debenture. If the small business is behind in its loan payments, the SBA pays the difference to the investor on every semiannual due date. \nIn FY2018, the SBA approved 5,874 504/CDC loans amounting to nearly $4.8 billion. At the end of FY2018, there were 56,601 504/CDC loans with an unpaid principal balance of about $25.8 billion.\nHistorically, one of the justifications presented for funding the SBA's loan guaranty programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage, compared with other businesses, when trying to obtain access to sufficient capital and credit. Congressional interest in small business access to capital, in general, and the 504/CDC program, in particular, has increased in recent years because of concern that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to grow and create jobs.\nCongress authorized several changes to the 504/CDC program during the 111 th Congress in an effort to increase the number and amount of 504/CDC loans. For example\nP.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided $375 million to temporarily reduce fees in the SBA's 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs ($299 million) and to temporarily increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90% ($76 million). Congress subsequently appropriated another $265 million and authorized the SBA to reprogram another $40 million to extend those subsidies and the loan modification through May 31, 2010. ARRA also authorized the SBA to allow, under specified circumstances, the use of 504/CDC program funds to refinance existing debt for business expansion. P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, increased the 504/CDC program's loan guaranty limits from $1.5 million to $5 million for \"regular\" borrowers, from $2 million to $5 million if the loan proceeds are directed toward one or more specified public policy goals, and from $4 million to $5.5 million for manufacturers. The act also temporarily expanded for two years after the date of enactment (or until September 27, 2012) the types of projects eligible for refinancing of existing debt under the 504/CDC program; provided $505 million (plus an additional $5 million for administrative expenses) to continue fee subsidies for the 7(a) loan guaranty program and the 504/CDC program through December 31, 2010; and established an alternative size standard that allows more companies to qualify for 504/CDC assistance. P.L. 111-322 , the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue the fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until funding provided for these purposes in P.L. 111-240 was exhausted (which occurred on January 3, 2011).\nDuring the 114 th Congress, P.L. 114-113 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, reinstated the expansion of the types of projects eligible for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan guaranty program in any fiscal year in which the refinancing program and the 504/CDC program as a whole do not have credit subsidy costs. The act requires each CDC to limit its refinancing so that, during any fiscal year, the new refinancings do not exceed 50% of the dollars it loaned under the 504/CDC program during the previous fiscal year. This limitation may be waived if the SBA determines that the refinance loan is needed for good cause. An interim final rule implementing the new refinancing program was issued by the SBA on May 25, 2016, effective June 24, 2016.\nDuring the 115 th Congress, P.L. 115-371 , the Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency (ACE) Act, amended the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to increase the threshold amount for determining when a CDC is required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan (from if the estimated value of the project property is greater than $250,000 to if the estimated value of the project property is greater than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold, which was increased from $250,000 to $500,000 in 2018).\nIn addition, the Trump Administration proposed in its FY2020 budget request that the maximum dollar amount for a 504 loan to a small manufacturer be increased to $6.5 million from $5.5 million. \nThis report opens with a discussion of the rationale for the 504/CDC program and then examines the program's borrower and lender eligibility standards; program requirements; and program statistics, including loan volume, loss rates, proceeds usage, borrower satisfaction, and borrower demographics. Next, it surveys congressional action taken during recent Congresses to enhance small business access to capital, including ARRA, P.L. 111-240 , P.L. 114-113 , and P.L. 115-371 . \nThis report also discusses issues raised concerning the SBA's administration of the program, including the oversight of 504/CDC lenders.\nProgram Participants and Financing Contribution\nAs shown in Table 1 , 504/CDC projects generally have three main participants: a third-party lender provides 50% or more of the financing; a CDC provides up to 40% of the financing through a 504/CDC debenture, which is 100% guaranteed by the SBA; and the borrower contributes at least 10% of the financing.\nThe CDC's contribution, and the amount of the SBA's 100% guaranteed debenture, generally cannot exceed 40% of the financing for standard 504/CDC loans. It cannot exceed 35% of the financing for new businesses (defined as \"a business that is two years old or less at the time the loan is approved\") or if the loan is for either a limited-market property (defined as \"a property with a unique physical design, special construction materials, or a layout that restricts its utility to the use for which it is designed\") or a special purpose property. The SBA lists 27 limited and special purpose properties (e.g., dormitories, golf courses, hospitals, and bowling alleys). The CDC's contribution cannot exceed 30% of the financing when the borrower is a new business and the loan is for either a limited-market property or a special purpose property.\nBorrowers must contribute at least 10% of the financing for standard 504/CDC loans and at least 15% of the financing if the borrower is a new business or if the loan is for a limited-market property or a special purpose property. They must contribute at least 20% of the financing if the borrower is a new business and the loan is for either a limited-market property or a special purpose property.\nBorrower Eligibility Standards and Program Requirements\nCDC Eligibility Standards, Operating Requirements, and Program Requirements\nProgram Statistics\nCongressional Issues\nLegislative Activity During the 111th Congress\nAs mentioned previously, Congress approved legislation in 2009 (ARRA) that provided the SBA an additional $730 million, including $299 million to temporarily reduce fees in the SBA's 504/CDC loan guaranty and 7(a) programs and $76 million to temporarily increase the 7(a) program's loan guaranty from up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% of loans exceeding $150,000.\nCongress approved legislation in 2010 ( P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010) that was designed to enhance small business access to capital. Among other provisions, the act \nprovided $510 million to extend the 504/CDC and 7(a) loan guaranty programs' fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010 (later extended to March 4, 2011) or until available funding was exhausted (which occurred on January 3, 2011); increased the 504/CDC program's loan limits from $1.5 million to $5 million for regular 504/CDC loans; from $2 million to $5 million if the loan proceeds are directed toward one or more of the program's specified public policy goals; from $4 million to $5.5 million for small manufacturers; from $4 million to $5.5 million for projects that reduce the borrower's energy consumption by at least 10%; and from $4 million to $5.5 million for projects for plant, equipment, and process upgrades of renewable energy sources, such as the small-scale production of energy for individual buildings or communities consumption (commonly known as micropower), or renewable fuel producers, including biodiesel and ethanol producers; temporarily expanded, for two years after enactment (through September 27, 2012), the types of projects eligible for 504/CDC program refinancing of existing commercial debt; and authorized the SBA to establish an alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs that uses maximum tangible net worth and average net income as an alternative to the use of industry standards and established an interim size standard of a maximum tangible net worth of not more than $15 million and an average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carryover losses) for the preceding two fiscal years of not more than $5 million.\nThe Obama Administration argued that increasing maximum loan limit for SBA programs (including the 504/CDC program) would allow the SBA to \"support larger projects,\" which would \"allow the SBA to help America's small businesses drive long-term economic growth and the creation of jobs in communities across the country.\" The Administration also argued that increasing the maximum loan limits for these programs will be \"budget neutral\" over the long run and \"help improve the availability of smaller loans.\"\nCritics of increasing the SBA's maximum loan limits argued that doing so might increase the risk of defaults, resulting in higher guaranty fees or the need to provide the SBA additional funding. Others advocated a more modest increase in the maximum loan limits to ensure that the 7(a) program \"remains focused on startup and early-stage small firms, businesses that have historically encountered the greatest difficulties in accessing credit\" and \"avoids making small borrowers carry a disproportionate share of the risk associated with larger loans.\" \nOthers contended that creating a small business direct lending program within the SBA would reduce paperwork requirements and be more efficient in providing small businesses access to capital than modifying existing SBA programs that rely on private lenders to determine if they will issue the loans. Also, as mentioned previously, others argued that providing additional resources to the SBA or modifying the SBA's loan programs as a means to augment small businesses' access to capital is ill-advised. In their view, the SBA has limited impact on small businesses' access to capital. They argued that the best means to assist small business economic growth and job creation is to focus on small business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint.\nLegislative Activity During the 112th Congress\nAs mentioned previously, Congress did not approve any changes to the 504/CDC program during the 112 th Congress. However, legislation was introduced during the 112 th Congress to change the program, including several proposals to extend the now-expired two-year temporary expansion of the eligibility of 504/CDC refinancing projects not involving expansions.\nProponents of extending the 504/CDC refinancing expansion provision, initially enacted as part of P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, argued that it would create jobs by enabling small business owners to lower their monthly payments \"at no cost to taxpayers\" and \"is one of many things that we should be doing to put more capital in the hands of America's job creators.\"\nOpponents worried that the provision may require funding to cover loan losses in the future, arguing that \"commercial refinancing may pose an undue risk … at a time of significant budgetary constraints.\" Others opposed the expansion of 504/CDC refinancing on economic or ideological grounds, arguing that federal fiscal restraint, business tax reduction, and business regulatory relief would provide greater assistance to small businesses than expanding an existing SBA spending program.\nH.R. 2950 , the Small Business Administration 504 Loan Refinancing Extension Act of 2011, was introduced on September 15, 2011, and referred to the House Committee on Small Business. The bill would have allowed 504/CDC loans to be used to refinance projects not involving expansions as long as the financing did not exceed 90% of the value of the collateral for the financing for an additional year beyond the two years from the date of enactment that was authorized by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. \nS.Amdt. 1833 , the INVEST in America Act of 2012—an amendment in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 3606 , the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act—was introduced on March 15, 2012. It would have allowed 504/CDC loans to be used to refinance projects not involving expansions for an additional year beyond the two years from the date of enactment authorized by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The amendment was ruled nongermane by the chair on March 21, 2012, and was not included in the final version of the bill that was approved by the Senate the following day.\nS. 3572 , the Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small Businesses Act of 2012, was introduced on September 19, 2012, and referred to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the Senate Committee on Finance. It would have allowed 504/CDC loans to be used to refinance projects not involving expansions for an additional year and a half beyond the two years from the date of enactment authorized by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010.\nS. 1828 , a bill to increase small business lending, and for other purposes, was introduced on November 8, 2011, and referred to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. The bill would have reinstated for a year following the date of its enactment the fee subsidies for the 504/CDC and 7(a) loan guaranty programs and the 90% loan guaranty percentage for the 7(a) program that were originally funded by ARRA.\nLegislative Activity During the 113th Congress\nTwo bills were introduced during the 113 th Congress to reinstate the temporary two-year expansion of projects eligible for 504/CDC program refinancing of existing debt, which expired on September 27, 2012. H.R. 1240 , the Commercial Real Estate and Economic Development (CREED) Act of 2013, would have reinstated the temporary expansion of the projects eligible for 504/CDC program refinancing of existing debt for five years following the bill's enactment. It was referred to the House Committee on Small Business on March 18, 2013. Its companion bill in the Senate ( S. 289 ) was referred to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship on February 12, 2013, and was ordered to be reported favorably, with an amendment, on June 17, 2013. As amended, S. 289 would have reinstated the temporary expansion of the projects eligible for 504/CDC program refinancing of existing debt during any fiscal year in which the 504/CDC program is operating at zero subsidy.\nIn addition, H.R. 4652 , the Increasing Small Business Lending Act, would have authorized fee waivers for the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs.\nLegislative Activity During the 114th Congress\nAs mentioned previously, P.L. 114-113 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, reinstated the expansion of the types of projects eligible for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan guaranty program in any fiscal year in which the refinancing program and the 504/CDC program as a whole do not have credit subsidy costs. The act requires each CDC to limit its refinancing so that, during any fiscal year, the new refinancings do not exceed 50% of the dollars it loaned under the 504/CDC program during the previous fiscal year. This limitation may be waived if the SBA determines that the refinance loan is needed for good cause. An interim final rule implementing the new refinancing program was issued by the SBA on May 25, 2016, effective June 24, 2016.\nThe act also eliminated an alternative job retention goal provision that allowed borrowers that do not meet the 504/CDC program's job creation and retention goals to participate in the expanded refinancing program, but limited that participation to \"not more than the product obtained by multiplying the number of employees of the borrower by $65,000.\" \nPreviously, H.R. 2266 , the Commercial Real Estate and Economic Development Act of 2015, would have reinstated the temporary expansion of projects eligible for 504/CDC program refinancing of existing debt for five years following enactment. Its companion bill in the Senate ( S. 966 ), as amended in committee, would have reinstated the temporary expansion of the refinancing program during any fiscal year in which the 504/CDC program is operating at zero subsidy. Also, the Obama Administration had requested in its FY2016 budget request authority to reinstate the 504/CDC refinancing program (without a business expansion requirement) in FY2016 to support up to $7.5 billion in lending.\nLegislative Activity During the 115th Congress\nAs mentioned previously, P.L. 115-371 , the Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency (ACE) Act, increased the threshold amount for determining when a CDC is required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan (from if the estimated value of the project property is greater than $250,000 to if the estimated value of the project property is greater than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold, which was recently increased from $250,000 to $500,000). The act also increased the threshold amount for determining when a CDC may be required to secure an independent real estate appraisal for a 504/CDC loan (from if the estimated value of the project property is equal to or less than $250,000 and such appraisal is necessary for appropriate evaluation of creditworthiness to if the estimated value of the project property is equal to or less than the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold and such appraisal is necessary for appropriate evaluation of creditworthiness). The change was designed to \"remove the uncertainty lenders now have juggling two different real estate appraisal thresholds.\" \nIn addition, S. 347 , the Investing in America's Small Manufacturers Act, among other provisions, would have allowed CDCs to provide up to 50% of project costs instead of up to 40% if the borrower is a small manufacturer and the 504/CDC loan guarantee program's subsidy cost for that current fiscal year is not above zero.\nConcluding Observations\nDuring the 111 th Congress, congressional debate concerning proposed changes to the SBA's loan guaranty programs, including the 504/CDC program, centered on the likely impact the changes would have on small business access to capital, job retention, and job creation. As a general proposition, some, including President Obama, argued that economic conditions made it imperative that the SBA be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations, and create jobs. Others worried about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit and advocated business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small business economic growth and job creation.\nIn terms of specific program changes, continuing the 504/CDC program's temporary fee subsidies, increasing its loan limits, temporarily (and later permanently) expanding its refinancing options, and authorizing the SBA to establish an alternative size standard were designed to achieve the same goal: to enhance job creation and retention by increasing the ability of 504/CDC borrowers to obtain credit at affordable rates. \nCritics argued that these actions might increase the risk of defaults and result in higher guaranty fees or the need to provide the SBA additional funding to cover loan subsidy costs. Others advocated a more modest increase in the maximum loan limits to ensure that the programs focus on start-ups and early-stage small firms, \"businesses that have historically encountered the greatest difficulties in accessing credit,\" and that they avoid \"making small borrowers carry a disproportionate share of the risk associated with larger loans.\"\nDuring the 112 th -115 th Congresses, congressional oversight focused on the SBA's administration of the program changes enacted during the 111 th Congress, the impact of those changes on the SBA's lending, and ways to address and minimize increased costs associated with loan losses. Although there continues to be widespread congressional support for providing assistance to small businesses, federal fiscal constraints may impede efforts to further expand the 504/CDC program in the near future.\nGiven existing fiscal constraints, it is likely that congressional oversight during the 116 th Congress will continue to focus on (1) the SBA's administration of the 504/CDC program to ensure that the program is as efficient as possible; and (2) the program's efficacy in job retention and creation.\n \n[Text End] \n[Requirements]:\n1.

Yeah ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: cows .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: That's a great elk .\nMarketing: Uh-oh , we have a good artist . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: That is really good .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: I'm quite {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: This is my {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , very shapely .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Brilliant .\nProject Manager: That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: that um , that um {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Very nice . Okay .\nProject Manager: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Oh .\nProject Manager: Oh .\nIndustrial Designer: It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Not as artistic as Heather's drawing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Bit more cartoon style .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and {vocalsound} they just know what they're doing .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Basically , that's why I like cats . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Very good . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Great .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} I'll rub that out . There you go . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure {vocalsound} how to draw one .\nIndustrial Designer: Ooh .\nUser Interface: I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes {vocalsound} and they're really easy to draw .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um ,\nProject Manager: I forget her name .\nUser Interface: right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog .\nMarketing: Tara\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: or Tara .\nIndustrial Designer: Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It's a cartoon dog I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . {vocalsound} It's a scary cartoon dog . That {disfmarker} This ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: that does not look like a dog .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It looks kinda like a person . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} We can pretend . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I'm sorry .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} That's Pinocchio .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} It's a dog . {vocalsound} . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's true .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} that don't look like that . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Alrighty . I feel like a robot .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . At first I thought it was a dead leaf .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda {disfmarker} there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this .\nProject Manager: It's kinda like a peacock .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was {disfmarker} This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Very nice . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: Great .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Uh , what do we {disfmarker} Oh .\nProject Manager: Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?\nMarketing: Yes I do . {vocalsound} {gap}\nProject Manager: Yea {vocalsound} Right .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard ,\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um {disfmarker} or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um {gap} selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can {disfmarker} like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .\nMarketing: Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty .\nProject Manager: I'm bad at math .\nMarketing: Okay .\nProject Manager: 'Kay . {vocalsound} Um ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: so now that , um , that is underway , um\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?\nMarketing: I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {gap}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: It's always , where is the remote control ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking {vocalsound} device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , {gap} signal ,\nProject Manager: Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: 'cause it always gets lost .\nUser Interface: Do yous not find that , um , {vocalsound} like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that you don't use half of them . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah , I don't know what they do . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Mm-hmm . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's , that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That's useful .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it is . Yeah .\nMarketing: So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Alright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Any ideas will do that you have at this point .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Could be shaped like a conch ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Can hold it .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} A novelty .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: you know . Be like a shell-shaped remote . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Like , I've seen phones like a {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So , hmm .\nProject Manager: And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover {disfmarker} We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for .\nIndustrial Designer: Industrial Designer .\nMarketing: Interface ?\nProject Manager: Industrial Designer .\nIndustrial Designer: That's me . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Oh , industrial .\nProject Manager: I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , {vocalsound} maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert .\nMarketing: Marketing Expert . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nIndustrial Designer: Thank you .\nUser Interface: {gap} \n[Text End]\n[Requirements]:\n1. Capture the key topics discussed.\n2. Maintain the original meaning and context of the dialog.\n3. Identify the roles of the participants if mentioned.\n4. Preserve a neutral tone throughout the summary.\n5. Avoid adding any new information or personal interpretations.\n6. Ensure clarity and readability.\n7. Provide a long summary to contain all the needed information.", "response": "\n\nThis meeting is the first for a team developing a new television remote control. The team consists of a Project Manager (Heather), an Industrial Designer (Poppy), a User Interface Designer (Tara), and a Marketing Expert (Genevieve).\n\nThe meeting begins with technical difficulties, and Heather attempts to share a presentation. After initial hiccups, the Project Manager introduces the team members and their roles. \n\nHeather outlines the project's goal: to design and create a marketable, trendy, and user-friendly remote control that appeals to a generation seeking a departure from basic designs. She emphasizes the need for the product to be both visually appealing and ergonomically sound, particularly for users with visual impairments.\n\nThe team discusses their initial ideas and potential features. Marketing suggests incorporating a tracking device or signal to locate misplaced remotes. UI points out the prevalence of unused buttons on remotes and proposes a hidden panel for less-used functions. The team brainstorms the remote's design, considering both novelty and universal appeal.\n\nBefore concluding, Heather assigns tasks for the next thirty minutes: the Industrial Designer will begin working on the design; the UI Designer will focus on technical function design; and the Marketing Expert will prepare user requirements for presentation.\n\nThe meeting ends with Heather scheduling another meeting in half an hour.\n"}
