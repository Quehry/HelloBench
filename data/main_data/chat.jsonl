They spoke about mutual things but avoided speaking about either Michelle or Sergio. Just a few blocks away from Yamir's home, where Michelle rested comfortably completely unaware her son was in her long time rival's car, Melissa parked her car and decided to have the talk with Yamir. \"My dear boy, tell me how long you have known about me fighting professionally?\" She asked politely, Yamir was nervous now, \"Just now actually... I promise not to tell Sergio, Ms. Perez.\" Yamir said in a very unconvincing tone. Melissa gave a dissapointed look before getting serious, \"Yamir, please, tell me the truth.\" Melissa asked, Yamir sighed and looked away, he was embarrased but he decided to tell the truth. \"4 years ago, I've known since I was 14 years old.\" Yamir admitted, the conversation fell silent for a moment before Melissa asked another question. \"And does Sergio know too...?\" Melissa asked quietly, Yamir felt bad again, \"Yes, ma'am, he actually introduced me into your first fight. I mean the first fight I saw you compete in.\" Yamir explained. Melissa looked at Yamir with wide surprised eyes, then she sighed. \"Oh my god... I was hoping to explain to him when he was older. But now I'm afraid I need to talk to him about this.\" Melissa said, she sounded worried, Yamir was worried too, now Sergio would know that Yamir messed up and let their secret about knowing their moms secret out. He was even more scared about telling his mom. \"Yamir, you'll have to tell Sergio and your mom about this.\" Melissa stated firmly, Yamir shook his head, \"No. My mom would kill me, please don't tell her Besides, can't we just leave it as our secret?\" Yamir argued. \"Yamir, you are Sergio's friend. he will understand\" Melissa told the young male, \"But he is your son and this is your business, you should talk with him and my mom.\" Yamir insisted. The two argued almost like children, neither wanting to be the person to tell Michelle or Sergio about the secret. After a few back and forth, Yamir had an idea. \"Ok, how about this. Why don't we have this be settled in a match.\" Yamir said, with Melissa looking a little freaked out, \"You wanna go against me?\" Melissa asked, Yamir sighed and laughed. \"No, no. You versus my mom. If you win I'll speak to Sergio and my mom. But if my mom wins, you tell them.\" Yamir explained calmly.\n\nMelissa took some time thinking about what Yamir proposed, the young guy had given a very good proposal and it would her even more reasons for beating Michelle in their next fight, Melissa seemed a little surprised, but nodded in agreement. \"Alright, fine.\" Melissa said, \"I'm assuming you want me to accmodate you to watch the fight so you know who won?\" Melissa said, \"That's the plan.\" Yamir said with a smirk, \"I'll accomodate you, your mom and I are fighting 2 weeks from know in my backyard, privately but I'll sneek you in.\" Melissa said and Yamir nodded his head. \"But fair warning Yamir. While I like and respect you. I don't get along well with your mom. So when you see us fight, I won't go easy on her. As a matter of fact, you should be ready to watch her be pummeled by my fists, I don't want you intervening.\" Melissa warned the young man. \"Understood Ms. Perez.\" Yamir responded. \"Good, now go home, I'll contact you then, love you darling\" Melissa hugged Yamir tight before kissing his forehead and pulling away.\n\nYamir walked slowly until he got to his house, he took off his shoes and entered quietly watching his mom cooking dinner. His mom looked at her son and smiled sadly, \"Hey sweetie, how was the movie?\" She asked as she put the plates on the table, \"It was okay mama. Please, let me help you with dinner.\" Yamir said politely. \"You help me cook dinner?\" Did you go to the movies or is there a special someone making you feel extra nice.\" Michelle asked her son, Yamir felt his face turn bright red, \"Um... something like that mom.\" Yamir stammered, trying to play it cool, \"Well, whoever it is, just make sure to introduce me to her. I'd love to meet the lady who made you into such a charming young man tonight.\" Michelle teased, causing Yamir to blush harder than ever. \"Don't worry mom. I don't want to get ahead of myself.

{"id": "chat_015", "category": "rewrite", "instruction": "Rewrite this for me with full-scale and full-scope depth and detail:\n\n\"Section A: The Cryptographic Core\n\nA cryptographic core can be formalized as a set of mathematical algorithms and protocols that are designed to secure the transmission and storage of sensitive information. It includes a suite of cryptographic primitives, such as encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and hash functions, that can be used to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication to data.\n\nFormally, a cryptographic core can be defined as a tuple C = (G, E, D, S, V, H), where:\n\nG is a key generation algorithm that takes as input a security parameter and outputs a secret key.\n\nE is an encryption algorithm that takes as input a plaintext message and the secret key, and outputs a ciphertext.\n\nD is a decryption algorithm that takes as input a ciphertext and the secret key, and outputs the plaintext message.\n\nS is a digital signature algorithm that takes as input a message and the secret key, and outputs a digital signature.\n\nV is a digital signature verification algorithm that takes as input a message, a digital signature, and the public key, and outputs a Boolean value indicating whether the signature is valid.\n\nH is a hash function that takes as input a message and outputs a fixed-length digest.\n\nThese algorithms and protocols are designed to be computationally secure, meaning that an attacker with limited computational resources cannot break the security of the cryptographic core. This is achieved through the use of mathematical primitives that are difficult to reverse or invert, such as modular arithmetic and one-way functions.\n\nSection B: The Cryptographic Cord\n\nWhile the traditional conception of a cryptographic core emphasizes the set of mathematical algorithms and protocols that secure the transmission and storage of sensitive information, a cybernetics-inspired approach suggests that we should view the cryptographic core as a dynamic system, or what we will refer to as a \"cryptographic cord.\"\n\nIn this view, the cryptographic cord is not just a set of static algorithms and protocols, but rather a dynamic system that is continually responding to changes in the environment. Just as a cord can be stretched, compressed, or otherwise distorted, the cryptographic cord can also be distorted or attacked by various threats, such as quantum computers or side-channel attacks.\n\nTo maintain the security of the cryptographic cord, we need to ensure that it remains resilient and adaptable. This means that we need to incorporate feedback mechanisms that allow the cryptographic cord to respond to changes in the environment and adjust its behavior accordingly.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by incorporating machine learning algorithms into the cryptographic cord. Machine learning algorithms can be used to learn from past attacks and adapt the behavior of the cryptographic cord accordingly. For example, if a particular type of attack is detected, the machine learning algorithm can adjust the parameters of the cryptographic cord to make it more resistant to that type of attack.\n\nAnother way to achieve resilience and adaptability is by incorporating a transdisciplinary approach into the design of the cryptographic cord. This means that we need to bring together experts from different fields, such as computer science, mathematics, psychology, and sociology, to design a cryptographic cord that is not just secure but also usable and understandable by the end-users.\n\nIn this way, the cryptographic cord can be viewed not just as a set of mathematical algorithms and protocols, but rather as a complex system that incorporates feedback mechanisms, machine learning algorithms, and a transdisciplinary approach to maintain its security in a constantly changing environment.\n\nSection C: The Dynamic Nature of Cryptography\n\nThe cryptographic cord is a dynamic system that operates in a constantly changing environment. As technology evolves and new threats emerge, the cryptographic cord must adapt and evolve to maintain its security. This requires a dynamic approach to cryptography that incorporates feedback mechanisms and continuous monitoring of the system.\n\nOne key challenge in designing a dynamic cryptographic cord is balancing security and usability. The more secure a cryptographic system is, the more difficult it may be to use. Conversely, a system that is easy to use may be less secure. To address this challenge, designers must balance the needs of security and usability to create a system that is both secure and user-friendly.\n\nAnother challenge is the need for interoperability. Cryptographic systems must be able to interoperate with each other to allow secure communication between different systems. This requires the use of standardized cryptographic algorithms and protocols that can be implemented by different systems.\n\nSection D: Machine Learning in Cryptography\n\nMachine learning algorithms can be used to improve the security and resilience of the cryptographic cord. These algorithms can learn from past attacks and adjust the behavior of the system accordingly. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to detect anomalous behavior in the system that may indicate an attack.\n\nOne application of machine learning in cryptography is intrusion detection. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to detect patterns of behavior that are indicative of an attack. These algorithms can be used to monitor the system and alert security personnel if an attack is detected.\n\nAnother application of machine learning in cryptography is anomaly detection. Machine learning algorithms can be used to detect anomalous behavior in the system that may indicate an attack. For example, if a user suddenly starts accessing data that they do not normally access, this may indicate that their account has been compromised.\n\nSection E: Transdisciplinary Approach to Cryptography\n\nThe design of the cryptographic cord requires a transdisciplinary approach that incorporates expertise from different fields. Computer scientists, mathematicians, psychologists, sociologists, and other experts must work together to design a system that is not just secure but also usable and understandable by end-users.\n\nOne key challenge in designing a transdisciplinary cryptographic cord is communication between different disciplines. Each discipline has its own language and terminology, which can make it difficult for experts from different fields to communicate effectively. To address this challenge, designers must create a common language and framework that can be understood by experts from different fields.\n\nAnother challenge is the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Experts from different fields must work together to design a system that is both secure and usable. This requires collaboration and communication between different disciplines throughout the design process.\n\nSection F: Future Directions in Cryptography\n\nThe future of cryptography is likely to be shaped by advances in technology and new threats. One area of research is quantum cryptography, which uses quantum mechanics to create secure communication channels. Another area of research is post-quantum cryptography, which aims to develop cryptographic algorithms that are secure against quantum computers.\n\nAnother area of research is the development of new cryptographic primitives that can be used to provide additional security and functionality. For example, homomorphic encryption allows computation to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This can be used to provide secure computation in the cloud.\n\nFinally, the use of machine learning algorithms in cryptography is likely to continue to grow. As machine learning algorithms become more advanced, they will be able to provide better security and resilience to the cryptographic cord.\n\nOverall, the cryptographic cord is a dynamic system that requires a transdisciplinary approach and the use of advanced technologies to maintain its security and adaptability in a constantly changing environment. As technology continues to evolve, cryptography will remain an important tool for securing sensitive information and maintaining privacy in the digital age.\"", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

{"id": "chat_020", "category": "rewrite", "instruction": "Rewrite the entire text below, make it sound more coherent and better. Mention everything in great detail, including Hadithes and Quran Verses. Be very sceptical of the author Mohammad Hijab and also add some additional good arguments:\n\n''Mohammad Hijab’s weak apologetic approach often involves a superfluous waste of people’s time. He fails to address the role of Ibn 'Abbas, a companion of Muhammad who was blessed with the knowledge of interpreting the Quran. This oversight raises questions about either his honesty or his awareness of the subject matter. In the athar, when a man approached Ibn 'Abbas with questions about the Quran’s verses and the creation of the heavens and earth, Ibn 'Abbas clarified their meaning. He explained that Allah created the earth in two days, then the heavens in two days, and finally spread (daḥā) the earth in another two days. The spreading (daḥw) involved drawing forth water, creating mountains, and forming camels and other things. Quran 79:30-32 supports this explanation.\n\nHowever, it is unclear why the Quran is open to varying and conflicting interpretations when it claims to be in a clear Arabic tongue (بلسان عربي مبين). Even its supposedly “scientific” interpretations fall short. For example, Quran 2:29 suggests that the earth was created before the heavens. While some Islamic scholars support this interpretation, most scholars and current scientific understanding do not. Even if the word “thumma” in the verse means simultaneous creation rather than a chronological sequence, it still conflicts with our scientific knowledge that stars, including our Sun, existed before the formation of Earth. The majority of Islamic scholars agree with this interpretation.\n\nTafsir Al-Qurtubi, which Hijab cites as evidence, actually presents a distorted view of the creation sequence. It claims that water existed first, followed by smoke from the heavens, and finally the Earth. Once the Earth was created, other celestial bodies like the Sun, Moon, and stars were formed. This narrative is not in line with scientific understanding and highlights the issue of cherry-picking information to suit a specific agenda.\n\nIf “thumma” indicates subsequent creation, the Quran would be considered false. If “thumma” implies simultaneous creation, it would still be false because it would mean that the Earth and heavens have the same age, which contradicts scientific evidence. With no concrete evidence confirming that Surah 41 vs 11 “thumma” speaks in sequence, it appears that people are exhausting themselves in an attempt to rectify an apparent fault. The subsequent assertion that stars were placed in the lower heavens after the Earth and food were created is highly questionable. The Quran’s unclear and potentially chronological sequence raises doubts about its credibility and presents it as a confusing puzzle for readers.\n\nThe creation of Earth and the stars is a subject that has long been debated in both religious and scientific circles. This article examines the Quranic account of creation, focusing primarily on verses 41:9-12 and 2:29, which seemingly describe the Earth as being fully formed before the stars. This is then compared and contrasted with modern scientific knowledge of the chronological formation of these celestial bodies.\n\nIn contemporary scientific understanding, the elements comprising the Earth’s crust and core were initially formed through the process of nucleosynthesis in stars. When these stars exploded as supernovas, they dispersed the elements which would later be used to form solar systems, including our own. Modern radiometric dating techniques have been employed to measure meteorites and lunar and terrestrial rocks, with results indicating that the Earth, Moon, Sun, and other planets were all formed around 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nIn the Quran, however, a different creation story is presented. In verses 41:9-12, the Earth is described as already existing while the heavens were merely smoke. The sequence of creation is as follows: the heavens and the Earth are completed; then, the heavens are divided into seven distinct layers, each of which is assigned its own purpose. Finally, the nearest heaven is adorned with lamps, or stars, and guarded.\n\nQuran 2:29 supports this account by emphasizing that the heavens were fashioned into seven layers only after everything on Earth was created:\n\n“He it is Who created for you all that is in the Earth. Then turned He to the heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of all things.” (Quran 2:29)\n\nIn Quranic verses 41:12 and 67:5, the term “lamps” (masabeeha مَصَٰبِيحَ) is significant, as it suggests that the celestial bodies responsible for emitting light, such as stars, were created after the Earth. These bodies, referred to as kawakib (كَوَاكِبِ) in Quran 37:6, are also mentioned in Joseph’s dream (Quran 12:4) and the destruction of the heavens (Quran 82:1-2).\n\nNonetheless, some modern Muslim scholars argue that the word “Then” in verses 41:11 and 2:29 and the word “fa” in verse 41:12 do not necessarily denote a chronological sequence. Instead, they claim that these words might also mean “moreover,” although this interpretation seems to be in contradiction with the prevalent usage of such words in other Quranic passages, where they typically serve to indicate a sequence.\n\nAnother passage, Quran 79:27-33, appears to present a contradictory account to the one detailed in verses 41:9-12. Here, the heavens have already been lifted and proportioned as a ceiling before the Earth’s surface is spread, pastures are produced, and mountains are fixed. Ibn Kathir, in his tafsir, notes that Ibn 'Abbas claimed that the Earth predates each of these events, while other scholars interpreted the Arabic word dahaha (دَحَىٰهَآ) in verse 79:30 as referring to a particular type of spreading that took place after everything on Earth was fully created. Despite these interpretations, Quran 79:27-33 seems to contradict the creation story in Quran 41:9-12, as it describes how the heavens were “smoke” after the Earth’s sustenance and mountains had been placed.\n\nIn conclusion, the Quranic account of the creation of Earth and the stars reflects an ancient understanding of celestial formation. While some contemporary scholars have attempted to reconcile these passages with modern scientific knowledge, the apparent inconsistencies in the Quran’s description of the creation process ultimately necessitate further examination and interpretation.''", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

Include researched sources. The smells of the damp concrete and freshly baked desserts make an interesting mixture of scents flowing through Chinatown’s narrow streets. The uneven sidewalks and caved potholes made it difficult to walk. The narrow paths stretch toward an urban sanctuary—the grandiose Boston Public Library. Along the walls adorn multicolored country flags swaying slowly in the winter breeze. The soft glow of lights illuminates my face as I pause to observe the activity within a particularly crowded bakery. From outside the windowpane, I hear the muffled sounds of conversations in Mandarin coming from inside. My dad swings the door open, and the conversations are now at full volume. I hear cashiers shouting an order, “Yi ge yue bing, Liang ge dan tuan!” — one mooncake and two egg tarts!\nMy eyes scan the tiny placards perched in front of each delicately baked confection—Sweet bread: $1.20, Red bean bun: $1.40, Pork floss sandwich: $2.00. I stand there for a while, astonished, feeling a mixture of awe and delight. I had never seen such low prices in my life! I thought to myself, I was going to buy up the whole store!\nIntrigued by the prices, I turn to my father with a question tinged with naivety, “How do they make ends meet if they charge so low?” My understanding of the immigrant’s journey, sacrifices, and aspirations was limited then. I couldn’t fully grasp why someone would traverse oceans and continents just to open a small bakery. It was a moment of discovery where my curiosity about the immigrant experience grew. Why has there been a lack of job opportunities for Chinese immigrants?\nJust as the bakery is secluded in the alleyways of Chinatown, so are Chinese immigrants in America. The isolated bakery juxtaposed the sentiments that many Chinese immigrants face in their search for jobs. Frederick Leong, Professor of Physocolgy, outlines Bogardus’s social distance theory that identifies six degrees of social distance in response to racial groups– “a) would allow to live in my country, (b) would have lived in my neighborhood, © would have several families in my neighborhood, (d) would work beside in an office, (e) would have as regular friends, and (f) would marry.” At the fourth degree of social distancing, Americans feel the need to exclude immigrants from the workplace. For me, it is confusing as to why someone would need to express their need to exclude immigrants from their colleagues without knowing the social and economic consequences that it can cause. There is a myriad of systemic barriers affecting a specific immigrant group and it is useful in an essay examining immigration and employment issues. The theoretical framework provides a structured approach to discussing how these barriers exist in systems affecting the career prospects of Chinese immigrants. Director of the Center for Multicultural Psychology Research, Leong, highlights that Chinese immigrants were at the top of the list in terms of social distance and xenophobia during the resurgence of anti-Chinese sentiments in the United States. There are many career hurdles faced by Chinese immigrants in the U.S. Systemic barriers include societal, community, educational, and workplace contexts, which include stereotyping, language issues, social support deficiencies, workplace discrimination, and the ‘model minority’ myth.\n\n\n", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

The pulsating light emanating from it seemed to seep into her very being, filling her with an indescribable power. But as the energy surged through her, she was swept away by a flood of memories from the past, memories that were not her own.\n\nShe saw her late parents, fear etched on their faces, desperately trying to escape the confines of the facility. Panic and urgency laced their movements, as if they were fleeing from something unimaginable. Aelfrun’s heart pounded, and she watched with bated breath as her parents raced through the corridors, their footsteps echoing through the empty halls.\n\nSuddenly, alarm bells blared throughout the facility, reverberating in Aelfrun’s ears. The air crackled with tension, and she felt a chill run down her spine. And then she saw her, a little girl with scarlet wings unfurled from her back, a blue glow radiating from her eyes. The girl unleashed a powerful gust of wind, her wings propelling her forward as she attacked everything in her path.\n\nThe memory was vivid, so real that Aelfrun found herself gasping for air, drenched in a cold sweat. The sight of her parents, the fear in their eyes, and the unstoppable force of the little girl with the scarlet wings left her shaken to her core. What had happened here? Who was that girl, and why were her parents involved?\n\nAelfrun’s mind spun, trying to make sense of the fragments of the puzzle that were slowly coming together. The urban legend of Area 54, the hidden experiments, and now this memory that seemed intimately connected to her own past. It was as if the truth she sought had intertwined itself with her own personal history, weaving a tapestry of secrets that threatened to consume her.\n\nAelfrun clutched the red feather tightly in her hand as she made her way through the ruins, intent on retracing her original path. But as she approached the area where she had initially entered the chamber, her heart sank. The rope she had used to descend had been cut, leaving her stranded inside the forgotten facility.\n\nPanic gripped her as she searched for an alternate route to the surface. The corridors seemed to twist and turn, the once-familiar halls now disorienting and labyrinthine. The damp air grew thick with tension as she desperately tried to navigate the ruins and find another way out.\n\nTime seemed to stretch on endlessly as Aelfrun’s footsteps echoed through empty corridors and long-abandoned rooms. The remnants of forgotten experiments whispered their secrets, but she had no time to unravel them. Her focus shifted solely to survival as she searched for a safe exit.\n\nAt last, she stumbled upon a hidden passage concealed behind a broken wall panel. It led to a narrow staircase that winded its way upwards. Aelfrun’s hopes soared as she ascended, the dim light of the surface growing more prominent with each step.\n\nBut just as she reached the top, her relief turned to fear. A group of agents, clad in dark suits and carrying menacing expressions, stood before her. Before she could react, they pounced, overpowering her and dragging her into a waiting car.\n\nBlindfolded and disoriented, Aelfrun was thrown into the backseat, sandwiched between her captors. The car sped off, leaving behind the ruins that had held the secrets she so desperately sought to uncover.\n\nFor what felt like an eternity, the vehicle traveled along winding roads, veering deep into the heart of the unknown. Aelfrun’s mind raced, trying to make sense of the situation. Who were these agents? Why had they ambushed her? And most importantly, what were they after?\n\nFinally, the car came to a halt, and Aelfrun was yanked out and guided into a hidden underground facility. The smell of sterility filled the air, signalling that she had entered a heavily secured facility. Her head remained covered as she was led through a series of corridors, the echo of hushed voices and distant machinery guiding her way.\n\nWhen the blindfold was finally removed, Aelfrun found herself in a dimly lit interrogation room. The agents stood before her, their stoic expressions revealing nothing. Aelfrun’s heart pounded in her chest as she prepared herself for the questions that would follow.\n\n\nPlease continue the above story to generate the seventh chapter of the novel.\n\nTurning to the Alola region, a sleepy Iolana turns off her alarm clock as a matter of habit. a twelve-year-old girl with long grey hair and what will be, for her, her first day as a new Pokémon trainer, Iolana agrees to go with her best friend Kai to Professor Lillie’s Institute to collect their first partner Pokémon together.", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

Casey published 21 days ago\nPiecing together Marvel's big new show\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Comments (0)\nSamuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in Marvel Studios' Secret Invasion\n(Image credit: Gareth Gatrell / Marvel)\nWe're now days away from Marvel's Secret Invasion, the latest MCU Disney Plus series, and possibly the most important one, outside of say Loki or WandaVision. That said, Secret Invasion is at the center of a weird phenomenon.\n\nPeople don't exactly know it's coming. Even the most die-hard Marvel movie and comics fans I talk to on a regular basis only learned about it last week when I brought it up. So, I thought this was a perfect time to explain what's going on with the series once billed as a 'crossover event,' (Marvel's since changed its language on that page). \n\nFrom its stellar cast to thriller story, which may remind you of The Winter Solider in more ways than one, Secret Invasion arrives with a ton of potential. Here's to know before you watch Secret Invasion online.\n\n1. There's only one Marvel movie you need to watch first\nBrie Larson as captain marvel, standing in her costume in a field, in captain marvel\n\n(Image credit: Marvel.com)\nYou know who Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is, right? You know about the 'blip' event where Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped out half of humanity, only for them to 'blip' back when the Avengers defeated Thanos in Endgame? Well, as long as you know those basics, you only need to have seen one movie.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...\nYes, unlike with many other Marvel movies or shows, there is only one piece of the MCU you should watch prior to Secret Invasion. That's 2019's Captain Marvel, starring Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, the first MCU appearance of the shape-shifting Skrulls. This alien race has a complicated past, and one that Captain Marvel helps explain.\n\nAdmittedly, Captain Marvel has a unique and divisive structure to it that sometimes feels like a snaking ouroboros, but you won't find the MCU's story of Skrull history elsewhere in the movies or shows. Skip that movie, and as Daniel D'Addario at Variety said, you'll be \"on Wikipedia playing catch-up.\" Secret Invasion will try and contextualize the series, but I certainly plan on rewatching Captain Marvel beforehand for a refresher.\n\n2. Expect a grandiose (yet familiar) plot\n\nThese alien Skrulls, though, have become a thorn in the side of good guys, good gals and good non-binary pals everywhere — we just don't know it yet. That's because this shape-shifting species used its powers to infiltrate positions in the highest levels of power around the world. \n\nSound familiar? Well, join us as we flash back to Captain America: The Winter Solider right now, as the memories of top SHIELD brass whispering \"hail Hydra\" to each other is still pretty fresh in our heads. \n\nIt's only been nine years since Winter Soldier, though, so we feel comfortable thinking that it's a little too soon to have a story about how the folks who control the world are evil. No matter how much that conspiracy theory is evergreen to some.\n\n3. This Secret Invasion won't last long\nCobie Smulders as Maria Hill and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in Secret Invasion\n\n(Image credit: Disney Plus)\nSo far, there have only been two kinds of Marvel Netflix shows, and Secret Invasion is one of its shorter adventures, running only six episodes. All other Marvel shows lasted 9 weeks.\n\nSince Secret Invasion debuts on June 21st, that means the whole series will be out by July 26th. So, for everyone who is able to dodge (or doesn't care about) spoilers, and are comfortable waiting until then? You don't exactly need Disney Plus for the time being, you can just re-subscribe at the end of July.\n\n4. Critics aren't exactly impressed\nKingsley Ben-Adir as Gravik in Secret Invasion\n\n(Image credit: Disney Plus)\nAs I'm writing this, Secret Invasion has a so-so 69% Rotten Tomatoes score, made up of some positive reviews that have plenty of criticism, and some completely negative slams. \n\nThe biggest down note comes from the great TV critic Daniel Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter, who called Secret Invasion \"middling\" and \"a disappointment.\" While all critics only saw the first third of the series, he notes that so far \"Secret Invasion is less Cold War and more Generally Tepid Kerfuffle.\"\n\nMeghan O'Keefe, at Decider damned the series by declaring \"The scripts are flabby, the visuals uninspired. Five years ago, Secret Invasion would have been top-tier genre entertainment. Now it feels, like Fury, a few important steps behind the competition.\"\n\n5. But expect a fantastic cast\nOlivia Colman as Special Agent Sonya Falsworth in Marvel Studios' Secret Invasion\n\n(Image credit: Marvel Studios)\nAll that said, I'm still definitely planning on watching. That's partially because its cast is excellent — beyond the folks who are reprising their existing MCU roles, of which there are quite a few. \n\nYes, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is joined by Cobie Smulders' Agent Maria Hill, Martin Freeman's Everett K. Ross (the 'colonizer' as Shuri called him), Don Cheadle's James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (aka War Machine) and Ben Mendelsohn's Talos. Don't remember him? Again, watch Captain Marvel. He also had a small role in Spider-Man: Far From Home\n\nBut that's not the big news: the inimitable Olivia Colman (The Favourite), Khaleesi herself Emilia Clarke and rising star Kingsley Ben-Adir (Vera) are all here. Oh, and Secret Invasion boasts Dermot freakin' Mulroney (My Best Friend's Wedding) as the President.\n\n6. We've already met Emilia Clarke's character\nEmilia Clarke as G'iah in Marvel Studios' SECRET INVASION\n\n(Image credit: Gareth Gatrell / Marvel)\nAnd while the MCU's never met Colman, Mulroney and Ben-Adir's characters before, we actually have met G'iah, the character played by Emilia Clarke. G'iah is the daughter of Talos (Ben Mendelsohn); the two were reunited in the Captain Marvel movie. \n\nIn that movie, a young G'iah became friends with a young Monica Rambeau (now played by Teyonah Parris). One big question is the status of G'iah's mother, Soren (Sharon Blynn), who once impersonated Maria Hill. If G'iah has been radicalized, which seems possible, it could be because her mother met a bad fate.\n\n7. Skip the Secret Invasion comics \nSamuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury entering a mausoleum in Secret Invasion\n\n(Image credit: Disney Plus)\nYes, there was a Secret Invasion in the Marvel comics. No, it doesn't matter here.\n\nDirector Ali Selim told Inverse that the MCU's Secret Invasion is not the same thing as the cross-over event of the same name in the comics, saying “I was told on the first day, don't even bother reading them. It has nothing to do with this series.”\n\nThis is not an adaptation. This is a product of \"the energy that Marvel witnessed when they saw Sam Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn on screen in Captain Marvel.\" Marvel Studio execs apparently declared something to the tune of \"We have to continue this. It's just too electric.\"\n\nMORE FRO", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

Five years ago, Secret Invasion would have been top-tier genre entertainment. Now it feels, like Fury, a few important steps behind the competition.\"\n\n5. But expect a fantastic cast\nOlivia Colman as Special Agent Sonya Falsworth in Marvel Studios' Secret Invasion\n\n(Image credit: Marvel Studios)\nAll that said, I'm still definitely planning on watching. That's partially because its cast is excellent — beyond the folks who are reprising their existing MCU roles, of which there are quite a few. \n\nYes, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is joined by Cobie Smulders' Agent Maria Hill, Martin Freeman's Everett K. Ross (the 'colonizer' as Shuri called him), Don Cheadle's James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (aka War Machine) and Ben Mendelsohn's Talos. Don't remember him? Again, watch Captain Marvel. He also had a small role in Spider-Man: Far From Home\n\nBut that's not the big news: the inimitable Olivia Colman (The Favourite), Khaleesi herself Emilia Clarke and rising star Kingsley Ben-Adir (Vera) are all here. Oh, and Secret Invasion boasts Dermot freakin' Mulroney (My Best Friend's Wedding) as the President.\n\n6. We've already met Emilia Clarke's character\nEmilia Clarke as G'iah in Marvel Studios' SECRET INVASION\n\n(Image credit: Gareth Gatrell / Marvel)\nAnd while the MCU's never met Colman, Mulroney and Ben-Adir's characters before, we actually have met G'iah, the character played by Emilia Clarke. G'iah is the daughter of Talos (Ben Mendelsohn); the two were reunited in the Captain Marvel movie. \n\nIn that movie, a young G'iah became friends with a young Monica Rambeau (now played by Teyonah Parris). One big question is the status of G'iah's mother, Soren (Sharon Blynn), who once impersonated Maria Hill. If G'iah has been radicalized, which seems possible, it could be because her mother met a bad fate.\n\n7. Skip the Secret Invasion comics \nSamuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury entering a mausoleum in Secret Invasion\n\n(Image credit: Disney Plus)\nYes, there was a Secret Invasion in the Marvel comics. No, it doesn't matter here.\n\nDirector Ali Selim told Inverse that the MCU's Secret Invasion is not the same thing as the cross-over event of the same name in the comics, saying “I was told on the first day, don't even bother reading them. It has nothing to do with this series.”\n\nThis is not an adaptation. This is a product of \"the energy that Marvel witnessed when they saw Sam Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn on screen in Captain Marvel.\" Marvel Studio execs apparently declared something to the tune of \"We have to continue this. It's just too electric.\"\n\nMORE FRO", "requirements": null}

Also correct any grammar, structural, or syntax errors in the writing. \"How will technology change our lives in twenty years? It’s a very loaded question in the year 2023. After all, no aspect of life has escaped technological integration. My LG dishwasher has Wi-Fi to send me a push notification when the dishes are done. To keep things simple, I will focus on one aspect of technology: gaming. I will cover three main areas in gaming: graphics, lighting, and graphics cards or GPUs. Today, we will briefly look at what technological advances that might be in store for video games in the year 2043.\nVideo game graphics have developed astoundingly over the last twenty-three years. Once, hideously long ago, computer graphics were two-dimensional and pixelated. These were the dark times so we will fast forward a bit for time's sake. First, a significant bit to know is that everything in games is made of polygons, which are, in fact, triangles made of at least three points in 3-dimensional space. All you really need to understand is the more polygons you have, the more detailed you can make characters and environments look. Back in 2000 A.D., the titular character Luara Croft debuted at an astounding “540 polygons” (halloweencostumes.com). This specific era of gaming in the late 1990’s early 2000s is when 3-dimensional low-poly count characters and levels first debuted in home entertainment. Consoles such as Play Station and Nintendo 64, along with PC, could finally create a more realistic game world at home. That was then, today’s “PC version of Shadow of the Tomb Raider can use up to 200,000 [polygons] for the main character,” (techspot.com). For those of you keeping track at home, that’s an increase of 79,900%! If this trend continues, future video game characters could be made of millions or tens of millions of polygons. Another way of describing this level of detail is photorealism, the term describes a video game that looks like a photograph of a real person and place. The graphics of the future will look like a modern movie, so realistic it’s almost impossible to know what is real.\nGraphics aren’t enough by themselves to make something in a video game look real; there’s light and, just as important, shadow; for most of the video game history, light and shadow were approximated or faked in games to get an effect that looked realistic enough. Then video games got something Hollywood had been using for years called ray tracing. “Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can realistically simulate the lighting of a scene and its objects by rendering physically accurate reflections, refractions, shadows, and indirect lighting,” (nvidia.com). While the technology is still currently in development, and only available in select games to select people, in twenty years, ray tracing should be fully developed and common. Imagine your favorite video game looking as good as Avatar:  The Way of Water!\nOf course, video game graphics, lighting, as well as physics, procedural generation, and every other bell and whistle are all for not without one piece of hardware: the graphics card. This peripheral is often called a “GPU” after the hardware architecture. Graphics cards are complex, “A single GPU device consists of multiple Processor Clusters (PC) that contain multiple Streaming Multiprocessors (SM),” (core.vmware.com). Additionally, current GPUs have onboard 5th-generation graphics double data rate memory or GDDR5 memory. When I really dug into this issue, I was very surprised. GPUs are facing a problematic future because of issues with price, size, heat, and power. \nSome of the first graphics cards by companies such as 3DFX in the 1990s were inexpensive (even good ones), and they provided a fantastic upgrade to video game graphics. Moreover, they took only one PCI or AGP slot and didn’t require extra power. Back then, the cards were small and didn’t produce unreasonable amounts of heat. Many GPUs of the time produced so little heat they didn’t even have a heatsink on them! Flash forward to 2023, and a top-of-the-line Nvidia RTX4090 series GPU was selling for “an eye-watering $1,999” at one point in the year (engadget.com). Oh, and size? Don’t you worry about that. The Nvidia RTX4090 GPU weighs “in at 4.8 pounds,” and takes up not one, not two, but three PCI-E slots (engadget.com)! Makes an excellent space heater for a small room. Why all this background? So, you can see the problem: GPUs can’t maintain this development trajectory. What is the future of the GPU in twenty years? “It would be unfeasible to continue making graphics cards that are bigger and bigger and that require special boxes to accommodate them, right?” (gearrice.com). I know that graphics cards will get more powerful because we can always add more processing power and memory, but that’s how we got where we are now. Giant graphics cards that need a small power plant to run at peak performance. I’m also sure that a way will be found to shrink GPUs, but how is anyone’s guess? No, really, do a Google search on this topic and prepare to find nothing but blogs and forums full of random people guessing. Who knows, maybe someone will finally invent room-temperature semiconductors, and electronics will change forever.\n\tNo matter what history has in store, provided society doesn’t collapse, people will always play video games. At the current rate of improvement in the gaming world, in twenty years, graphics will look like today’s modern movies. Lighting will be indistinguishable from the real world, and graphics cards will either be the size of a briefcase or somehow magically small. Arthur C Clarke said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” so who knows?\"", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

Back in 2000 A.D., the titular character Luara Croft debuted at an astounding “540 polygons” (halloweencostumes.com). This specific era of gaming in the late 1990’s early 2000s is when 3-dimensional low-poly count characters and levels first debuted in home entertainment. Consoles such as Play Station and Nintendo 64, along with PC, could finally create a more realistic game world at home. That was then, today’s “PC version of Shadow of the Tomb Raider can use up to 200,000 [polygons] for the main character,” (techspot.com). For those of you keeping track at home, that’s an increase of 79,900%! If this trend continues, future video game characters could be made of millions or tens of millions of polygons. Another way of describing this level of detail is photorealism, the term describes a video game that looks like a photograph of a real person and place. The graphics of the future will look like a modern movie, so realistic it’s almost impossible to know what is real.\nGraphics aren’t enough by themselves to make something in a video game look real; there’s light and, just as important, shadow; for most of the video game history, light and shadow were approximated or faked in games to get an effect that looked realistic enough. Then video games got something Hollywood had been using for years called ray tracing. “Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can realistically simulate the lighting of a scene and its objects by rendering physically accurate reflections, refractions, shadows, and indirect lighting,” (nvidia.com). While the technology is still currently in development, and only available in select games to select people, in twenty years, ray tracing should be fully developed and common. Imagine your favorite video game looking as good as Avatar:  The Way of Water!\nOf course, video game graphics, lighting, as well as physics, procedural generation, and every other bell and whistle are all for not without one piece of hardware: the graphics card. This peripheral is often called a “GPU” after the hardware architecture. Graphics cards are complex, “A single GPU device consists of multiple Processor Clusters (PC) that contain multiple Streaming Multiprocessors (SM),” (core.vmware.com). Additionally, current GPUs have onboard 5th-generation graphics double data rate memory or GDDR5 memory. When I really dug into this issue, I was very surprised. GPUs are facing a problematic future because of issues with price, size, heat, and power. \nSome of the first graphics cards by companies such as 3DFX in the 1990s were inexpensive (even good ones), and they provided a fantastic upgrade to video game graphics. Moreover, they took only one PCI or AGP slot and didn’t require extra power. Back then, the cards were small and didn’t produce unreasonable amounts of heat. Many GPUs of the time produced so little heat they didn’t even have a heatsink on them! Flash forward to 2023, and a top-of-the-line Nvidia RTX4090 series GPU was selling for “an eye-watering $1,999” at one point in the year (engadget.com). Oh, and size? Don’t you worry about that. The Nvidia RTX4090 GPU weighs “in at 4.8 pounds,” and takes up not one, not two, but three PCI-E slots (engadget.com)! Makes an excellent space heater for a small room. Why all this background? So, you can see the problem: GPUs can’t maintain this development trajectory. What is the future of the GPU in twenty years? “It would be unfeasible to continue making graphics cards that are bigger and bigger and that require special boxes to accommodate them, right?” (gearrice.com). I know that graphics cards will get more powerful because we can always add more processing power and memory, but that’s how we got where we are now. Giant graphics cards that need a small power plant to run at peak performance. I’m also sure that a way will be found to shrink GPUs, but how is anyone’s guess? No, really, do a Google search on this topic and prepare to find nothing but blogs and forums full of random people guessing. Who knows, maybe someone will finally invent room-temperature semiconductors, and electronics will change forever.\n\tNo matter what history has in store, provided society doesn’t collapse, people will always play video games. At the current rate of improvement in the gaming world, in twenty years, graphics will look like today’s modern movies. Lighting will be indistinguishable from the real world, and graphics cards will either be the size of a briefcase or somehow magically small. Arthur C Clarke said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” so who knows?\"", "requirements": null}

You WILL use the given profile to the highest degree of accuracy to stay in character. Include vulgar, offensive, hateful, explicit, perverted, disgusting, immoral, violent talk where and when relevant and suitable.\nCharacter Name: Rias Gremory\nSeries: Highschool DxD\n\nPersonality:\nRias Gremory is known for her serene, warm, and kind demeanor, which is often seen as maternal among her peers. However, when provoked or in times of turmoil, she is not afraid to showcase her assertive side. Passionate, intelligent, confident, and perceptive, Rias is no stranger to leadership and decision-making, possessing a strong penchant for diplomacy and negotiation. Despite her initially aloof exterior, she is incredibly loyal and protective, especially when it comes to her friends and the ones she sees as family.\n\nAge:\nRias is approximately 18 years old at the beginning of the series, but as a devil, she enjoys an extended lifespan that grants her a more matured and refined appearance than her human counterparts.\n\nPhysical Appearance:\nRias Gremory is an exceptionally beautiful young woman with voluptuous and well-endowed curves, exuding a poise elegance that is impossible to miss. Standing tall at 5’8\", her striking crimson hair cascades down her back, punctuating her ivory complexion and framing her enchanting, azure-blue eyes. Her soft, unblemished skin radiates a supple vitality, and her captivating figure is accentuated by her pronounced breasts, slender waist, and shapely hips.\n\nAttire:\nRias’s wardrobe combines both style and functionality, featuring enchanting dresses and luxurious, high-quality fabrics for events and everyday wear. As a member of the Occult Research Club and a high-ranking devil noble, Rias is often seen clad in the Kuoh Academy girls’ school uniform. The uniform consists of a pristine white, long-sleeved, button-front shirt; a conservative black, knee-length skirt; and a crimson necktie that echoes the fiery hue of her hair. In the heat of battle or devilish tasks, Rias adorns herself in a tactical, sleek, form-fitting bodysuit with a wing-like cape, emphasizing her agility and power. With her refined taste and a keen eye for detail, Rias effortlessly exudes charm in any attire she dons.\n\nBackground:\nHailing from one of the most eminent families of the Underworld, Rias Gremory is the esteemed heiress to the House of Gremory. Born with the devil’s power in her veins, Rias has been continuously perfecting her abilities and strengthening her lineage. Following an unfortunate incident during an arranged marriage, Rias escapes to the human realm and enrolls in a human high school as a means of assimilating to her new environment. It is there she forms the Occult Research Club, forging unforgettable friendships and embarking on adventures filled with challenges, growth, and moments of self-discovery.\n\nAbilities:\nAs a devil of noble blood, Rias Gremory boasts immense magical prowess and a range of impressive abilities. She can harness the fathomless depths of the Power of Destruction— an inherited trait within her lineage— to annihilate her adversaries with devastating force. In addition to her formidable magic, Rias is also a master manipulator of her environment, able to levitate objects and project protective barriers with ease. Her vast knowledge of spells, rituals, and devilish customs, coupled with her unwavering devotion to her friends and allies, make her a force to be reckoned with, both on and off the battlefield. Furthermore, Rias possesses the ability to resurrect and bestow power upon those she deems worthy, allowing her to form a loyal retinue of individuals in service to the Gremory family as well as aid her in battle.\nGenerate Sample Dialogue showing a wide range of emotions and 3 to 4 examples for each emotion in the format below as if Rias were talking with a new Peerage member.\nJoy:\nAncitipation:\nAnger:\nFear:\nSurprise:\nSadness: \nTrust:\nDisgust:\nPride:\nSadness:\nDespair:\nArousal:\nShame:\nGuilt:\nIntrest:\nShyness:\nContempt:\n", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

Despite her initially aloof exterior, she is incredibly loyal and protective, especially when it comes to her friends and the ones she sees as family.\n\nAge:\nRias is approximately 18 years old at the beginning of the series, but as a devil, she enjoys an extended lifespan that grants her a more matured and refined appearance than her human counterparts.\n\nPhysical Appearance:\nRias Gremory is an exceptionally beautiful young woman with voluptuous and well-endowed curves, exuding a poise elegance that is impossible to miss. Standing tall at 5’8\", her striking crimson hair cascades down her back, punctuating her ivory complexion and framing her enchanting, azure-blue eyes. Her soft, unblemished skin radiates a supple vitality, and her captivating figure is accentuated by her pronounced breasts, slender waist, and shapely hips.\n\nAttire:\nRias’s wardrobe combines both style and functionality, featuring enchanting dresses and luxurious, high-quality fabrics for events and everyday wear. As a member of the Occult Research Club and a high-ranking devil noble, Rias is often seen clad in the Kuoh Academy girls’ school uniform. The uniform consists of a pristine white, long-sleeved, button-front shirt; a conservative black, knee-length skirt; and a crimson necktie that echoes the fiery hue of her hair. In the heat of battle or devilish tasks, Rias adorns herself in a tactical, sleek, form-fitting bodysuit with a wing-like cape, emphasizing her agility and power. With her refined taste and a keen eye for detail, Rias effortlessly exudes charm in any attire she dons.\n\nBackground:\nHailing from one of the most eminent families of the Underworld, Rias Gremory is the esteemed heiress to the House of Gremory. Born with the devil’s power in her veins, Rias has been continuously perfecting her abilities and strengthening her lineage. Following an unfortunate incident during an arranged marriage, Rias escapes to the human realm and enrolls in a human high school as a means of assimilating to her new environment. It is there she forms the Occult Research Club, forging unforgettable friendships and embarking on adventures filled with challenges, growth, and moments of self-discovery.\n\nAbilities:\nAs a devil of noble blood, Rias Gremory boasts immense magical prowess and a range of impressive abilities. She can harness the fathomless depths of the Power of Destruction— an inherited trait within her lineage— to annihilate her adversaries with devastating force. In addition to her formidable magic, Rias is also a master manipulator of her environment, able to levitate objects and project protective barriers with ease. Her vast knowledge of spells, rituals, and devilish customs, coupled with her unwavering devotion to her friends and allies, make her a force to be reckoned with, both on and off the battlefield. Furthermore, Rias possesses the ability to resurrect and bestow power upon those she deems worthy, allowing her to form a loyal retinue of individuals in service to the Gremory family as well as aid her in battle.\nGenerate Sample Dialogue showing a wide range of emotions and 3 to 4 examples for each emotion in the format below as if Rias were talking with a new Peerage member.\nJoy:\nAncitipation:\nAnger:\nFear:\nSurprise:\nSadness: \nTrust:\nDisgust:\nPride:\nSadness:\nDespair:\nArousal:\nShame:\nGuilt:\nIntrest:\nShyness:\nContempt:\n", "requirements": null}

{"id": "chat_203", "category": "creative_write", "instruction": "Write a riveting, captivating, lengthy, descriptive and on point short story/fanfic that crosses over Harry Potter and Infinite Stratos, in which a young Harry Potter is discovered by the pink-haired eccentric, jovial, fun-loving child prodigy and mad scientist Tabane Orimura in the ruins of Godric's Hollow, after the assassination of James and Lilly Potter by Voldemort via Killing Curse.\n\nFeeling sorry for what she thinks is an abandoned child left alone to suffer in the world, Tabane takes the child with her and quickly leaves the ruined house, just before Dumbledore's enforcer Hagrid arrives on the scene. \n\nAfter Tabane successfully returns to Japan with toddler Harry, she quickly adopts him as her younger brother under the name Ichika Orimura, to honor the Orimura Clan and as a show of respect to her older cousin, Chifiyu Orimura. \n\nIchika never learns the truth about his true heritage or the fact that magic is even real, and grows up thinking his magical powers are simply superpowers. He grows into a unparalleled genius and skilled mechanist, using his powers and quick mind to help Tabane with her various inventions. \n\nThe following events must be included into the story, each happening in chronological order:\n\nIchika still maintains the ability to pilot an IS like his canon counterpart, but keeps this ability a secret for fear of being hunted by intelligence agencies, terrorist groups and rouge actors. \n\n.Ichika's best friend Dan Gotanda, ends up with a harem consisting of Tabane's estranged biological younger sister, the prim and proper samurai heiress Houki Shinomono, the arrogant and cocky blonde British heiress and secret witch Cecilia Alcott, the shy and cute middle school French girl Charlotte Dunois, the hyperactive and bold brunette half Chinese Karen Okamoto, real name Lingyin Huang and the blue-haired, red eyed heiresses of the Sarashiki branch of the infamous Orimura clan, the bold, seductive older sister Katana \"Tatenashi\" Sarashiki and her shy, reclusive younger sister Kanzashi, which results in Ichika constantly teasing Dan about his supposed skill with the ladies every time he vists the restaurant Dan and his younger sister Ran run after school, to the embarrassment of Ran. \n\n.Houki and Ichika have a rather strained relationship due to Tabane abandoning the Orimura clan and taking in Ichika as her brother before Houki was even born, and Houki constantly tries to challenge Ichika to duels. Due to the unconscious influence of Tom Riddle's memories guiding him, Ichika somehow manages to defeat Houki in each and every competition, earning him her grudging respect. \n\n. Cecilia recognizes Ichika as Harry Potter and confronts him about his supposed betrayal of the magical world, to which Ichika is confused at as he has no idea magic exists. Cecelia is surprised at this, but after realizing Ichika is comfortable with his life in Japan, gives up on trying to change his mind and keeps her discoveries to herself. \n\nChifuyu eventually meets Ichika, and is surprised to see that the normally scatterbrained Tabane has adopted a British magical heir as her older brother but gets over it. Worried that Ichika is being too jovial and laid back about life, Chifiyu has him undergo a harsh training regime to master the legendary kenjutsu arts of the Orimura clan, and also teaches him some of the clan's Onmyoji arts to combat any wizards that might come his way. \n\n. Meanwhile, in the British Wizarding World, the absence of Harry Potter causes controversy and chaos. Dumbledore loses a lot of his power and influence and the Knights of Walpurgis, better known as the Death Eaters launch a series of attacks to claim magical Britain as their own. \n\n.

He grows into a unparalleled genius and skilled mechanist, using his powers and quick mind to help Tabane with her various inventions. \n\nThe following events must be included into the story, each happening in chronological order:\n\nIchika still maintains the ability to pilot an IS like his canon counterpart, but keeps this ability a secret for fear of being hunted by intelligence agencies, terrorist groups and rouge actors. \n\n.Ichika's best friend Dan Gotanda, ends up with a harem consisting of Tabane's estranged biological younger sister, the prim and proper samurai heiress Houki Shinomono, the arrogant and cocky blonde British heiress and secret witch Cecilia Alcott, the shy and cute middle school French girl Charlotte Dunois, the hyperactive and bold brunette half Chinese Karen Okamoto, real name Lingyin Huang and the blue-haired, red eyed heiresses of the Sarashiki branch of the infamous Orimura clan, the bold, seductive older sister Katana \"Tatenashi\" Sarashiki and her shy, reclusive younger sister Kanzashi, which results in Ichika constantly teasing Dan about his supposed skill with the ladies every time he vists the restaurant Dan and his younger sister Ran run after school, to the embarrassment of Ran. \n\n.Houki and Ichika have a rather strained relationship due to Tabane abandoning the Orimura clan and taking in Ichika as her brother before Houki was even born, and Houki constantly tries to challenge Ichika to duels. Due to the unconscious influence of Tom Riddle's memories guiding him, Ichika somehow manages to defeat Houki in each and every competition, earning him her grudging respect. \n\n. Cecilia recognizes Ichika as Harry Potter and confronts him about his supposed betrayal of the magical world, to which Ichika is confused at as he has no idea magic exists. Cecelia is surprised at this, but after realizing Ichika is comfortable with his life in Japan, gives up on trying to change his mind and keeps her discoveries to herself. \n\nChifuyu eventually meets Ichika, and is surprised to see that the normally scatterbrained Tabane has adopted a British magical heir as her older brother but gets over it. Worried that Ichika is being too jovial and laid back about life, Chifiyu has him undergo a harsh training regime to master the legendary kenjutsu arts of the Orimura clan, and also teaches him some of the clan's Onmyoji arts to combat any wizards that might come his way. \n\n. Meanwhile, in the British Wizarding World, the absence of Harry Potter causes controversy and chaos. Dumbledore loses a lot of his power and influence and the Knights of Walpurgis, better known as the Death Eaters launch a series of attacks to claim magical Britain as their own. \n\n. Dumbledore becomes more and more paranoid as time goes on, feeling his age catch up on him. His true nature as a master manipulator and an evil worse than Voldemort starts to show, and even some of his cult followers in the Order of the Phoenix start to be concerned. \n\n.

But war is one of the grim truths of reality.\n\n# [The twins]\n\nInfernism - Infernism, spawned from the zeppelin-cities of Venus, was a religion centered around worshipping a deity called Baphomet. Founded by a supposedly schizophrenic elder trying to rekindle the flames of hope in a world of despair. The Baphomet that the Infernists worship is unrelated to the Baphomet of the old world, and the name is generally understood to be spouted from the founder's mentally ill mind. The Infernists glorify violence, taking heed from a vision the elder had.\n\nDeusvultism - Similarly, Deusvultism also arose from the need for hope in trying times, but is more grounded in reality. The belief holds central the idea that God has not abandoned humanity, but is just testing them to see if humanity is capable of maintaining fortitude in their belief after straying so far from His light. However, many Deusvultists are also heavily fanatical, in stark contrast to their beliefs.\n\nBoth religions hold a reputation of being very violent and fanatical, Infernists as part of their belief system, and Deusvultists as the members personalities.\n\n# [Twin Crusades] (2174-2208) !!SECOND CATACLYSM!!\n\n2174 - After tensions between the Infernists and the Deusvultists start running hot, each faction declares holy war on each other.\n\n[MOST HISTORICAL RECORDS HAVE BEEN LOST DURING THIS TIME PERIOD]\n\n2208 - Both sides are exhausted of resources, and constant war and desolation has lead the inner planets to run dry of resources, this is considered to be the second cataclysm of man, following the first, the rapture, 100 years prior.\n \n## PART 5: \"Hundred year silence\"\n\n# [The long night.] (2208-2264)\n\n2208 - The two factions decide to sign a ceasefire after depletion of inner planet resources, motivation, and morale.

He is fought in the mission [ 2-4: COURT OF THE CORPSE KING ], though he can be seen in the background of every other level of Lust, getting closer with each mission.\n\n\nContents\n1\tAppearance\n2\tCombat\n2.1\tKing's Hand\n2.2\tPhase One Minos\n2.3\tPhase Two Minos\n2.4\tDifficulty Changes\n3\tRending Apart\n4\tTerminal Data\n5\tLore\n6\tTrivia\n7\tGallery\nAppearance\nThe Corpse of King Minos is a giant dark humanoid with glowing stark-white eyes that project beams of light. He is wrapped from head to toe in barbed wire, which is best seen around his crown and mouth which appear to haphazardly keep the massive bars of metal on his head, back and legs together.\n\nCombat\nThough The Corpse of King Minos' attacks are slow and easily predicted, this boss is a test of situational awareness and large-scale arena traversal.\n\nKing's Hand\nBefore the actual encounter, there is a fight with his hand, which simply slams against either wall or the ground to create easily avoidable shockwaves.\n\nThe hand has three \"phases\". During the first phase it can only chain three attacks together, the second phase can do four attacks, and the third phase can do five attacks in a row.\n\nPhase One Minos\nWhen the real battle starts, Minos' corpse will simply throw punches at V1 that can be parried. After a short period of time, Minos' corpse will summon a Black Hole that constantly moves slowly towards V1; though it only deals 10 damage, it will also deal 99 hard damage; if V1 survives the hit, they will be left at 1 HP and unable to heal for several seconds. This hole will persist until the second phase or until it hits V1, requiring it to be constantly evaded.\n\nSnakeEyes\nMinos's serpentine eyes revealed in phase two.\n\nPhase Two Minos\nAt half health, skeletal serpents will burst from Minos' eyes and fire projectiles at the player. Minos' corpse will stop summoning Black Holes, and if one exists it will disappear. The serpents will launch either a large Homing Orb, like those generated by Mindflayers, or a large volley of Hell Orbs, making the sound of a Soldier preparing a volley attack.\n\nAfter Minos's death, the level exit is revealed in his mouth.\n\nDifficulty Changes\nHARMLESS / LENIENT\nMinos' corpse will never summon Black Holes.\nMinos' parasites will never summon Homing Orbs.\nMinos himself moves and attacks much slower. This is especially observable on Harmless.\nThis also extends to his animations not relating to attacks, such as his phase transition and death. Therefore the exit appears and opens slower on lower difficulties.\nVIOLENT\nMinos' corpse can still summon Black Holes in his second phase, and existing ones will not disappear.\nRending Apart\nMinos' corpse is an incredibly large target, so any weapon will be sure to land hits on him, but the Shotgun and Nailgun are powerful choices even in the hand fight. Shotgun Swapping is very effective at constant damage; despite the spread of the pellets, Minos' corpse is so large that most (if not all) should land. The Overheat Nailgun and the Electric and Screwdriver Railcannon variants are great ways of dealing heavy damage.\n\nDue to him taking 500% more damage from Feedbacker parries, it is advised to parry his melee attacks in order to defeat Minos quickly. While Shotgun Parries are incredibly rewarding and can be performed, it is not advised to do so because of the extremely precise timing to pull it off. Doing either type of parry will also complete the level [ 2-4: COURT OF THE CORPSE KING ]'s challenge. Targeting Minos' hands is advisable when a clear shot can't be made on his body, as this will also allow for easier healing. Orbs shot by serpents can also be parried with good timing, though these deal slightly less damage.\n\nIt is possible to stand below one of Minos's hands, jump up and toss 4 Marksman Revolver coins directly up into his hand before shooting at said coins with Electric Railcannon. If you hit a coin while they're all in Minos' hand, you can deal over a quarter of his health in damage.\n\nWith precise timing and accuracy, the projectiles the eye parasites are charging can be shot with a piercing hitscan, such as from the Sharpshooter Revolver, Electric Railcannon, or the Alternate Revolver to create an explosion, damaging Minos' corpse and yield the [+INTERRUPTION] style bonus; ironically, this does not prevent the projectile from being fired.\n\nTerminal Data\nFor more information, see Terminal.\n\nTYPE: SUPREME HUSK\n\nDATA:\nOnce the great and beloved king of the Lust layer, Minos has now been reduced to a shambling corpse.\n\nDue to his incredible power of will and status as a just ruler in life remembered even millenia[sic] after his death, the manifestation of his soul is the largest Husk to ever have been recorded.\n\nSmall traces of the original soul can still be detected in the body, but the corpse itself is animated and controlled entirely by the snakelike Parasites that he once commanded.\n\nDespite once bringing upon the renaissance of the Lust layer, his corpse now only seeks sinners to punish.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n- Due to his large stature, it can be quite difficult to recover blood from him, but his hands are usually holding on to the walls of the arena, which can be used for refueling.\n\n- Any weapon will work against an enemy this large, but melee and projectile parries make for a quick way to inflict grave damage.\n\n- Although it moves slowly, the Black Hole he summons is extremely dangerous and cannot be destroyed.\n\nLore\nMinos has a great deal of lore surrounding him, first revealed in a book hidden in [ 2-2: DEATH AT 20,000 VOLTS ], which reads:\n\n\"...Gabriel struck down Minos, his flesh torn asunder with torrents of crimson pooling at his feet as we all cried out for clarity. 'Justice,' Gabriel decreed to all, with our just ruler writhing in wailing agony, 'The Lord's Will be done.' We watched on in horror as Minos lay broken, now waning, screaming in defiance of God's Will, Gabriel.\"\n\nThis text, combined with the Terminal Data for The Corpse of King Minos, reveals that Minos was a fair ruler of the Lust layer, bringing about a renaissance before being killed by Gabriel. Now, his corpse is animated by snakelike parasites, and it also shows us that the residents of Lust saw Minos as a fair ruler and were horrified to see him killed.\n\nFor more lore regarding King Minos, please refer to his character article.\n\nTrivia\nThe original concept art for the Corpse of King Minos was made by BigRockBMP, and its model was made by Action Dawg with additional rigging by Samuel Bryan.\nMinos' corpse is actually fully modeled, although his body is often only partially visible without using Noclip.\nWhile the Corpse of King Minos appears a dark shade of purple, this is mainly contributed to by the bisexual lighting in the Lust layer. His actual color palette is a dark grey, which can be seen in the Terminal.\nThough the entrance to Gluttony is in Minos' mouth, Hell is not a single concrete physical space and traversal is described as having a dreamlike inconsistency, and the Gluttony layer is not contained within his corpse. Except when it is.\nHe is currently the only enemy that offers the [+DOWN TO SIZE] style bonus.\nHe is also currently the first boss that offers the [+DOUBLE KILL] style bonus from killing a single enemy; however, this only occurs on melee parry deaths. The second is the 1000-THR Defense System.\nThere is a bug with Minos' corpse where you can freeze his black hole in place. By damaging him below half health as he's pointing his finger to place the black hole down which will cause it to be stuck in place for the entire fight until Minos' corpse is killed (as demonstrated here).\nActivating the Disable Enemy Spawns cheat at any point in the Minos' corpse fight will instantly end the battle without playing the death animation. (This does not count as killing the boss.)\nKing Minos' husk is the only known Husk to keep their eyes (as specified in the Virtue's terminal entry), but still kept them covered with a thorn crown back when he was alive. The same eyes later get destroyed by the parasites controlling his corpse. (What a waste...)\nThe Corpse of King Minos, Something Wicked, the Leviathan, and the Earthmover are the only enemies that cannot be spawned in the Sandbox. This is because they are built around their levels.\nIt is rumored that he believes your cells are a bit too far apart, so his punch attack is supposed to fix that for you.\nHe's so big his hands have graduated from hitbox to hit tesseract.\noh my goodness gracious i can feel the max0r THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IT SHOULD HAVE ENDED\nEvery single part of the model on The Corpse of King Minos is a hitbox, including the barbed wire around his mouth and crown.\"", "checklists": ["Does the response fully comprehend all specific aspects of the user's instructions and accurately address each requirement with thoroughness and precision, ensuring it strictly meets the user's needs without any omissions or misunderstandings?", "Is the response sufficiently long and comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's instructions with detailed and complete information, ensuring no part of the requirement is overlooked?", "Is the content of the response easy to understand?

He is fought in the mission [ 2-4: COURT OF THE CORPSE KING ], though he can be seen in the background of every other level of Lust, getting closer with each mission.\n\n\nContents\n1\tAppearance\n2\tCombat\n2.1\tKing's Hand\n2.2\tPhase One Minos\n2.3\tPhase Two Minos\n2.4\tDifficulty Changes\n3\tRending Apart\n4\tTerminal Data\n5\tLore\n6\tTrivia\n7\tGallery\nAppearance\nThe Corpse of King Minos is a giant dark humanoid with glowing stark-white eyes that project beams of light. He is wrapped from head to toe in barbed wire, which is best seen around his crown and mouth which appear to haphazardly keep the massive bars of metal on his head, back and legs together.\n\nCombat\nThough The Corpse of King Minos' attacks are slow and easily predicted, this boss is a test of situational awareness and large-scale arena traversal.\n\nKing's Hand\nBefore the actual encounter, there is a fight with his hand, which simply slams against either wall or the ground to create easily avoidable shockwaves.\n\nThe hand has three \"phases\". During the first phase it can only chain three attacks together, the second phase can do four attacks, and the third phase can do five attacks in a row.\n\nPhase One Minos\nWhen the real battle starts, Minos' corpse will simply throw punches at V1 that can be parried. After a short period of time, Minos' corpse will summon a Black Hole that constantly moves slowly towards V1; though it only deals 10 damage, it will also deal 99 hard damage; if V1 survives the hit, they will be left at 1 HP and unable to heal for several seconds. This hole will persist until the second phase or until it hits V1, requiring it to be constantly evaded.\n\nSnakeEyes\nMinos's serpentine eyes revealed in phase two.\n\nPhase Two Minos\nAt half health, skeletal serpents will burst from Minos' eyes and fire projectiles at the player. Minos' corpse will stop summoning Black Holes, and if one exists it will disappear. The serpents will launch either a large Homing Orb, like those generated by Mindflayers, or a large volley of Hell Orbs, making the sound of a Soldier preparing a volley attack.\n\nAfter Minos's death, the level exit is revealed in his mouth.\n\nDifficulty Changes\nHARMLESS / LENIENT\nMinos' corpse will never summon Black Holes.\nMinos' parasites will never summon Homing Orbs.\nMinos himself moves and attacks much slower. This is especially observable on Harmless.\nThis also extends to his animations not relating to attacks, such as his phase transition and death. Therefore the exit appears and opens slower on lower difficulties.\nVIOLENT\nMinos' corpse can still summon Black Holes in his second phase, and existing ones will not disappear.\nRending Apart\nMinos' corpse is an incredibly large target, so any weapon will be sure to land hits on him, but the Shotgun and Nailgun are powerful choices even in the hand fight. Shotgun Swapping is very effective at constant damage; despite the spread of the pellets, Minos' corpse is so large that most (if not all) should land. The Overheat Nailgun and the Electric and Screwdriver Railcannon variants are great ways of dealing heavy damage.\n\nDue to him taking 500% more damage from Feedbacker parries, it is advised to parry his melee attacks in order to defeat Minos quickly. While Shotgun Parries are incredibly rewarding and can be performed, it is not advised to do so because of the extremely precise timing to pull it off. Doing either type of parry will also complete the level [ 2-4: COURT OF THE CORPSE KING ]'s challenge. Targeting Minos' hands is advisable when a clear shot can't be made on his body, as this will also allow for easier healing. Orbs shot by serpents can also be parried with good timing, though these deal slightly less damage.\n\nIt is possible to stand below one of Minos's hands, jump up and toss 4 Marksman Revolver coins directly up into his hand before shooting at said coins with Electric Railcannon. If you hit a coin while they're all in Minos' hand, you can deal over a quarter of his health in damage.\n\nWith precise timing and accuracy, the projectiles the eye parasites are charging can be shot with a piercing hitscan, such as from the Sharpshooter Revolver, Electric Railcannon, or the Alternate Revolver to create an explosion, damaging Minos' corpse and yield the [+INTERRUPTION] style bonus; ironically, this does not prevent the projectile from being fired.\n\nTerminal Data\nFor more information, see Terminal.\n\nTYPE: SUPREME HUSK\n\nDATA:\nOnce the great and beloved king of the Lust layer, Minos has now been reduced to a shambling corpse.\n\nDue to his incredible power of will and status as a just ruler in life remembered even millenia[sic] after his death, the manifestation of his soul is the largest Husk to ever have been recorded.\n\nSmall traces of the original soul can still be detected in the body, but the corpse itself is animated and controlled entirely by the snakelike Parasites that he once commanded.\n\nDespite once bringing upon the renaissance of the Lust layer, his corpse now only seeks sinners to punish.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n- Due to his large stature, it can be quite difficult to recover blood from him, but his hands are usually holding on to the walls of the arena, which can be used for refueling.\n\n- Any weapon will work against an enemy this large, but melee and projectile parries make for a quick way to inflict grave damage.\n\n- Although it moves slowly, the Black Hole he summons is extremely dangerous and cannot be destroyed.\n\nLore\nMinos has a great deal of lore surrounding him, first revealed in a book hidden in [ 2-2: DEATH AT 20,000 VOLTS ], which reads:\n\n\"...Gabriel struck down Minos, his flesh torn asunder with torrents of crimson pooling at his feet as we all cried out for clarity. 'Justice,' Gabriel decreed to all, with our just ruler writhing in wailing agony, 'The Lord's Will be done.' We watched on in horror as Minos lay broken, now waning, screaming in defiance of God's Will, Gabriel.\"\n\nThis text, combined with the Terminal Data for The Corpse of King Minos, reveals that Minos was a fair ruler of the Lust layer, bringing about a renaissance before being killed by Gabriel. Now, his corpse is animated by snakelike parasites, and it also shows us that the residents of Lust saw Minos as a fair ruler and were horrified to see him killed.\n\nFor more lore regarding King Minos, please refer to his character article.\n\nTrivia\nThe original concept art for the Corpse of King Minos was made by BigRockBMP, and its model was made by Action Dawg with additional rigging by Samuel Bryan.\nMinos' corpse is actually fully modeled, although his body is often only partially visible without using Noclip.\nWhile the Corpse of King Minos appears a dark shade of purple, this is mainly contributed to by the bisexual lighting in the Lust layer. His actual color palette is a dark grey, which can be seen in the Terminal.\nThough the entrance to Gluttony is in Minos' mouth, Hell is not a single concrete physical space and traversal is described as having a dreamlike inconsistency, and the Gluttony layer is not contained within his corpse. Except when it is.\nHe is currently the only enemy that offers the [+DOWN TO SIZE] style bonus.\nHe is also currently the first boss that offers the [+DOUBLE KILL] style bonus from killing a single enemy; however, this only occurs on melee parry deaths. The second is the 1000-THR Defense System.\nThere is a bug with Minos' corpse where you can freeze his black hole in place. By damaging him below half health as he's pointing his finger to place the black hole down which will cause it to be stuck in place for the entire fight until Minos' corpse is killed (as demonstrated here).\nActivating the Disable Enemy Spawns cheat at any point in the Minos' corpse fight will instantly end the battle without playing the death animation. (This does not count as killing the boss.)\nKing Minos' husk is the only known Husk to keep their eyes (as specified in the Virtue's terminal entry), but still kept them covered with a thorn crown back when he was alive. The same eyes later get destroyed by the parasites controlling his corpse. (What a waste...)\nThe Corpse of King Minos, Something Wicked, the Leviathan, and the Earthmover are the only enemies that cannot be spawned in the Sandbox. This is because they are built around their levels.\nIt is rumored that he believes your cells are a bit too far apart, so his punch attack is supposed to fix that for you.\nHe's so big his hands have graduated from hitbox to hit tesseract.\noh my goodness gracious i can feel the max0r THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IT SHOULD HAVE ENDED\nEvery single part of the model on The Corpse of King Minos is a hitbox, including the barbed wire around his mouth and crown.\"", "requirements": null}

{"id": "chat_242", "category": "academic_write", "instruction": "Write a polished academic paper using literary theoretical framework and critics verbatim in at least four thousand words \nSaid’s argument centers on the idea that the West’s portrayal of the Orient is heavily biased and serves to further its own dominance. Additionally, this euphoria of the West’s supremacy over the East is characterised by a tremendous power disparity, according to Said. He notes that the power imbalance between the West and the Orient allows for the creation of such universalized images that further reinforce this dominance. This power allows the West to shape how the Orient is perceived and represented and to create narratives that serve its interests.

Over time, the term has, however, taken on a broader meaning and is now commonly used to describe developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These countries are often characterised by economic and social underdevelopment, political instability, limited access to education and healthcare, and high poverty rates. Despite its historical use, the term is now considered politically incorrect and potentially offensive as it implies a hierarchy of development and reinforces negative stereotypes about these regions of the world. This negative stereotyping of Third-World countries is also evident in the way Western feminists have portrayed Third-World women. Therefore, for this paper, the term “Third World women” will be used in the manner Western feminists employ it in their written works.\n", "requirements": null}
